<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>

<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>

<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>

<s> i was full of eager expectations as i thought how soon i should perhaps be in the presence of wordsworth that after long years of waiting of distant reverential admiration and love i was as i hoped to be favoured with a personal interview with the great poet philosopher to whom you and i and so many many others feel that we are under the deepest obligation for the good which has come to us from his writings <\s>
<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>

<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>

<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>
<s> to the above memorandum i now sept <\s>
<s> 1874 add two items of which i retain a distinct remembrance <\s>
<s> 1 he was in favour of the officiating clergyman being allowed to introduce into his reading of the lessons in church the authorised marginal corrections <\s>
<s> 2 he expressed in very strong terms his opinion that the prefatory portion of the marriage service should be altered so as to make it not only less repulsive to modern feelings but more accordant with the higher aspects of the union to be solemnised <\s>
<s> passion in poetry one day speaking of passion as an element of poetry he referred to his own poems and said that he thought there was a stronger fire of passion than was elsewhere to be found among them in the lyrical burst near the conclusion of the song at the feast of brougham castle armour rusting in his halls on the blood of clifford calls quell the scot exclaims the lance bear me to the heart of france is the longing of the shield <\s>
<s> chronological classification of poems many years ago i expressed to wordsworth a wish that his poems were printed in the order of their composition assigning as reasons for the wish the great interest which would attach to observing the progressive development of the poet's thought and the interpretative value of the light mutually reflected by poems of the same period <\s>
<s> i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion <\s>
<s> he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual <\s>
<s> i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in after days the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element <\s>
<s> verbal criticism wordsworth not only sympathised with the feelings expressed in southey's touching lines upon the dead but admired very much the easy flow of the verse and the perfect freedom from strain in the expression by which they are marked <\s>
<s> yet in the first two stanzas he noted three flaws and suggested changes by which they might have been easily avoided <\s>
<s> i have underlined the words he took exception to my days among the dead are past around me i behold where'er these casual eyes are cast the mighty minds of old my never failing friends are they with whom i converse day by day <\s>
<s> with them i take delight in weal and seek relief in woe and while i understand and feel how much to them i owe my cheeks have often been bedew'd with tears of thoughtful gratitude <\s>
<s> in the first stanza for where'er these casual eyes are cast which he objected to as not simple and natural and as scarcely correct he suggested where'er a casual look i cast and for converse the accent of which he condemned as belonging to the noun and not to the verb he suggested commune <\s>
<s> in the second stanza he pointed out the improper sequence of tenses in the third and fifth lines which he corrected by reading in the latter my cheeks are oftentimes bedew'd <\s>
<s> of the narrative poems of his friend well executed as he considered them and of the mainly external action of imagination or fancy in which they deal i have certainly heard him pronounce a very depreciatory opinion whether i ever heard him use the hard words attributed to him i would not give five shillings for a ream of them i cannot now assert but if used they were said in reference to the nobler kind of imaginative power which reveals to man the deep places and sublimer affinities of his own being <\s>
<s> but to some others of southey's verses as well as to the lines above quoted and to his prose writings in general he was wont to give liberal praise and no one could doubt the sincerity and warmth of his admiration of the intellect and virtues of the man or the brotherly affection towards him which he not unfrequently expressed <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>
<s> to the above memorandum i now sept <\s>
<s> 1874 add two items of which i retain a distinct remembrance <\s>
<s> 1 he was in favour of the officiating clergyman being allowed to introduce into his reading of the lessons in church the authorised marginal corrections <\s>

<s> the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth <\s>
<s> it was the sunday evening after the event occurred that my brother and i walked over to the mount where we found the poet alone <\s>

<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>
<s> it appeared that his death was a relief from intense pain which however subsided at the interval of a few days before the event and that shortly after this cessation of agony he fell into a comatose state <\s>
<s> the most interesting part of the letter was the statement that the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other relatives and friends around him to give them his blessing and to express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the depth of his trust in his saviour christ <\s>
<s> as i heard this i was at once deeply glad at the substance and deeply affected by wordsworth's emotion in reading it <\s>
<s> when he came to this part his voice at first faltered and then broke but soon divine faith that the change was a blest one overcame aught of human grief and he concluded in an equable though subdued tone <\s>
<s> before i quit this subject i will tell you what i was interested in hearing from a person of the highest abilities 266 whom i had the good fortune of meeting at rydal mount <\s>
<s> he said that he had visited coleridge about a month before his death and had perceived at once his countenance pervaded by a most remarkable serenity <\s>
<s> on being congratulated on his appearance coleridge replied that he did now for the first time begin to hope from the mitigation of his pains that his health was undergoing a permanent improvement alas <\s>
<s> he was deceived yet may we not consider this hopeful feeling which is i believe by no means uncommon to be under such circumstances a valuable blessing ); but that what he felt most thankful for was the deep calm peace of mind which he then enjoyed a peace such as he had never before experienced or scarcely hoped for <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>

<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>

<s> attaching a full value to the singular yet easily imagined and most picturesque circumstances of the adventurer's position to the admirable painting of the scenes and to the knowledge displayed of the working of human feelings he yet felt sure that the intense interest created by the story arose chiefly from the extraordinary energy and resource of the hero under his difficult circumstances from their being so far beyond what it was natural to expect or what would have been exhibited by the average of men and that similarly the high pleasure derived from his successes and good fortunes arose from the peculiar source of these uncommon merits of his character <\s>
<s> i have heard him pronounce that the tragedy of othello plato's records of the last scenes of the career of socrates and isaac walton's life of george herbert were in his opinion the most pathetic of human compositions <\s>
<s> in a walk one day after stopping according to his custom to claim admiration for some happy aspect of the landscape or beautiful composition on a smaller scale of natural objects caught by him at the precisely best point of view in the midst of his conversation on other subjects he added good humouredly that there were three callings for success in which nature had furnished him with qualifications the callings of poet landscape gardener and critic of pictures and works of art <\s>
<s> on hearing this i could not but remember how his qualifications for the second were proved by the surprising variety of natural beauties he managed to display to their best advantage from the very circumscribed limits of the garden at rydal mount an invisible hand of art everywhere working to use his own exquisite expression in the very spirit of nature and how many there were who have owed the charm of their grounds and gardens to direction sought from his well known taste and feeling <\s>
<s> as to works of art his criticism was not that of one versed in the history of the schools but always proceeding upon first principles the prima philosophia as he called it and it was as it appeared to me of the highest order <\s>

<s> the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth <\s>

<s> one of the first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been he said his friend for more than thirty years <\s>
<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>

<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>

<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>

<s> it was about noon on the 18th of august 1849 that i set out with my friends from their house near bowness to ride to ambleside <\s>

<s> it was my first day among the english lakes and i enjoyed keenly the loveliness which was spread out before me <\s>
<s> my friends congratulated me on the clearness of the atmosphere and the bright skies <\s>
<s> twilight is all important in bringing out the full beauty of the lake region and in this respect i was very fortunate <\s>
<s> i had already been deeply moved by the tranquil beauty of windermere for as i came out of the cottage formerly professor wilson's where i had passed the night there it lay in all its grandeur its clear waters its green islands and its girdle of solemn mountains <\s>
<s> it was quite dark when i had been conducted to this cottage the night before so that i saw the lake for the first time in the light of early morning <\s>
<s> the first impression was confirmed by every new prospect as we rode along <\s>
<s> the vale seemed a very paradise for its sweet seclusion <\s>
<s> i had been told that after switzerland i should find little to attract me in this region but such was not the case <\s>
<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>
<s> the foliage is of the darkest green giving to the lake in which it is reflected the same sombre hue <\s>
<s> it seemed the fittest dwelling place for a poet amid all this quiet beauty <\s>
<s> it was half past one when we reached ambleside where i left mr <\s>
<s> b and walked on alone to rydal mount <\s>
<s> i was full of eager expectations as i thought how soon i should perhaps be in the presence of wordsworth that after long years of waiting of distant reverential admiration and love i was as i hoped to be favoured with a personal interview with the great poet philosopher to whom you and i and so many many others feel that we are under the deepest obligation for the good which has come to us from his writings <\s>
<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>

<s> feeling very grateful to you for the pleasure which that visit gave me and desiring to make a more minute record of it than either the letter i addressed to you from keswick or my journal written at the time contains i gladly comply with your request <\s>
<s> it was about noon on the 18th of august 1849 that i set out with my friends from their house near bowness to ride to ambleside <\s>
<s> our route was along the shore of lake windermere <\s>
<s> it was my first day among the english lakes and i enjoyed keenly the loveliness which was spread out before me <\s>
<s> my friends congratulated me on the clearness of the atmosphere and the bright skies <\s>
<s> twilight is all important in bringing out the full beauty of the lake region and in this respect i was very fortunate <\s>
<s> i had already been deeply moved by the tranquil beauty of windermere for as i came out of the cottage formerly professor wilson's where i had passed the night there it lay in all its grandeur its clear waters its green islands and its girdle of solemn mountains <\s>
<s> it was quite dark when i had been conducted to this cottage the night before so that i saw the lake for the first time in the light of early morning <\s>
<s> the first impression was confirmed by every new prospect as we rode along <\s>
<s> the vale seemed a very paradise for its sweet seclusion <\s>
<s> i had been told that after switzerland i should find little to attract me in this region but such was not the case <\s>
<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>
<s> the foliage is of the darkest green giving to the lake in which it is reflected the same sombre hue <\s>
<s> it seemed the fittest dwelling place for a poet amid all this quiet beauty <\s>
<s> it was half past one when we reached ambleside where i left mr <\s>
<s> b and walked on alone to rydal mount <\s>
<s> i was full of eager expectations as i thought how soon i should perhaps be in the presence of wordsworth that after long years of waiting of distant reverential admiration and love i was as i hoped to be favoured with a personal interview with the great poet philosopher to whom you and i and so many many others feel that we are under the deepest obligation for the good which has come to us from his writings <\s>
<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>
<s> i walked along the gravel pathway leading through shrubbery to the open space in front of the long two story cottage the poet's dwelling <\s>
<s> your sketch of the house by inman is a correct one but it gives no idea of the view from it which is its chief charm <\s>
<s> rydal mere with its islands and the mountains beyond it are all in sight <\s>
<s> i had but a hasty enjoyment of this beauty nor could i notice carefully the flowers which were blooming around <\s>
<s> it was evident that the greatest attention had been paid to the grounds for the flower beds were tastefully arranged and the gravel walks were in complete order <\s>
<s> one might be well content i thought to make his abode at a spot like this <\s>
<s> a boy of about twelve years was occupied at one of the flower beds as i passed by he followed me to the door and waited my commands <\s>
<s> i asked if mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth was in .... <\s>
<s> he was dining would i walk into the drawing room and wait a short time ... <\s>
<s> i was shown into the drawing room or study i know not which to call it .... <\s>
<s> here i am i said to myself in the great poet's house <\s>
<s> here his daily life is spent <\s>
<s> here in this room doubtless much of his poetry has been written words of power which are to go down with those of shakspeare and spenser and milton while our english tongue endures <\s>
<s> it was a long apartment the ceiling low with two windows at one end looking out on the lawn and shrubbery <\s>
<s> many engravings were on the walls <\s>
<s> the famous madonna of raphael known as that of the dresden gallery hung directly over the fire place <\s>
<s> attaching a full value to the singular yet easily imagined and most picturesque circumstances of the adventurer's position to the admirable painting of the scenes and to the knowledge displayed of the working of human feelings he yet felt sure that the intense interest created by the story arose chiefly from the extraordinary energy and resource of the hero under his difficult circumstances from their being so far beyond what it was natural to expect or what would have been exhibited by the average of men and that similarly the high pleasure derived from his successes and good fortunes arose from the peculiar source of these uncommon merits of his character <\s>
<s> i have heard him pronounce that the tragedy of othello plato's records of the last scenes of the career of socrates and isaac walton's life of george herbert were in his opinion the most pathetic of human compositions <\s>
<s> in a walk one day after stopping according to his custom to claim admiration for some happy aspect of the landscape or beautiful composition on a smaller scale of natural objects caught by him at the precisely best point of view in the midst of his conversation on other subjects he added good humouredly that there were three callings for success in which nature had furnished him with qualifications the callings of poet landscape gardener and critic of pictures and works of art <\s>
<s> on hearing this i could not but remember how his qualifications for the second were proved by the surprising variety of natural beauties he managed to display to their best advantage from the very circumscribed limits of the garden at rydal mount an invisible hand of art everywhere working to use his own exquisite expression in the very spirit of nature and how many there were who have owed the charm of their grounds and gardens to direction sought from his well known taste and feeling <\s>
<s> as to works of art his criticism was not that of one versed in the history of the schools but always proceeding upon first principles the prima philosophia as he called it and it was as it appeared to me of the highest order <\s>

<s> the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth <\s>
<s> it was the sunday evening after the event occurred that my brother and i walked over to the mount where we found the poet alone <\s>
<s> one of the first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been he said his friend for more than thirty years <\s>
<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>
<s> it appeared that his death was a relief from intense pain which however subsided at the interval of a few days before the event and that shortly after this cessation of agony he fell into a comatose state <\s>
<s> the most interesting part of the letter was the statement that the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other relatives and friends around him to give them his blessing and to express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the depth of his trust in his saviour christ <\s>
<s> as i heard this i was at once deeply glad at the substance and deeply affected by wordsworth's emotion in reading it <\s>
<s> when he came to this part his voice at first faltered and then broke but soon divine faith that the change was a blest one overcame aught of human grief and he concluded in an equable though subdued tone <\s>
<s> before i quit this subject i will tell you what i was interested in hearing from a person of the highest abilities 266 whom i had the good fortune of meeting at rydal mount <\s>
<s> he said that he had visited coleridge about a month before his death and had perceived at once his countenance pervaded by a most remarkable serenity <\s>
<s> on being congratulated on his appearance coleridge replied that he did now for the first time begin to hope from the mitigation of his pains that his health was undergoing a permanent improvement alas <\s>
<s> he was deceived yet may we not consider this hopeful feeling which is i believe by no means uncommon to be under such circumstances a valuable blessing ); but that what he felt most thankful for was the deep calm peace of mind which he then enjoyed a peace such as he had never before experienced or scarcely hoped for <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>
<s> to the above memorandum i now sept <\s>
<s> 1874 add two items of which i retain a distinct remembrance <\s>
<s> 1 he was in favour of the officiating clergyman being allowed to introduce into his reading of the lessons in church the authorised marginal corrections <\s>
<s> 2 he expressed in very strong terms his opinion that the prefatory portion of the marriage service should be altered so as to make it not only less repulsive to modern feelings but more accordant with the higher aspects of the union to be solemnised <\s>
<s> passion in poetry one day speaking of passion as an element of poetry he referred to his own poems and said that he thought there was a stronger fire of passion than was elsewhere to be found among them in the lyrical burst near the conclusion of the song at the feast of brougham castle armour rusting in his halls on the blood of clifford calls quell the scot exclaims the lance bear me to the heart of france is the longing of the shield <\s>
<s> chronological classification of poems many years ago i expressed to wordsworth a wish that his poems were printed in the order of their composition assigning as reasons for the wish the great interest which would attach to observing the progressive development of the poet's thought and the interpretative value of the light mutually reflected by poems of the same period <\s>
<s> i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion <\s>
<s> he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual <\s>
<s> i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in after days the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element <\s>
<s> verbal criticism wordsworth not only sympathised with the feelings expressed in southey's touching lines upon the dead but admired very much the easy flow of the verse and the perfect freedom from strain in the expression by which they are marked <\s>
<s> yet in the first two stanzas he noted three flaws and suggested changes by which they might have been easily avoided <\s>
<s> i have underlined the words he took exception to my days among the dead are past around me i behold where'er these casual eyes are cast the mighty minds of old my never failing friends are they with whom i converse day by day <\s>
<s> with them i take delight in weal and seek relief in woe and while i understand and feel how much to them i owe my cheeks have often been bedew'd with tears of thoughtful gratitude <\s>
<s> in the first stanza for where'er these casual eyes are cast which he objected to as not simple and natural and as scarcely correct he suggested where'er a casual look i cast and for converse the accent of which he condemned as belonging to the noun and not to the verb he suggested commune <\s>
<s> in the second stanza he pointed out the improper sequence of tenses in the third and fifth lines which he corrected by reading in the latter my cheeks are oftentimes bedew'd <\s>
<s> of the narrative poems of his friend well executed as he considered them and of the mainly external action of imagination or fancy in which they deal i have certainly heard him pronounce a very depreciatory opinion whether i ever heard him use the hard words attributed to him i would not give five shillings for a ream of them i cannot now assert but if used they were said in reference to the nobler kind of imaginative power which reveals to man the deep places and sublimer affinities of his own being <\s>
<s> but to some others of southey's verses as well as to the lines above quoted and to his prose writings in general he was wont to give liberal praise and no one could doubt the sincerity and warmth of his admiration of the intellect and virtues of the man or the brotherly affection towards him which he not unfrequently expressed <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>

<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>

<s> the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth <\s>
<s> it was the sunday evening after the event occurred that my brother and i walked over to the mount where we found the poet alone <\s>
<s> one of the first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been he said his friend for more than thirty years <\s>
<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>
<s> it appeared that his death was a relief from intense pain which however subsided at the interval of a few days before the event and that shortly after this cessation of agony he fell into a comatose state <\s>
<s> the most interesting part of the letter was the statement that the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other relatives and friends around him to give them his blessing and to express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the depth of his trust in his saviour christ <\s>
<s> as i heard this i was at once deeply glad at the substance and deeply affected by wordsworth's emotion in reading it <\s>
<s> when he came to this part his voice at first faltered and then broke but soon divine faith that the change was a blest one overcame aught of human grief and he concluded in an equable though subdued tone <\s>
<s> before i quit this subject i will tell you what i was interested in hearing from a person of the highest abilities 266 whom i had the good fortune of meeting at rydal mount <\s>
<s> he said that he had visited coleridge about a month before his death and had perceived at once his countenance pervaded by a most remarkable serenity <\s>
<s> on being congratulated on his appearance coleridge replied that he did now for the first time begin to hope from the mitigation of his pains that his health was undergoing a permanent improvement alas <\s>
<s> he was deceived yet may we not consider this hopeful feeling which is i believe by no means uncommon to be under such circumstances a valuable blessing ); but that what he felt most thankful for was the deep calm peace of mind which he then enjoyed a peace such as he had never before experienced or scarcely hoped for <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>

<s> 1874 add two items of which i retain a distinct remembrance <\s>

<s> passion in poetry one day speaking of passion as an element of poetry he referred to his own poems and said that he thought there was a stronger fire of passion than was elsewhere to be found among them in the lyrical burst near the conclusion of the song at the feast of brougham castle armour rusting in his halls on the blood of clifford calls quell the scot exclaims the lance bear me to the heart of france is the longing of the shield <\s>

<s> i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion <\s>
<s> he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual <\s>
<s> i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in after days the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element <\s>

<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>

<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>

<s> here his daily life is spent <\s>
<s> here in this room doubtless much of his poetry has been written words of power which are to go down with those of shakspeare and spenser and milton while our english tongue endures <\s>

<s> attaching a full value to the singular yet easily imagined and most picturesque circumstances of the adventurer's position to the admirable painting of the scenes and to the knowledge displayed of the working of human feelings he yet felt sure that the intense interest created by the story arose chiefly from the extraordinary energy and resource of the hero under his difficult circumstances from their being so far beyond what it was natural to expect or what would have been exhibited by the average of men and that similarly the high pleasure derived from his successes and good fortunes arose from the peculiar source of these uncommon merits of his character <\s>
<s> i have heard him pronounce that the tragedy of othello plato's records of the last scenes of the career of socrates and isaac walton's life of george herbert were in his opinion the most pathetic of human compositions <\s>
<s> in a walk one day after stopping according to his custom to claim admiration for some happy aspect of the landscape or beautiful composition on a smaller scale of natural objects caught by him at the precisely best point of view in the midst of his conversation on other subjects he added good humouredly that there were three callings for success in which nature had furnished him with qualifications the callings of poet landscape gardener and critic of pictures and works of art <\s>
<s> on hearing this i could not but remember how his qualifications for the second were proved by the surprising variety of natural beauties he managed to display to their best advantage from the very circumscribed limits of the garden at rydal mount an invisible hand of art everywhere working to use his own exquisite expression in the very spirit of nature and how many there were who have owed the charm of their grounds and gardens to direction sought from his well known taste and feeling <\s>
<s> as to works of art his criticism was not that of one versed in the history of the schools but always proceeding upon first principles the prima philosophia as he called it and it was as it appeared to me of the highest order <\s>
<s> he was a very great admirer of virgil not so much as a creative poet but as the most consummate master of language that perhaps ever existed <\s>

<s> the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth <\s>

<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>

<s> one of the first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been he said his friend for more than thirty years <\s>
<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>
<s> it appeared that his death was a relief from intense pain which however subsided at the interval of a few days before the event and that shortly after this cessation of agony he fell into a comatose state <\s>
<s> the most interesting part of the letter was the statement that the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other relatives and friends around him to give them his blessing and to express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the depth of his trust in his saviour christ <\s>
<s> as i heard this i was at once deeply glad at the substance and deeply affected by wordsworth's emotion in reading it <\s>

<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>

<s> i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion <\s>
<s> he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual <\s>
<s> i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in after days the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element <\s>

<s> in the first stanza for where'er these casual eyes are cast which he objected to as not simple and natural and as scarcely correct he suggested where'er a casual look i cast and for converse the accent of which he condemned as belonging to the noun and not to the verb he suggested commune <\s>

<s> but to some others of southey's verses as well as to the lines above quoted and to his prose writings in general he was wont to give liberal praise and no one could doubt the sincerity and warmth of his admiration of the intellect and virtues of the man or the brotherly affection towards him which he not unfrequently expressed <\s>

<s> feeling very grateful to you for the pleasure which that visit gave me and desiring to make a more minute record of it than either the letter i addressed to you from keswick or my journal written at the time contains i gladly comply with your request <\s>
<s> it was about noon on the 18th of august 1849 that i set out with my friends from their house near bowness to ride to ambleside <\s>
<s> our route was along the shore of lake windermere <\s>
<s> it was my first day among the english lakes and i enjoyed keenly the loveliness which was spread out before me <\s>
<s> my friends congratulated me on the clearness of the atmosphere and the bright skies <\s>
<s> twilight is all important in bringing out the full beauty of the lake region and in this respect i was very fortunate <\s>
<s> i had already been deeply moved by the tranquil beauty of windermere for as i came out of the cottage formerly professor wilson's where i had passed the night there it lay in all its grandeur its clear waters its green islands and its girdle of solemn mountains <\s>
<s> it was quite dark when i had been conducted to this cottage the night before so that i saw the lake for the first time in the light of early morning <\s>
<s> the first impression was confirmed by every new prospect as we rode along <\s>
<s> the vale seemed a very paradise for its sweet seclusion <\s>
<s> i had been told that after switzerland i should find little to attract me in this region but such was not the case <\s>
<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>
<s> the foliage is of the darkest green giving to the lake in which it is reflected the same sombre hue <\s>
<s> it seemed the fittest dwelling place for a poet amid all this quiet beauty <\s>
<s> it was half past one when we reached ambleside where i left mr <\s>
<s> b and walked on alone to rydal mount <\s>
<s> i was full of eager expectations as i thought how soon i should perhaps be in the presence of wordsworth that after long years of waiting of distant reverential admiration and love i was as i hoped to be favoured with a personal interview with the great poet philosopher to whom you and i and so many many others feel that we are under the deepest obligation for the good which has come to us from his writings <\s>
<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>
<s> i walked along the gravel pathway leading through shrubbery to the open space in front of the long two story cottage the poet's dwelling <\s>
<s> your sketch of the house by inman is a correct one but it gives no idea of the view from it which is its chief charm <\s>
<s> rydal mere with its islands and the mountains beyond it are all in sight <\s>

<s> it was evident that the greatest attention had been paid to the grounds for the flower beds were tastefully arranged and the gravel walks were in complete order <\s>
<s> one might be well content i thought to make his abode at a spot like this <\s>

<s> my dear friend you have asked me to write out as fully as i can an account of my visit to wordsworth last summer of which your letter of introduction was the occasion <\s>
<s> feeling very grateful to you for the pleasure which that visit gave me and desiring to make a more minute record of it than either the letter i addressed to you from keswick or my journal written at the time contains i gladly comply with your request <\s>
<s> it was about noon on the 18th of august 1849 that i set out with my friends from their house near bowness to ride to ambleside <\s>
<s> our route was along the shore of lake windermere <\s>
<s> it was my first day among the english lakes and i enjoyed keenly the loveliness which was spread out before me <\s>
<s> my friends congratulated me on the clearness of the atmosphere and the bright skies <\s>
<s> twilight is all important in bringing out the full beauty of the lake region and in this respect i was very fortunate <\s>
<s> i had already been deeply moved by the tranquil beauty of windermere for as i came out of the cottage formerly professor wilson's where i had passed the night there it lay in all its grandeur its clear waters its green islands and its girdle of solemn mountains <\s>
<s> it was quite dark when i had been conducted to this cottage the night before so that i saw the lake for the first time in the light of early morning <\s>
<s> the first impression was confirmed by every new prospect as we rode along <\s>
<s> the vale seemed a very paradise for its sweet seclusion <\s>
<s> i had been told that after switzerland i should find little to attract me in this region but such was not the case <\s>
<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>
<s> the foliage is of the darkest green giving to the lake in which it is reflected the same sombre hue <\s>
<s> it seemed the fittest dwelling place for a poet amid all this quiet beauty <\s>
<s> it was half past one when we reached ambleside where i left mr <\s>
<s> b and walked on alone to rydal mount <\s>
<s> i was full of eager expectations as i thought how soon i should perhaps be in the presence of wordsworth that after long years of waiting of distant reverential admiration and love i was as i hoped to be favoured with a personal interview with the great poet philosopher to whom you and i and so many many others feel that we are under the deepest obligation for the good which has come to us from his writings <\s>
<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>
<s> i walked along the gravel pathway leading through shrubbery to the open space in front of the long two story cottage the poet's dwelling <\s>
<s> your sketch of the house by inman is a correct one but it gives no idea of the view from it which is its chief charm <\s>
<s> rydal mere with its islands and the mountains beyond it are all in sight <\s>
<s> i had but a hasty enjoyment of this beauty nor could i notice carefully the flowers which were blooming around <\s>
<s> it was evident that the greatest attention had been paid to the grounds for the flower beds were tastefully arranged and the gravel walks were in complete order <\s>
<s> one might be well content i thought to make his abode at a spot like this <\s>
<s> a boy of about twelve years was occupied at one of the flower beds as i passed by he followed me to the door and waited my commands <\s>
<s> i asked if mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth was in .... <\s>
<s> he was dining would i walk into the drawing room and wait a short time ... <\s>
<s> i was shown into the drawing room or study i know not which to call it .... <\s>
<s> here i am i said to myself in the great poet's house <\s>
<s> here his daily life is spent <\s>
<s> here in this room doubtless much of his poetry has been written words of power which are to go down with those of shakspeare and spenser and milton while our english tongue endures <\s>
<s> it was a long apartment the ceiling low with two windows at one end looking out on the lawn and shrubbery <\s>
<s> many engravings were on the walls <\s>
<s> the famous madonna of raphael known as that of the dresden gallery hung directly over the fire place <\s>
<s> attaching a full value to the singular yet easily imagined and most picturesque circumstances of the adventurer's position to the admirable painting of the scenes and to the knowledge displayed of the working of human feelings he yet felt sure that the intense interest created by the story arose chiefly from the extraordinary energy and resource of the hero under his difficult circumstances from their being so far beyond what it was natural to expect or what would have been exhibited by the average of men and that similarly the high pleasure derived from his successes and good fortunes arose from the peculiar source of these uncommon merits of his character <\s>
<s> i have heard him pronounce that the tragedy of othello plato's records of the last scenes of the career of socrates and isaac walton's life of george herbert were in his opinion the most pathetic of human compositions <\s>
<s> in a walk one day after stopping according to his custom to claim admiration for some happy aspect of the landscape or beautiful composition on a smaller scale of natural objects caught by him at the precisely best point of view in the midst of his conversation on other subjects he added good humouredly that there were three callings for success in which nature had furnished him with qualifications the callings of poet landscape gardener and critic of pictures and works of art <\s>
<s> on hearing this i could not but remember how his qualifications for the second were proved by the surprising variety of natural beauties he managed to display to their best advantage from the very circumscribed limits of the garden at rydal mount an invisible hand of art everywhere working to use his own exquisite expression in the very spirit of nature and how many there were who have owed the charm of their grounds and gardens to direction sought from his well known taste and feeling <\s>
<s> as to works of art his criticism was not that of one versed in the history of the schools but always proceeding upon first principles the prima philosophia as he called it and it was as it appeared to me of the highest order <\s>

<s> g on the death of coleridge <\s>
<s> the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth <\s>
<s> it was the sunday evening after the event occurred that my brother and i walked over to the mount where we found the poet alone <\s>
<s> one of the first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been he said his friend for more than thirty years <\s>
<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>
<s> it appeared that his death was a relief from intense pain which however subsided at the interval of a few days before the event and that shortly after this cessation of agony he fell into a comatose state <\s>
<s> the most interesting part of the letter was the statement that the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other relatives and friends around him to give them his blessing and to express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the depth of his trust in his saviour christ <\s>
<s> as i heard this i was at once deeply glad at the substance and deeply affected by wordsworth's emotion in reading it <\s>
<s> when he came to this part his voice at first faltered and then broke but soon divine faith that the change was a blest one overcame aught of human grief and he concluded in an equable though subdued tone <\s>
<s> before i quit this subject i will tell you what i was interested in hearing from a person of the highest abilities 266 whom i had the good fortune of meeting at rydal mount <\s>
<s> he said that he had visited coleridge about a month before his death and had perceived at once his countenance pervaded by a most remarkable serenity <\s>
<s> on being congratulated on his appearance coleridge replied that he did now for the first time begin to hope from the mitigation of his pains that his health was undergoing a permanent improvement alas <\s>
<s> he was deceived yet may we not consider this hopeful feeling which is i believe by no means uncommon to be under such circumstances a valuable blessing ); but that what he felt most thankful for was the deep calm peace of mind which he then enjoyed a peace such as he had never before experienced or scarcely hoped for <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>
<s> to the above memorandum i now sept <\s>
<s> 1874 add two items of which i retain a distinct remembrance <\s>
<s> 1 he was in favour of the officiating clergyman being allowed to introduce into his reading of the lessons in church the authorised marginal corrections <\s>
<s> 2 he expressed in very strong terms his opinion that the prefatory portion of the marriage service should be altered so as to make it not only less repulsive to modern feelings but more accordant with the higher aspects of the union to be solemnised <\s>
<s> passion in poetry one day speaking of passion as an element of poetry he referred to his own poems and said that he thought there was a stronger fire of passion than was elsewhere to be found among them in the lyrical burst near the conclusion of the song at the feast of brougham castle armour rusting in his halls on the blood of clifford calls quell the scot exclaims the lance bear me to the heart of france is the longing of the shield <\s>
<s> chronological classification of poems many years ago i expressed to wordsworth a wish that his poems were printed in the order of their composition assigning as reasons for the wish the great interest which would attach to observing the progressive development of the poet's thought and the interpretative value of the light mutually reflected by poems of the same period <\s>
<s> i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion <\s>
<s> he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual <\s>
<s> i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in after days the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element <\s>
<s> verbal criticism wordsworth not only sympathised with the feelings expressed in southey's touching lines upon the dead but admired very much the easy flow of the verse and the perfect freedom from strain in the expression by which they are marked <\s>
<s> yet in the first two stanzas he noted three flaws and suggested changes by which they might have been easily avoided <\s>
<s> i have underlined the words he took exception to my days among the dead are past around me i behold where'er these casual eyes are cast the mighty minds of old my never failing friends are they with whom i converse day by day <\s>
<s> with them i take delight in weal and seek relief in woe and while i understand and feel how much to them i owe my cheeks have often been bedew'd with tears of thoughtful gratitude <\s>
<s> in the first stanza for where'er these casual eyes are cast which he objected to as not simple and natural and as scarcely correct he suggested where'er a casual look i cast and for converse the accent of which he condemned as belonging to the noun and not to the verb he suggested commune <\s>
<s> in the second stanza he pointed out the improper sequence of tenses in the third and fifth lines which he corrected by reading in the latter my cheeks are oftentimes bedew'd <\s>
<s> of the narrative poems of his friend well executed as he considered them and of the mainly external action of imagination or fancy in which they deal i have certainly heard him pronounce a very depreciatory opinion whether i ever heard him use the hard words attributed to him i would not give five shillings for a ream of them i cannot now assert but if used they were said in reference to the nobler kind of imaginative power which reveals to man the deep places and sublimer affinities of his own being <\s>
<s> but to some others of southey's verses as well as to the lines above quoted and to his prose writings in general he was wont to give liberal praise and no one could doubt the sincerity and warmth of his admiration of the intellect and virtues of the man or the brotherly affection towards him which he not unfrequently expressed <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>

<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>

<s> the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth <\s>
<s> it was the sunday evening after the event occurred that my brother and i walked over to the mount where we found the poet alone <\s>
<s> one of the first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been he said his friend for more than thirty years <\s>
<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>
<s> it appeared that his death was a relief from intense pain which however subsided at the interval of a few days before the event and that shortly after this cessation of agony he fell into a comatose state <\s>
<s> the most interesting part of the letter was the statement that the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other relatives and friends around him to give them his blessing and to express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the depth of his trust in his saviour christ <\s>
<s> as i heard this i was at once deeply glad at the substance and deeply affected by wordsworth's emotion in reading it <\s>
<s> when he came to this part his voice at first faltered and then broke but soon divine faith that the change was a blest one overcame aught of human grief and he concluded in an equable though subdued tone <\s>
<s> before i quit this subject i will tell you what i was interested in hearing from a person of the highest abilities 266 whom i had the good fortune of meeting at rydal mount <\s>
<s> he said that he had visited coleridge about a month before his death and had perceived at once his countenance pervaded by a most remarkable serenity <\s>
<s> on being congratulated on his appearance coleridge replied that he did now for the first time begin to hope from the mitigation of his pains that his health was undergoing a permanent improvement alas <\s>
<s> he was deceived yet may we not consider this hopeful feeling which is i believe by no means uncommon to be under such circumstances a valuable blessing ); but that what he felt most thankful for was the deep calm peace of mind which he then enjoyed a peace such as he had never before experienced or scarcely hoped for <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>

<s> 1874 add two items of which i retain a distinct remembrance <\s>

<s> passion in poetry one day speaking of passion as an element of poetry he referred to his own poems and said that he thought there was a stronger fire of passion than was elsewhere to be found among them in the lyrical burst near the conclusion of the song at the feast of brougham castle armour rusting in his halls on the blood of clifford calls quell the scot exclaims the lance bear me to the heart of france is the longing of the shield <\s>

<s> i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion <\s>
<s> he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual <\s>
<s> i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in after days the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element <\s>

<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>

<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>

<s> here his daily life is spent <\s>
<s> here in this room doubtless much of his poetry has been written words of power which are to go down with those of shakspeare and spenser and milton while our english tongue endures <\s>

<s> attaching a full value to the singular yet easily imagined and most picturesque circumstances of the adventurer's position to the admirable painting of the scenes and to the knowledge displayed of the working of human feelings he yet felt sure that the intense interest created by the story arose chiefly from the extraordinary energy and resource of the hero under his difficult circumstances from their being so far beyond what it was natural to expect or what would have been exhibited by the average of men and that similarly the high pleasure derived from his successes and good fortunes arose from the peculiar source of these uncommon merits of his character <\s>
<s> i have heard him pronounce that the tragedy of othello plato's records of the last scenes of the career of socrates and isaac walton's life of george herbert were in his opinion the most pathetic of human compositions <\s>
<s> in a walk one day after stopping according to his custom to claim admiration for some happy aspect of the landscape or beautiful composition on a smaller scale of natural objects caught by him at the precisely best point of view in the midst of his conversation on other subjects he added good humouredly that there were three callings for success in which nature had furnished him with qualifications the callings of poet landscape gardener and critic of pictures and works of art <\s>
<s> on hearing this i could not but remember how his qualifications for the second were proved by the surprising variety of natural beauties he managed to display to their best advantage from the very circumscribed limits of the garden at rydal mount an invisible hand of art everywhere working to use his own exquisite expression in the very spirit of nature and how many there were who have owed the charm of their grounds and gardens to direction sought from his well known taste and feeling <\s>
<s> as to works of art his criticism was not that of one versed in the history of the schools but always proceeding upon first principles the prima philosophia as he called it and it was as it appeared to me of the highest order <\s>
<s> he was a very great admirer of virgil not so much as a creative poet but as the most consummate master of language that perhaps ever existed <\s>

<s> the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth <\s>

<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>

<s> one of the first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been he said his friend for more than thirty years <\s>
<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>
<s> it appeared that his death was a relief from intense pain which however subsided at the interval of a few days before the event and that shortly after this cessation of agony he fell into a comatose state <\s>
<s> the most interesting part of the letter was the statement that the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other relatives and friends around him to give them his blessing and to express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the depth of his trust in his saviour christ <\s>
<s> as i heard this i was at once deeply glad at the substance and deeply affected by wordsworth's emotion in reading it <\s>

<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>

<s> i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion <\s>
<s> he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual <\s>
<s> i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in after days the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element <\s>

<s> in the first stanza for where'er these casual eyes are cast which he objected to as not simple and natural and as scarcely correct he suggested where'er a casual look i cast and for converse the accent of which he condemned as belonging to the noun and not to the verb he suggested commune <\s>

<s> but to some others of southey's verses as well as to the lines above quoted and to his prose writings in general he was wont to give liberal praise and no one could doubt the sincerity and warmth of his admiration of the intellect and virtues of the man or the brotherly affection towards him which he not unfrequently expressed <\s>

<s> feeling very grateful to you for the pleasure which that visit gave me and desiring to make a more minute record of it than either the letter i addressed to you from keswick or my journal written at the time contains i gladly comply with your request <\s>
<s> it was about noon on the 18th of august 1849 that i set out with my friends from their house near bowness to ride to ambleside <\s>
<s> our route was along the shore of lake windermere <\s>
<s> it was my first day among the english lakes and i enjoyed keenly the loveliness which was spread out before me <\s>
<s> my friends congratulated me on the clearness of the atmosphere and the bright skies <\s>
<s> twilight is all important in bringing out the full beauty of the lake region and in this respect i was very fortunate <\s>
<s> i had already been deeply moved by the tranquil beauty of windermere for as i came out of the cottage formerly professor wilson's where i had passed the night there it lay in all its grandeur its clear waters its green islands and its girdle of solemn mountains <\s>
<s> it was quite dark when i had been conducted to this cottage the night before so that i saw the lake for the first time in the light of early morning <\s>
<s> the first impression was confirmed by every new prospect as we rode along <\s>
<s> the vale seemed a very paradise for its sweet seclusion <\s>
<s> i had been told that after switzerland i should find little to attract me in this region but such was not the case <\s>
<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>
<s> the foliage is of the darkest green giving to the lake in which it is reflected the same sombre hue <\s>
<s> it seemed the fittest dwelling place for a poet amid all this quiet beauty <\s>
<s> it was half past one when we reached ambleside where i left mr <\s>
<s> b and walked on alone to rydal mount <\s>
<s> i was full of eager expectations as i thought how soon i should perhaps be in the presence of wordsworth that after long years of waiting of distant reverential admiration and love i was as i hoped to be favoured with a personal interview with the great poet philosopher to whom you and i and so many many others feel that we are under the deepest obligation for the good which has come to us from his writings <\s>
<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>
<s> i walked along the gravel pathway leading through shrubbery to the open space in front of the long two story cottage the poet's dwelling <\s>
<s> your sketch of the house by inman is a correct one but it gives no idea of the view from it which is its chief charm <\s>
<s> rydal mere with its islands and the mountains beyond it are all in sight <\s>

<s> it was evident that the greatest attention had been paid to the grounds for the flower beds were tastefully arranged and the gravel walks were in complete order <\s>
<s> one might be well content i thought to make his abode at a spot like this <\s>

<s> my dear friend you have asked me to write out as fully as i can an account of my visit to wordsworth last summer of which your letter of introduction was the occasion <\s>
<s> feeling very grateful to you for the pleasure which that visit gave me and desiring to make a more minute record of it than either the letter i addressed to you from keswick or my journal written at the time contains i gladly comply with your request <\s>
<s> it was about noon on the 18th of august 1849 that i set out with my friends from their house near bowness to ride to ambleside <\s>
<s> our route was along the shore of lake windermere <\s>
<s> it was my first day among the english lakes and i enjoyed keenly the loveliness which was spread out before me <\s>
<s> my friends congratulated me on the clearness of the atmosphere and the bright skies <\s>
<s> twilight is all important in bringing out the full beauty of the lake region and in this respect i was very fortunate <\s>
<s> i had already been deeply moved by the tranquil beauty of windermere for as i came out of the cottage formerly professor wilson's where i had passed the night there it lay in all its grandeur its clear waters its green islands and its girdle of solemn mountains <\s>
<s> it was quite dark when i had been conducted to this cottage the night before so that i saw the lake for the first time in the light of early morning <\s>
<s> the first impression was confirmed by every new prospect as we rode along <\s>
<s> the vale seemed a very paradise for its sweet seclusion <\s>
<s> i had been told that after switzerland i should find little to attract me in this region but such was not the case <\s>
<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>
<s> the foliage is of the darkest green giving to the lake in which it is reflected the same sombre hue <\s>
<s> it seemed the fittest dwelling place for a poet amid all this quiet beauty <\s>
<s> it was half past one when we reached ambleside where i left mr <\s>
<s> b and walked on alone to rydal mount <\s>
<s> i was full of eager expectations as i thought how soon i should perhaps be in the presence of wordsworth that after long years of waiting of distant reverential admiration and love i was as i hoped to be favoured with a personal interview with the great poet philosopher to whom you and i and so many many others feel that we are under the deepest obligation for the good which has come to us from his writings <\s>
<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>
<s> i walked along the gravel pathway leading through shrubbery to the open space in front of the long two story cottage the poet's dwelling <\s>
<s> your sketch of the house by inman is a correct one but it gives no idea of the view from it which is its chief charm <\s>
<s> rydal mere with its islands and the mountains beyond it are all in sight <\s>
<s> i had but a hasty enjoyment of this beauty nor could i notice carefully the flowers which were blooming around <\s>
<s> it was evident that the greatest attention had been paid to the grounds for the flower beds were tastefully arranged and the gravel walks were in complete order <\s>
<s> one might be well content i thought to make his abode at a spot like this <\s>
<s> a boy of about twelve years was occupied at one of the flower beds as i passed by he followed me to the door and waited my commands <\s>
<s> i asked if mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth was in .... <\s>
<s> he was dining would i walk into the drawing room and wait a short time ... <\s>
<s> i was shown into the drawing room or study i know not which to call it .... <\s>
<s> here i am i said to myself in the great poet's house <\s>
<s> here his daily life is spent <\s>
<s> here in this room doubtless much of his poetry has been written words of power which are to go down with those of shakspeare and spenser and milton while our english tongue endures <\s>
<s> it was a long apartment the ceiling low with two windows at one end looking out on the lawn and shrubbery <\s>
<s> many engravings were on the walls <\s>
<s> the famous madonna of raphael known as that of the dresden gallery hung directly over the fire place <\s>
<s> attaching a full value to the singular yet easily imagined and most picturesque circumstances of the adventurer's position to the admirable painting of the scenes and to the knowledge displayed of the working of human feelings he yet felt sure that the intense interest created by the story arose chiefly from the extraordinary energy and resource of the hero under his difficult circumstances from their being so far beyond what it was natural to expect or what would have been exhibited by the average of men and that similarly the high pleasure derived from his successes and good fortunes arose from the peculiar source of these uncommon merits of his character <\s>
<s> i have heard him pronounce that the tragedy of othello plato's records of the last scenes of the career of socrates and isaac walton's life of george herbert were in his opinion the most pathetic of human compositions <\s>
<s> in a walk one day after stopping according to his custom to claim admiration for some happy aspect of the landscape or beautiful composition on a smaller scale of natural objects caught by him at the precisely best point of view in the midst of his conversation on other subjects he added good humouredly that there were three callings for success in which nature had furnished him with qualifications the callings of poet landscape gardener and critic of pictures and works of art <\s>
<s> on hearing this i could not but remember how his qualifications for the second were proved by the surprising variety of natural beauties he managed to display to their best advantage from the very circumscribed limits of the garden at rydal mount an invisible hand of art everywhere working to use his own exquisite expression in the very spirit of nature and how many there were who have owed the charm of their grounds and gardens to direction sought from his well known taste and feeling <\s>
<s> as to works of art his criticism was not that of one versed in the history of the schools but always proceeding upon first principles the prima philosophia as he called it and it was as it appeared to me of the highest order <\s>

<s> g on the death of coleridge <\s>
<s> the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth <\s>
<s> it was the sunday evening after the event occurred that my brother and i walked over to the mount where we found the poet alone <\s>
<s> one of the first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been he said his friend for more than thirty years <\s>
<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>
<s> it appeared that his death was a relief from intense pain which however subsided at the interval of a few days before the event and that shortly after this cessation of agony he fell into a comatose state <\s>
<s> the most interesting part of the letter was the statement that the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other relatives and friends around him to give them his blessing and to express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the depth of his trust in his saviour christ <\s>
<s> as i heard this i was at once deeply glad at the substance and deeply affected by wordsworth's emotion in reading it <\s>
<s> when he came to this part his voice at first faltered and then broke but soon divine faith that the change was a blest one overcame aught of human grief and he concluded in an equable though subdued tone <\s>
<s> before i quit this subject i will tell you what i was interested in hearing from a person of the highest abilities 266 whom i had the good fortune of meeting at rydal mount <\s>
<s> he said that he had visited coleridge about a month before his death and had perceived at once his countenance pervaded by a most remarkable serenity <\s>
<s> on being congratulated on his appearance coleridge replied that he did now for the first time begin to hope from the mitigation of his pains that his health was undergoing a permanent improvement alas <\s>
<s> he was deceived yet may we not consider this hopeful feeling which is i believe by no means uncommon to be under such circumstances a valuable blessing ); but that what he felt most thankful for was the deep calm peace of mind which he then enjoyed a peace such as he had never before experienced or scarcely hoped for <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>
<s> to the above memorandum i now sept <\s>
<s> 1874 add two items of which i retain a distinct remembrance <\s>
<s> 1 he was in favour of the officiating clergyman being allowed to introduce into his reading of the lessons in church the authorised marginal corrections <\s>
<s> 2 he expressed in very strong terms his opinion that the prefatory portion of the marriage service should be altered so as to make it not only less repulsive to modern feelings but more accordant with the higher aspects of the union to be solemnised <\s>
<s> passion in poetry one day speaking of passion as an element of poetry he referred to his own poems and said that he thought there was a stronger fire of passion than was elsewhere to be found among them in the lyrical burst near the conclusion of the song at the feast of brougham castle armour rusting in his halls on the blood of clifford calls quell the scot exclaims the lance bear me to the heart of france is the longing of the shield <\s>
<s> chronological classification of poems many years ago i expressed to wordsworth a wish that his poems were printed in the order of their composition assigning as reasons for the wish the great interest which would attach to observing the progressive development of the poet's thought and the interpretative value of the light mutually reflected by poems of the same period <\s>
<s> i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion <\s>
<s> he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual <\s>
<s> i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in after days the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element <\s>
<s> verbal criticism wordsworth not only sympathised with the feelings expressed in southey's touching lines upon the dead but admired very much the easy flow of the verse and the perfect freedom from strain in the expression by which they are marked <\s>
<s> yet in the first two stanzas he noted three flaws and suggested changes by which they might have been easily avoided <\s>
<s> i have underlined the words he took exception to my days among the dead are past around me i behold where'er these casual eyes are cast the mighty minds of old my never failing friends are they with whom i converse day by day <\s>
<s> with them i take delight in weal and seek relief in woe and while i understand and feel how much to them i owe my cheeks have often been bedew'd with tears of thoughtful gratitude <\s>
<s> in the first stanza for where'er these casual eyes are cast which he objected to as not simple and natural and as scarcely correct he suggested where'er a casual look i cast and for converse the accent of which he condemned as belonging to the noun and not to the verb he suggested commune <\s>
<s> in the second stanza he pointed out the improper sequence of tenses in the third and fifth lines which he corrected by reading in the latter my cheeks are oftentimes bedew'd <\s>
<s> of the narrative poems of his friend well executed as he considered them and of the mainly external action of imagination or fancy in which they deal i have certainly heard him pronounce a very depreciatory opinion whether i ever heard him use the hard words attributed to him i would not give five shillings for a ream of them i cannot now assert but if used they were said in reference to the nobler kind of imaginative power which reveals to man the deep places and sublimer affinities of his own being <\s>
<s> but to some others of southey's verses as well as to the lines above quoted and to his prose writings in general he was wont to give liberal praise and no one could doubt the sincerity and warmth of his admiration of the intellect and virtues of the man or the brotherly affection towards him which he not unfrequently expressed <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>

<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>

<s> the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth <\s>
<s> it was the sunday evening after the event occurred that my brother and i walked over to the mount where we found the poet alone <\s>
<s> one of the first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been he said his friend for more than thirty years <\s>
<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>
<s> it appeared that his death was a relief from intense pain which however subsided at the interval of a few days before the event and that shortly after this cessation of agony he fell into a comatose state <\s>
<s> the most interesting part of the letter was the statement that the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other relatives and friends around him to give them his blessing and to express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the depth of his trust in his saviour christ <\s>
<s> as i heard this i was at once deeply glad at the substance and deeply affected by wordsworth's emotion in reading it <\s>
<s> when he came to this part his voice at first faltered and then broke but soon divine faith that the change was a blest one overcame aught of human grief and he concluded in an equable though subdued tone <\s>
<s> before i quit this subject i will tell you what i was interested in hearing from a person of the highest abilities 266 whom i had the good fortune of meeting at rydal mount <\s>
<s> he said that he had visited coleridge about a month before his death and had perceived at once his countenance pervaded by a most remarkable serenity <\s>
<s> on being congratulated on his appearance coleridge replied that he did now for the first time begin to hope from the mitigation of his pains that his health was undergoing a permanent improvement alas <\s>
<s> he was deceived yet may we not consider this hopeful feeling which is i believe by no means uncommon to be under such circumstances a valuable blessing ); but that what he felt most thankful for was the deep calm peace of mind which he then enjoyed a peace such as he had never before experienced or scarcely hoped for <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>

<s> 1874 add two items of which i retain a distinct remembrance <\s>

<s> passion in poetry one day speaking of passion as an element of poetry he referred to his own poems and said that he thought there was a stronger fire of passion than was elsewhere to be found among them in the lyrical burst near the conclusion of the song at the feast of brougham castle armour rusting in his halls on the blood of clifford calls quell the scot exclaims the lance bear me to the heart of france is the longing of the shield <\s>

<s> i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion <\s>
<s> he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual <\s>
<s> i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in after days the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element <\s>

<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>

<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>

<s> here his daily life is spent <\s>
<s> here in this room doubtless much of his poetry has been written words of power which are to go down with those of shakspeare and spenser and milton while our english tongue endures <\s>

<s> attaching a full value to the singular yet easily imagined and most picturesque circumstances of the adventurer's position to the admirable painting of the scenes and to the knowledge displayed of the working of human feelings he yet felt sure that the intense interest created by the story arose chiefly from the extraordinary energy and resource of the hero under his difficult circumstances from their being so far beyond what it was natural to expect or what would have been exhibited by the average of men and that similarly the high pleasure derived from his successes and good fortunes arose from the peculiar source of these uncommon merits of his character <\s>
<s> i have heard him pronounce that the tragedy of othello plato's records of the last scenes of the career of socrates and isaac walton's life of george herbert were in his opinion the most pathetic of human compositions <\s>
<s> in a walk one day after stopping according to his custom to claim admiration for some happy aspect of the landscape or beautiful composition on a smaller scale of natural objects caught by him at the precisely best point of view in the midst of his conversation on other subjects he added good humouredly that there were three callings for success in which nature had furnished him with qualifications the callings of poet landscape gardener and critic of pictures and works of art <\s>
<s> on hearing this i could not but remember how his qualifications for the second were proved by the surprising variety of natural beauties he managed to display to their best advantage from the very circumscribed limits of the garden at rydal mount an invisible hand of art everywhere working to use his own exquisite expression in the very spirit of nature and how many there were who have owed the charm of their grounds and gardens to direction sought from his well known taste and feeling <\s>
<s> as to works of art his criticism was not that of one versed in the history of the schools but always proceeding upon first principles the prima philosophia as he called it and it was as it appeared to me of the highest order <\s>
<s> he was a very great admirer of virgil not so much as a creative poet but as the most consummate master of language that perhaps ever existed <\s>

<s> the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth <\s>

<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>

<s> one of the first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been he said his friend for more than thirty years <\s>
<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>
<s> it appeared that his death was a relief from intense pain which however subsided at the interval of a few days before the event and that shortly after this cessation of agony he fell into a comatose state <\s>
<s> the most interesting part of the letter was the statement that the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other relatives and friends around him to give them his blessing and to express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the depth of his trust in his saviour christ <\s>
<s> as i heard this i was at once deeply glad at the substance and deeply affected by wordsworth's emotion in reading it <\s>

<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>

<s> i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion <\s>
<s> he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual <\s>
<s> i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in after days the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element <\s>

<s> in the first stanza for where'er these casual eyes are cast which he objected to as not simple and natural and as scarcely correct he suggested where'er a casual look i cast and for converse the accent of which he condemned as belonging to the noun and not to the verb he suggested commune <\s>

<s> but to some others of southey's verses as well as to the lines above quoted and to his prose writings in general he was wont to give liberal praise and no one could doubt the sincerity and warmth of his admiration of the intellect and virtues of the man or the brotherly affection towards him which he not unfrequently expressed <\s>

<s> feeling very grateful to you for the pleasure which that visit gave me and desiring to make a more minute record of it than either the letter i addressed to you from keswick or my journal written at the time contains i gladly comply with your request <\s>
<s> it was about noon on the 18th of august 1849 that i set out with my friends from their house near bowness to ride to ambleside <\s>
<s> our route was along the shore of lake windermere <\s>
<s> it was my first day among the english lakes and i enjoyed keenly the loveliness which was spread out before me <\s>
<s> my friends congratulated me on the clearness of the atmosphere and the bright skies <\s>
<s> twilight is all important in bringing out the full beauty of the lake region and in this respect i was very fortunate <\s>
<s> i had already been deeply moved by the tranquil beauty of windermere for as i came out of the cottage formerly professor wilson's where i had passed the night there it lay in all its grandeur its clear waters its green islands and its girdle of solemn mountains <\s>
<s> it was quite dark when i had been conducted to this cottage the night before so that i saw the lake for the first time in the light of early morning <\s>
<s> the first impression was confirmed by every new prospect as we rode along <\s>
<s> the vale seemed a very paradise for its sweet seclusion <\s>
<s> i had been told that after switzerland i should find little to attract me in this region but such was not the case <\s>
<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>
<s> the foliage is of the darkest green giving to the lake in which it is reflected the same sombre hue <\s>
<s> it seemed the fittest dwelling place for a poet amid all this quiet beauty <\s>
<s> it was half past one when we reached ambleside where i left mr <\s>
<s> b and walked on alone to rydal mount <\s>
<s> i was full of eager expectations as i thought how soon i should perhaps be in the presence of wordsworth that after long years of waiting of distant reverential admiration and love i was as i hoped to be favoured with a personal interview with the great poet philosopher to whom you and i and so many many others feel that we are under the deepest obligation for the good which has come to us from his writings <\s>
<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>
<s> i walked along the gravel pathway leading through shrubbery to the open space in front of the long two story cottage the poet's dwelling <\s>
<s> your sketch of the house by inman is a correct one but it gives no idea of the view from it which is its chief charm <\s>
<s> rydal mere with its islands and the mountains beyond it are all in sight <\s>

<s> it was evident that the greatest attention had been paid to the grounds for the flower beds were tastefully arranged and the gravel walks were in complete order <\s>
<s> one might be well content i thought to make his abode at a spot like this <\s>

<s> my dear friend you have asked me to write out as fully as i can an account of my visit to wordsworth last summer of which your letter of introduction was the occasion <\s>
<s> feeling very grateful to you for the pleasure which that visit gave me and desiring to make a more minute record of it than either the letter i addressed to you from keswick or my journal written at the time contains i gladly comply with your request <\s>
<s> it was about noon on the 18th of august 1849 that i set out with my friends from their house near bowness to ride to ambleside <\s>
<s> our route was along the shore of lake windermere <\s>
<s> it was my first day among the english lakes and i enjoyed keenly the loveliness which was spread out before me <\s>
<s> my friends congratulated me on the clearness of the atmosphere and the bright skies <\s>
<s> twilight is all important in bringing out the full beauty of the lake region and in this respect i was very fortunate <\s>
<s> i had already been deeply moved by the tranquil beauty of windermere for as i came out of the cottage formerly professor wilson's where i had passed the night there it lay in all its grandeur its clear waters its green islands and its girdle of solemn mountains <\s>
<s> it was quite dark when i had been conducted to this cottage the night before so that i saw the lake for the first time in the light of early morning <\s>
<s> the first impression was confirmed by every new prospect as we rode along <\s>
<s> the vale seemed a very paradise for its sweet seclusion <\s>
<s> i had been told that after switzerland i should find little to attract me in this region but such was not the case <\s>
<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>
<s> the foliage is of the darkest green giving to the lake in which it is reflected the same sombre hue <\s>
<s> it seemed the fittest dwelling place for a poet amid all this quiet beauty <\s>
<s> it was half past one when we reached ambleside where i left mr <\s>
<s> b and walked on alone to rydal mount <\s>
<s> i was full of eager expectations as i thought how soon i should perhaps be in the presence of wordsworth that after long years of waiting of distant reverential admiration and love i was as i hoped to be favoured with a personal interview with the great poet philosopher to whom you and i and so many many others feel that we are under the deepest obligation for the good which has come to us from his writings <\s>
<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>
<s> i walked along the gravel pathway leading through shrubbery to the open space in front of the long two story cottage the poet's dwelling <\s>
<s> your sketch of the house by inman is a correct one but it gives no idea of the view from it which is its chief charm <\s>
<s> rydal mere with its islands and the mountains beyond it are all in sight <\s>
<s> i had but a hasty enjoyment of this beauty nor could i notice carefully the flowers which were blooming around <\s>
<s> it was evident that the greatest attention had been paid to the grounds for the flower beds were tastefully arranged and the gravel walks were in complete order <\s>
<s> one might be well content i thought to make his abode at a spot like this <\s>
<s> a boy of about twelve years was occupied at one of the flower beds as i passed by he followed me to the door and waited my commands <\s>
<s> i asked if mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth was in .... <\s>
<s> he was dining would i walk into the drawing room and wait a short time ... <\s>
<s> i was shown into the drawing room or study i know not which to call it .... <\s>
<s> here i am i said to myself in the great poet's house <\s>
<s> here his daily life is spent <\s>
<s> here in this room doubtless much of his poetry has been written words of power which are to go down with those of shakspeare and spenser and milton while our english tongue endures <\s>
<s> it was a long apartment the ceiling low with two windows at one end looking out on the lawn and shrubbery <\s>
<s> many engravings were on the walls <\s>
<s> the famous madonna of raphael known as that of the dresden gallery hung directly over the fire place <\s>
<s> attaching a full value to the singular yet easily imagined and most picturesque circumstances of the adventurer's position to the admirable painting of the scenes and to the knowledge displayed of the working of human feelings he yet felt sure that the intense interest created by the story arose chiefly from the extraordinary energy and resource of the hero under his difficult circumstances from their being so far beyond what it was natural to expect or what would have been exhibited by the average of men and that similarly the high pleasure derived from his successes and good fortunes arose from the peculiar source of these uncommon merits of his character <\s>
<s> i have heard him pronounce that the tragedy of othello plato's records of the last scenes of the career of socrates and isaac walton's life of george herbert were in his opinion the most pathetic of human compositions <\s>
<s> in a walk one day after stopping according to his custom to claim admiration for some happy aspect of the landscape or beautiful composition on a smaller scale of natural objects caught by him at the precisely best point of view in the midst of his conversation on other subjects he added good humouredly that there were three callings for success in which nature had furnished him with qualifications the callings of poet landscape gardener and critic of pictures and works of art <\s>
<s> on hearing this i could not but remember how his qualifications for the second were proved by the surprising variety of natural beauties he managed to display to their best advantage from the very circumscribed limits of the garden at rydal mount an invisible hand of art everywhere working to use his own exquisite expression in the very spirit of nature and how many there were who have owed the charm of their grounds and gardens to direction sought from his well known taste and feeling <\s>
<s> as to works of art his criticism was not that of one versed in the history of the schools but always proceeding upon first principles the prima philosophia as he called it and it was as it appeared to me of the highest order <\s>

<s> g on the death of coleridge <\s>
<s> the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth <\s>
<s> it was the sunday evening after the event occurred that my brother and i walked over to the mount where we found the poet alone <\s>
<s> one of the first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been he said his friend for more than thirty years <\s>
<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>
<s> it appeared that his death was a relief from intense pain which however subsided at the interval of a few days before the event and that shortly after this cessation of agony he fell into a comatose state <\s>
<s> the most interesting part of the letter was the statement that the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other relatives and friends around him to give them his blessing and to express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the depth of his trust in his saviour christ <\s>
<s> as i heard this i was at once deeply glad at the substance and deeply affected by wordsworth's emotion in reading it <\s>
<s> when he came to this part his voice at first faltered and then broke but soon divine faith that the change was a blest one overcame aught of human grief and he concluded in an equable though subdued tone <\s>
<s> before i quit this subject i will tell you what i was interested in hearing from a person of the highest abilities 266 whom i had the good fortune of meeting at rydal mount <\s>
<s> he said that he had visited coleridge about a month before his death and had perceived at once his countenance pervaded by a most remarkable serenity <\s>
<s> on being congratulated on his appearance coleridge replied that he did now for the first time begin to hope from the mitigation of his pains that his health was undergoing a permanent improvement alas <\s>
<s> he was deceived yet may we not consider this hopeful feeling which is i believe by no means uncommon to be under such circumstances a valuable blessing ); but that what he felt most thankful for was the deep calm peace of mind which he then enjoyed a peace such as he had never before experienced or scarcely hoped for <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>
<s> to the above memorandum i now sept <\s>
<s> 1874 add two items of which i retain a distinct remembrance <\s>
<s> 1 he was in favour of the officiating clergyman being allowed to introduce into his reading of the lessons in church the authorised marginal corrections <\s>
<s> 2 he expressed in very strong terms his opinion that the prefatory portion of the marriage service should be altered so as to make it not only less repulsive to modern feelings but more accordant with the higher aspects of the union to be solemnised <\s>
<s> passion in poetry one day speaking of passion as an element of poetry he referred to his own poems and said that he thought there was a stronger fire of passion than was elsewhere to be found among them in the lyrical burst near the conclusion of the song at the feast of brougham castle armour rusting in his halls on the blood of clifford calls quell the scot exclaims the lance bear me to the heart of france is the longing of the shield <\s>
<s> chronological classification of poems many years ago i expressed to wordsworth a wish that his poems were printed in the order of their composition assigning as reasons for the wish the great interest which would attach to observing the progressive development of the poet's thought and the interpretative value of the light mutually reflected by poems of the same period <\s>
<s> i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion <\s>
<s> he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual <\s>
<s> i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in after days the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element <\s>
<s> verbal criticism wordsworth not only sympathised with the feelings expressed in southey's touching lines upon the dead but admired very much the easy flow of the verse and the perfect freedom from strain in the expression by which they are marked <\s>
<s> yet in the first two stanzas he noted three flaws and suggested changes by which they might have been easily avoided <\s>
<s> i have underlined the words he took exception to my days among the dead are past around me i behold where'er these casual eyes are cast the mighty minds of old my never failing friends are they with whom i converse day by day <\s>
<s> with them i take delight in weal and seek relief in woe and while i understand and feel how much to them i owe my cheeks have often been bedew'd with tears of thoughtful gratitude <\s>
<s> in the first stanza for where'er these casual eyes are cast which he objected to as not simple and natural and as scarcely correct he suggested where'er a casual look i cast and for converse the accent of which he condemned as belonging to the noun and not to the verb he suggested commune <\s>
<s> in the second stanza he pointed out the improper sequence of tenses in the third and fifth lines which he corrected by reading in the latter my cheeks are oftentimes bedew'd <\s>
<s> of the narrative poems of his friend well executed as he considered them and of the mainly external action of imagination or fancy in which they deal i have certainly heard him pronounce a very depreciatory opinion whether i ever heard him use the hard words attributed to him i would not give five shillings for a ream of them i cannot now assert but if used they were said in reference to the nobler kind of imaginative power which reveals to man the deep places and sublimer affinities of his own being <\s>
<s> but to some others of southey's verses as well as to the lines above quoted and to his prose writings in general he was wont to give liberal praise and no one could doubt the sincerity and warmth of his admiration of the intellect and virtues of the man or the brotherly affection towards him which he not unfrequently expressed <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>

<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>

<s> the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth <\s>
<s> it was the sunday evening after the event occurred that my brother and i walked over to the mount where we found the poet alone <\s>
<s> one of the first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been he said his friend for more than thirty years <\s>
<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>
<s> it appeared that his death was a relief from intense pain which however subsided at the interval of a few days before the event and that shortly after this cessation of agony he fell into a comatose state <\s>
<s> the most interesting part of the letter was the statement that the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other relatives and friends around him to give them his blessing and to express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the depth of his trust in his saviour christ <\s>
<s> as i heard this i was at once deeply glad at the substance and deeply affected by wordsworth's emotion in reading it <\s>
<s> when he came to this part his voice at first faltered and then broke but soon divine faith that the change was a blest one overcame aught of human grief and he concluded in an equable though subdued tone <\s>
<s> before i quit this subject i will tell you what i was interested in hearing from a person of the highest abilities 266 whom i had the good fortune of meeting at rydal mount <\s>
<s> he said that he had visited coleridge about a month before his death and had perceived at once his countenance pervaded by a most remarkable serenity <\s>
<s> on being congratulated on his appearance coleridge replied that he did now for the first time begin to hope from the mitigation of his pains that his health was undergoing a permanent improvement alas <\s>
<s> he was deceived yet may we not consider this hopeful feeling which is i believe by no means uncommon to be under such circumstances a valuable blessing ); but that what he felt most thankful for was the deep calm peace of mind which he then enjoyed a peace such as he had never before experienced or scarcely hoped for <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>

<s> 1874 add two items of which i retain a distinct remembrance <\s>

<s> passion in poetry one day speaking of passion as an element of poetry he referred to his own poems and said that he thought there was a stronger fire of passion than was elsewhere to be found among them in the lyrical burst near the conclusion of the song at the feast of brougham castle armour rusting in his halls on the blood of clifford calls quell the scot exclaims the lance bear me to the heart of france is the longing of the shield <\s>

<s> i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion <\s>
<s> he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual <\s>
<s> i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in after days the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element <\s>

<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>

<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>

<s> here his daily life is spent <\s>
<s> here in this room doubtless much of his poetry has been written words of power which are to go down with those of shakspeare and spenser and milton while our english tongue endures <\s>

<s> attaching a full value to the singular yet easily imagined and most picturesque circumstances of the adventurer's position to the admirable painting of the scenes and to the knowledge displayed of the working of human feelings he yet felt sure that the intense interest created by the story arose chiefly from the extraordinary energy and resource of the hero under his difficult circumstances from their being so far beyond what it was natural to expect or what would have been exhibited by the average of men and that similarly the high pleasure derived from his successes and good fortunes arose from the peculiar source of these uncommon merits of his character <\s>
<s> i have heard him pronounce that the tragedy of othello plato's records of the last scenes of the career of socrates and isaac walton's life of george herbert were in his opinion the most pathetic of human compositions <\s>
<s> in a walk one day after stopping according to his custom to claim admiration for some happy aspect of the landscape or beautiful composition on a smaller scale of natural objects caught by him at the precisely best point of view in the midst of his conversation on other subjects he added good humouredly that there were three callings for success in which nature had furnished him with qualifications the callings of poet landscape gardener and critic of pictures and works of art <\s>
<s> on hearing this i could not but remember how his qualifications for the second were proved by the surprising variety of natural beauties he managed to display to their best advantage from the very circumscribed limits of the garden at rydal mount an invisible hand of art everywhere working to use his own exquisite expression in the very spirit of nature and how many there were who have owed the charm of their grounds and gardens to direction sought from his well known taste and feeling <\s>
<s> as to works of art his criticism was not that of one versed in the history of the schools but always proceeding upon first principles the prima philosophia as he called it and it was as it appeared to me of the highest order <\s>
<s> he was a very great admirer of virgil not so much as a creative poet but as the most consummate master of language that perhaps ever existed <\s>

<s> the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth <\s>

<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>

<s> one of the first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been he said his friend for more than thirty years <\s>
<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>
<s> it appeared that his death was a relief from intense pain which however subsided at the interval of a few days before the event and that shortly after this cessation of agony he fell into a comatose state <\s>
<s> the most interesting part of the letter was the statement that the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other relatives and friends around him to give them his blessing and to express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the depth of his trust in his saviour christ <\s>
<s> as i heard this i was at once deeply glad at the substance and deeply affected by wordsworth's emotion in reading it <\s>

<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>

<s> i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion <\s>
<s> he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual <\s>
<s> i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in after days the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element <\s>

<s> in the first stanza for where'er these casual eyes are cast which he objected to as not simple and natural and as scarcely correct he suggested where'er a casual look i cast and for converse the accent of which he condemned as belonging to the noun and not to the verb he suggested commune <\s>

<s> but to some others of southey's verses as well as to the lines above quoted and to his prose writings in general he was wont to give liberal praise and no one could doubt the sincerity and warmth of his admiration of the intellect and virtues of the man or the brotherly affection towards him which he not unfrequently expressed <\s>

<s> feeling very grateful to you for the pleasure which that visit gave me and desiring to make a more minute record of it than either the letter i addressed to you from keswick or my journal written at the time contains i gladly comply with your request <\s>
<s> it was about noon on the 18th of august 1849 that i set out with my friends from their house near bowness to ride to ambleside <\s>
<s> our route was along the shore of lake windermere <\s>
<s> it was my first day among the english lakes and i enjoyed keenly the loveliness which was spread out before me <\s>
<s> my friends congratulated me on the clearness of the atmosphere and the bright skies <\s>
<s> twilight is all important in bringing out the full beauty of the lake region and in this respect i was very fortunate <\s>
<s> i had already been deeply moved by the tranquil beauty of windermere for as i came out of the cottage formerly professor wilson's where i had passed the night there it lay in all its grandeur its clear waters its green islands and its girdle of solemn mountains <\s>
<s> it was quite dark when i had been conducted to this cottage the night before so that i saw the lake for the first time in the light of early morning <\s>
<s> the first impression was confirmed by every new prospect as we rode along <\s>
<s> the vale seemed a very paradise for its sweet seclusion <\s>
<s> i had been told that after switzerland i should find little to attract me in this region but such was not the case <\s>
<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>
<s> the foliage is of the darkest green giving to the lake in which it is reflected the same sombre hue <\s>
<s> it seemed the fittest dwelling place for a poet amid all this quiet beauty <\s>
<s> it was half past one when we reached ambleside where i left mr <\s>
<s> b and walked on alone to rydal mount <\s>
<s> i was full of eager expectations as i thought how soon i should perhaps be in the presence of wordsworth that after long years of waiting of distant reverential admiration and love i was as i hoped to be favoured with a personal interview with the great poet philosopher to whom you and i and so many many others feel that we are under the deepest obligation for the good which has come to us from his writings <\s>
<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>
<s> i walked along the gravel pathway leading through shrubbery to the open space in front of the long two story cottage the poet's dwelling <\s>
<s> your sketch of the house by inman is a correct one but it gives no idea of the view from it which is its chief charm <\s>
<s> rydal mere with its islands and the mountains beyond it are all in sight <\s>

<s> it was evident that the greatest attention had been paid to the grounds for the flower beds were tastefully arranged and the gravel walks were in complete order <\s>
<s> one might be well content i thought to make his abode at a spot like this <\s>

<s> my dear friend you have asked me to write out as fully as i can an account of my visit to wordsworth last summer of which your letter of introduction was the occasion <\s>
<s> feeling very grateful to you for the pleasure which that visit gave me and desiring to make a more minute record of it than either the letter i addressed to you from keswick or my journal written at the time contains i gladly comply with your request <\s>
<s> it was about noon on the 18th of august 1849 that i set out with my friends from their house near bowness to ride to ambleside <\s>
<s> our route was along the shore of lake windermere <\s>
<s> it was my first day among the english lakes and i enjoyed keenly the loveliness which was spread out before me <\s>
<s> my friends congratulated me on the clearness of the atmosphere and the bright skies <\s>
<s> twilight is all important in bringing out the full beauty of the lake region and in this respect i was very fortunate <\s>
<s> i had already been deeply moved by the tranquil beauty of windermere for as i came out of the cottage formerly professor wilson's where i had passed the night there it lay in all its grandeur its clear waters its green islands and its girdle of solemn mountains <\s>
<s> it was quite dark when i had been conducted to this cottage the night before so that i saw the lake for the first time in the light of early morning <\s>
<s> the first impression was confirmed by every new prospect as we rode along <\s>
<s> the vale seemed a very paradise for its sweet seclusion <\s>
<s> i had been told that after switzerland i should find little to attract me in this region but such was not the case <\s>
<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>
<s> the foliage is of the darkest green giving to the lake in which it is reflected the same sombre hue <\s>
<s> it seemed the fittest dwelling place for a poet amid all this quiet beauty <\s>
<s> it was half past one when we reached ambleside where i left mr <\s>
<s> b and walked on alone to rydal mount <\s>
<s> i was full of eager expectations as i thought how soon i should perhaps be in the presence of wordsworth that after long years of waiting of distant reverential admiration and love i was as i hoped to be favoured with a personal interview with the great poet philosopher to whom you and i and so many many others feel that we are under the deepest obligation for the good which has come to us from his writings <\s>
<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>
<s> i walked along the gravel pathway leading through shrubbery to the open space in front of the long two story cottage the poet's dwelling <\s>
<s> your sketch of the house by inman is a correct one but it gives no idea of the view from it which is its chief charm <\s>
<s> rydal mere with its islands and the mountains beyond it are all in sight <\s>
<s> i had but a hasty enjoyment of this beauty nor could i notice carefully the flowers which were blooming around <\s>
<s> it was evident that the greatest attention had been paid to the grounds for the flower beds were tastefully arranged and the gravel walks were in complete order <\s>
<s> one might be well content i thought to make his abode at a spot like this <\s>
<s> a boy of about twelve years was occupied at one of the flower beds as i passed by he followed me to the door and waited my commands <\s>
<s> i asked if mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth was in .... <\s>
<s> he was dining would i walk into the drawing room and wait a short time ... <\s>
<s> i was shown into the drawing room or study i know not which to call it .... <\s>
<s> here i am i said to myself in the great poet's house <\s>
<s> here his daily life is spent <\s>
<s> here in this room doubtless much of his poetry has been written words of power which are to go down with those of shakspeare and spenser and milton while our english tongue endures <\s>
<s> it was a long apartment the ceiling low with two windows at one end looking out on the lawn and shrubbery <\s>
<s> many engravings were on the walls <\s>
<s> the famous madonna of raphael known as that of the dresden gallery hung directly over the fire place <\s>
<s> attaching a full value to the singular yet easily imagined and most picturesque circumstances of the adventurer's position to the admirable painting of the scenes and to the knowledge displayed of the working of human feelings he yet felt sure that the intense interest created by the story arose chiefly from the extraordinary energy and resource of the hero under his difficult circumstances from their being so far beyond what it was natural to expect or what would have been exhibited by the average of men and that similarly the high pleasure derived from his successes and good fortunes arose from the peculiar source of these uncommon merits of his character <\s>
<s> i have heard him pronounce that the tragedy of othello plato's records of the last scenes of the career of socrates and isaac walton's life of george herbert were in his opinion the most pathetic of human compositions <\s>
<s> in a walk one day after stopping according to his custom to claim admiration for some happy aspect of the landscape or beautiful composition on a smaller scale of natural objects caught by him at the precisely best point of view in the midst of his conversation on other subjects he added good humouredly that there were three callings for success in which nature had furnished him with qualifications the callings of poet landscape gardener and critic of pictures and works of art <\s>
<s> on hearing this i could not but remember how his qualifications for the second were proved by the surprising variety of natural beauties he managed to display to their best advantage from the very circumscribed limits of the garden at rydal mount an invisible hand of art everywhere working to use his own exquisite expression in the very spirit of nature and how many there were who have owed the charm of their grounds and gardens to direction sought from his well known taste and feeling <\s>
<s> as to works of art his criticism was not that of one versed in the history of the schools but always proceeding upon first principles the prima philosophia as he called it and it was as it appeared to me of the highest order <\s>

<s> g on the death of coleridge <\s>
<s> the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth <\s>
<s> it was the sunday evening after the event occurred that my brother and i walked over to the mount where we found the poet alone <\s>
<s> one of the first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been he said his friend for more than thirty years <\s>
<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>
<s> it appeared that his death was a relief from intense pain which however subsided at the interval of a few days before the event and that shortly after this cessation of agony he fell into a comatose state <\s>
<s> the most interesting part of the letter was the statement that the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other relatives and friends around him to give them his blessing and to express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the depth of his trust in his saviour christ <\s>
<s> as i heard this i was at once deeply glad at the substance and deeply affected by wordsworth's emotion in reading it <\s>
<s> when he came to this part his voice at first faltered and then broke but soon divine faith that the change was a blest one overcame aught of human grief and he concluded in an equable though subdued tone <\s>
<s> before i quit this subject i will tell you what i was interested in hearing from a person of the highest abilities 266 whom i had the good fortune of meeting at rydal mount <\s>
<s> he said that he had visited coleridge about a month before his death and had perceived at once his countenance pervaded by a most remarkable serenity <\s>
<s> on being congratulated on his appearance coleridge replied that he did now for the first time begin to hope from the mitigation of his pains that his health was undergoing a permanent improvement alas <\s>
<s> he was deceived yet may we not consider this hopeful feeling which is i believe by no means uncommon to be under such circumstances a valuable blessing ); but that what he felt most thankful for was the deep calm peace of mind which he then enjoyed a peace such as he had never before experienced or scarcely hoped for <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>
<s> to the above memorandum i now sept <\s>
<s> 1874 add two items of which i retain a distinct remembrance <\s>
<s> 1 he was in favour of the officiating clergyman being allowed to introduce into his reading of the lessons in church the authorised marginal corrections <\s>
<s> 2 he expressed in very strong terms his opinion that the prefatory portion of the marriage service should be altered so as to make it not only less repulsive to modern feelings but more accordant with the higher aspects of the union to be solemnised <\s>
<s> passion in poetry one day speaking of passion as an element of poetry he referred to his own poems and said that he thought there was a stronger fire of passion than was elsewhere to be found among them in the lyrical burst near the conclusion of the song at the feast of brougham castle armour rusting in his halls on the blood of clifford calls quell the scot exclaims the lance bear me to the heart of france is the longing of the shield <\s>
<s> chronological classification of poems many years ago i expressed to wordsworth a wish that his poems were printed in the order of their composition assigning as reasons for the wish the great interest which would attach to observing the progressive development of the poet's thought and the interpretative value of the light mutually reflected by poems of the same period <\s>
<s> i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion <\s>
<s> he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual <\s>
<s> i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in after days the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element <\s>
<s> verbal criticism wordsworth not only sympathised with the feelings expressed in southey's touching lines upon the dead but admired very much the easy flow of the verse and the perfect freedom from strain in the expression by which they are marked <\s>
<s> yet in the first two stanzas he noted three flaws and suggested changes by which they might have been easily avoided <\s>
<s> i have underlined the words he took exception to my days among the dead are past around me i behold where'er these casual eyes are cast the mighty minds of old my never failing friends are they with whom i converse day by day <\s>
<s> with them i take delight in weal and seek relief in woe and while i understand and feel how much to them i owe my cheeks have often been bedew'd with tears of thoughtful gratitude <\s>
<s> in the first stanza for where'er these casual eyes are cast which he objected to as not simple and natural and as scarcely correct he suggested where'er a casual look i cast and for converse the accent of which he condemned as belonging to the noun and not to the verb he suggested commune <\s>
<s> in the second stanza he pointed out the improper sequence of tenses in the third and fifth lines which he corrected by reading in the latter my cheeks are oftentimes bedew'd <\s>
<s> of the narrative poems of his friend well executed as he considered them and of the mainly external action of imagination or fancy in which they deal i have certainly heard him pronounce a very depreciatory opinion whether i ever heard him use the hard words attributed to him i would not give five shillings for a ream of them i cannot now assert but if used they were said in reference to the nobler kind of imaginative power which reveals to man the deep places and sublimer affinities of his own being <\s>
<s> but to some others of southey's verses as well as to the lines above quoted and to his prose writings in general he was wont to give liberal praise and no one could doubt the sincerity and warmth of his admiration of the intellect and virtues of the man or the brotherly affection towards him which he not unfrequently expressed <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>

<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>

<s> the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth <\s>
<s> it was the sunday evening after the event occurred that my brother and i walked over to the mount where we found the poet alone <\s>
<s> one of the first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been he said his friend for more than thirty years <\s>
<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>
<s> it appeared that his death was a relief from intense pain which however subsided at the interval of a few days before the event and that shortly after this cessation of agony he fell into a comatose state <\s>
<s> the most interesting part of the letter was the statement that the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other relatives and friends around him to give them his blessing and to express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the depth of his trust in his saviour christ <\s>
<s> as i heard this i was at once deeply glad at the substance and deeply affected by wordsworth's emotion in reading it <\s>
<s> when he came to this part his voice at first faltered and then broke but soon divine faith that the change was a blest one overcame aught of human grief and he concluded in an equable though subdued tone <\s>
<s> before i quit this subject i will tell you what i was interested in hearing from a person of the highest abilities 266 whom i had the good fortune of meeting at rydal mount <\s>
<s> he said that he had visited coleridge about a month before his death and had perceived at once his countenance pervaded by a most remarkable serenity <\s>
<s> on being congratulated on his appearance coleridge replied that he did now for the first time begin to hope from the mitigation of his pains that his health was undergoing a permanent improvement alas <\s>
<s> he was deceived yet may we not consider this hopeful feeling which is i believe by no means uncommon to be under such circumstances a valuable blessing ); but that what he felt most thankful for was the deep calm peace of mind which he then enjoyed a peace such as he had never before experienced or scarcely hoped for <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>

<s> 1874 add two items of which i retain a distinct remembrance <\s>

<s> passion in poetry one day speaking of passion as an element of poetry he referred to his own poems and said that he thought there was a stronger fire of passion than was elsewhere to be found among them in the lyrical burst near the conclusion of the song at the feast of brougham castle armour rusting in his halls on the blood of clifford calls quell the scot exclaims the lance bear me to the heart of france is the longing of the shield <\s>

<s> i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion <\s>
<s> he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual <\s>
<s> i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in after days the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element <\s>

<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>

<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>

<s> here his daily life is spent <\s>
<s> here in this room doubtless much of his poetry has been written words of power which are to go down with those of shakspeare and spenser and milton while our english tongue endures <\s>

<s> attaching a full value to the singular yet easily imagined and most picturesque circumstances of the adventurer's position to the admirable painting of the scenes and to the knowledge displayed of the working of human feelings he yet felt sure that the intense interest created by the story arose chiefly from the extraordinary energy and resource of the hero under his difficult circumstances from their being so far beyond what it was natural to expect or what would have been exhibited by the average of men and that similarly the high pleasure derived from his successes and good fortunes arose from the peculiar source of these uncommon merits of his character <\s>
<s> i have heard him pronounce that the tragedy of othello plato's records of the last scenes of the career of socrates and isaac walton's life of george herbert were in his opinion the most pathetic of human compositions <\s>
<s> in a walk one day after stopping according to his custom to claim admiration for some happy aspect of the landscape or beautiful composition on a smaller scale of natural objects caught by him at the precisely best point of view in the midst of his conversation on other subjects he added good humouredly that there were three callings for success in which nature had furnished him with qualifications the callings of poet landscape gardener and critic of pictures and works of art <\s>
<s> on hearing this i could not but remember how his qualifications for the second were proved by the surprising variety of natural beauties he managed to display to their best advantage from the very circumscribed limits of the garden at rydal mount an invisible hand of art everywhere working to use his own exquisite expression in the very spirit of nature and how many there were who have owed the charm of their grounds and gardens to direction sought from his well known taste and feeling <\s>
<s> as to works of art his criticism was not that of one versed in the history of the schools but always proceeding upon first principles the prima philosophia as he called it and it was as it appeared to me of the highest order <\s>
<s> he was a very great admirer of virgil not so much as a creative poet but as the most consummate master of language that perhaps ever existed <\s>

<s> the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth <\s>

<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>

<s> one of the first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been he said his friend for more than thirty years <\s>
<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>
<s> it appeared that his death was a relief from intense pain which however subsided at the interval of a few days before the event and that shortly after this cessation of agony he fell into a comatose state <\s>
<s> the most interesting part of the letter was the statement that the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other relatives and friends around him to give them his blessing and to express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the depth of his trust in his saviour christ <\s>
<s> as i heard this i was at once deeply glad at the substance and deeply affected by wordsworth's emotion in reading it <\s>

<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>

<s> i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion <\s>
<s> he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual <\s>
<s> i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in after days the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element <\s>

<s> in the first stanza for where'er these casual eyes are cast which he objected to as not simple and natural and as scarcely correct he suggested where'er a casual look i cast and for converse the accent of which he condemned as belonging to the noun and not to the verb he suggested commune <\s>

<s> but to some others of southey's verses as well as to the lines above quoted and to his prose writings in general he was wont to give liberal praise and no one could doubt the sincerity and warmth of his admiration of the intellect and virtues of the man or the brotherly affection towards him which he not unfrequently expressed <\s>

<s> feeling very grateful to you for the pleasure which that visit gave me and desiring to make a more minute record of it than either the letter i addressed to you from keswick or my journal written at the time contains i gladly comply with your request <\s>
<s> it was about noon on the 18th of august 1849 that i set out with my friends from their house near bowness to ride to ambleside <\s>
<s> our route was along the shore of lake windermere <\s>
<s> it was my first day among the english lakes and i enjoyed keenly the loveliness which was spread out before me <\s>
<s> my friends congratulated me on the clearness of the atmosphere and the bright skies <\s>
<s> twilight is all important in bringing out the full beauty of the lake region and in this respect i was very fortunate <\s>
<s> i had already been deeply moved by the tranquil beauty of windermere for as i came out of the cottage formerly professor wilson's where i had passed the night there it lay in all its grandeur its clear waters its green islands and its girdle of solemn mountains <\s>
<s> it was quite dark when i had been conducted to this cottage the night before so that i saw the lake for the first time in the light of early morning <\s>
<s> the first impression was confirmed by every new prospect as we rode along <\s>
<s> the vale seemed a very paradise for its sweet seclusion <\s>
<s> i had been told that after switzerland i should find little to attract me in this region but such was not the case <\s>
<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>
<s> the foliage is of the darkest green giving to the lake in which it is reflected the same sombre hue <\s>
<s> it seemed the fittest dwelling place for a poet amid all this quiet beauty <\s>
<s> it was half past one when we reached ambleside where i left mr <\s>
<s> b and walked on alone to rydal mount <\s>
<s> i was full of eager expectations as i thought how soon i should perhaps be in the presence of wordsworth that after long years of waiting of distant reverential admiration and love i was as i hoped to be favoured with a personal interview with the great poet philosopher to whom you and i and so many many others feel that we are under the deepest obligation for the good which has come to us from his writings <\s>
<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>
<s> i walked along the gravel pathway leading through shrubbery to the open space in front of the long two story cottage the poet's dwelling <\s>
<s> your sketch of the house by inman is a correct one but it gives no idea of the view from it which is its chief charm <\s>
<s> rydal mere with its islands and the mountains beyond it are all in sight <\s>

<s> it was evident that the greatest attention had been paid to the grounds for the flower beds were tastefully arranged and the gravel walks were in complete order <\s>
<s> one might be well content i thought to make his abode at a spot like this <\s>

<s> my dear friend you have asked me to write out as fully as i can an account of my visit to wordsworth last summer of which your letter of introduction was the occasion <\s>
<s> feeling very grateful to you for the pleasure which that visit gave me and desiring to make a more minute record of it than either the letter i addressed to you from keswick or my journal written at the time contains i gladly comply with your request <\s>
<s> it was about noon on the 18th of august 1849 that i set out with my friends from their house near bowness to ride to ambleside <\s>
<s> our route was along the shore of lake windermere <\s>
<s> it was my first day among the english lakes and i enjoyed keenly the loveliness which was spread out before me <\s>
<s> my friends congratulated me on the clearness of the atmosphere and the bright skies <\s>
<s> twilight is all important in bringing out the full beauty of the lake region and in this respect i was very fortunate <\s>
<s> i had already been deeply moved by the tranquil beauty of windermere for as i came out of the cottage formerly professor wilson's where i had passed the night there it lay in all its grandeur its clear waters its green islands and its girdle of solemn mountains <\s>
<s> it was quite dark when i had been conducted to this cottage the night before so that i saw the lake for the first time in the light of early morning <\s>
<s> the first impression was confirmed by every new prospect as we rode along <\s>
<s> the vale seemed a very paradise for its sweet seclusion <\s>
<s> i had been told that after switzerland i should find little to attract me in this region but such was not the case <\s>
<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>
<s> the foliage is of the darkest green giving to the lake in which it is reflected the same sombre hue <\s>
<s> it seemed the fittest dwelling place for a poet amid all this quiet beauty <\s>
<s> it was half past one when we reached ambleside where i left mr <\s>
<s> b and walked on alone to rydal mount <\s>
<s> i was full of eager expectations as i thought how soon i should perhaps be in the presence of wordsworth that after long years of waiting of distant reverential admiration and love i was as i hoped to be favoured with a personal interview with the great poet philosopher to whom you and i and so many many others feel that we are under the deepest obligation for the good which has come to us from his writings <\s>
<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>
<s> i walked along the gravel pathway leading through shrubbery to the open space in front of the long two story cottage the poet's dwelling <\s>
<s> your sketch of the house by inman is a correct one but it gives no idea of the view from it which is its chief charm <\s>
<s> rydal mere with its islands and the mountains beyond it are all in sight <\s>
<s> i had but a hasty enjoyment of this beauty nor could i notice carefully the flowers which were blooming around <\s>
<s> it was evident that the greatest attention had been paid to the grounds for the flower beds were tastefully arranged and the gravel walks were in complete order <\s>
<s> one might be well content i thought to make his abode at a spot like this <\s>
<s> a boy of about twelve years was occupied at one of the flower beds as i passed by he followed me to the door and waited my commands <\s>
<s> i asked if mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth was in .... <\s>
<s> he was dining would i walk into the drawing room and wait a short time ... <\s>
<s> i was shown into the drawing room or study i know not which to call it .... <\s>
<s> here i am i said to myself in the great poet's house <\s>
<s> here his daily life is spent <\s>
<s> here in this room doubtless much of his poetry has been written words of power which are to go down with those of shakspeare and spenser and milton while our english tongue endures <\s>
<s> it was a long apartment the ceiling low with two windows at one end looking out on the lawn and shrubbery <\s>
<s> many engravings were on the walls <\s>
<s> the famous madonna of raphael known as that of the dresden gallery hung directly over the fire place <\s>
<s> attaching a full value to the singular yet easily imagined and most picturesque circumstances of the adventurer's position to the admirable painting of the scenes and to the knowledge displayed of the working of human feelings he yet felt sure that the intense interest created by the story arose chiefly from the extraordinary energy and resource of the hero under his difficult circumstances from their being so far beyond what it was natural to expect or what would have been exhibited by the average of men and that similarly the high pleasure derived from his successes and good fortunes arose from the peculiar source of these uncommon merits of his character <\s>
<s> i have heard him pronounce that the tragedy of othello plato's records of the last scenes of the career of socrates and isaac walton's life of george herbert were in his opinion the most pathetic of human compositions <\s>
<s> in a walk one day after stopping according to his custom to claim admiration for some happy aspect of the landscape or beautiful composition on a smaller scale of natural objects caught by him at the precisely best point of view in the midst of his conversation on other subjects he added good humouredly that there were three callings for success in which nature had furnished him with qualifications the callings of poet landscape gardener and critic of pictures and works of art <\s>
<s> on hearing this i could not but remember how his qualifications for the second were proved by the surprising variety of natural beauties he managed to display to their best advantage from the very circumscribed limits of the garden at rydal mount an invisible hand of art everywhere working to use his own exquisite expression in the very spirit of nature and how many there were who have owed the charm of their grounds and gardens to direction sought from his well known taste and feeling <\s>
<s> as to works of art his criticism was not that of one versed in the history of the schools but always proceeding upon first principles the prima philosophia as he called it and it was as it appeared to me of the highest order <\s>

<s> g on the death of coleridge <\s>
<s> the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth <\s>
<s> it was the sunday evening after the event occurred that my brother and i walked over to the mount where we found the poet alone <\s>
<s> one of the first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been he said his friend for more than thirty years <\s>
<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>
<s> it appeared that his death was a relief from intense pain which however subsided at the interval of a few days before the event and that shortly after this cessation of agony he fell into a comatose state <\s>
<s> the most interesting part of the letter was the statement that the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other relatives and friends around him to give them his blessing and to express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the depth of his trust in his saviour christ <\s>
<s> as i heard this i was at once deeply glad at the substance and deeply affected by wordsworth's emotion in reading it <\s>
<s> when he came to this part his voice at first faltered and then broke but soon divine faith that the change was a blest one overcame aught of human grief and he concluded in an equable though subdued tone <\s>
<s> before i quit this subject i will tell you what i was interested in hearing from a person of the highest abilities 266 whom i had the good fortune of meeting at rydal mount <\s>
<s> he said that he had visited coleridge about a month before his death and had perceived at once his countenance pervaded by a most remarkable serenity <\s>
<s> on being congratulated on his appearance coleridge replied that he did now for the first time begin to hope from the mitigation of his pains that his health was undergoing a permanent improvement alas <\s>
<s> he was deceived yet may we not consider this hopeful feeling which is i believe by no means uncommon to be under such circumstances a valuable blessing ); but that what he felt most thankful for was the deep calm peace of mind which he then enjoyed a peace such as he had never before experienced or scarcely hoped for <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>
<s> to the above memorandum i now sept <\s>
<s> 1874 add two items of which i retain a distinct remembrance <\s>
<s> 1 he was in favour of the officiating clergyman being allowed to introduce into his reading of the lessons in church the authorised marginal corrections <\s>
<s> 2 he expressed in very strong terms his opinion that the prefatory portion of the marriage service should be altered so as to make it not only less repulsive to modern feelings but more accordant with the higher aspects of the union to be solemnised <\s>
<s> passion in poetry one day speaking of passion as an element of poetry he referred to his own poems and said that he thought there was a stronger fire of passion than was elsewhere to be found among them in the lyrical burst near the conclusion of the song at the feast of brougham castle armour rusting in his halls on the blood of clifford calls quell the scot exclaims the lance bear me to the heart of france is the longing of the shield <\s>
<s> chronological classification of poems many years ago i expressed to wordsworth a wish that his poems were printed in the order of their composition assigning as reasons for the wish the great interest which would attach to observing the progressive development of the poet's thought and the interpretative value of the light mutually reflected by poems of the same period <\s>
<s> i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion <\s>
<s> he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual <\s>
<s> i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in after days the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element <\s>
<s> verbal criticism wordsworth not only sympathised with the feelings expressed in southey's touching lines upon the dead but admired very much the easy flow of the verse and the perfect freedom from strain in the expression by which they are marked <\s>
<s> yet in the first two stanzas he noted three flaws and suggested changes by which they might have been easily avoided <\s>
<s> i have underlined the words he took exception to my days among the dead are past around me i behold where'er these casual eyes are cast the mighty minds of old my never failing friends are they with whom i converse day by day <\s>
<s> with them i take delight in weal and seek relief in woe and while i understand and feel how much to them i owe my cheeks have often been bedew'd with tears of thoughtful gratitude <\s>
<s> in the first stanza for where'er these casual eyes are cast which he objected to as not simple and natural and as scarcely correct he suggested where'er a casual look i cast and for converse the accent of which he condemned as belonging to the noun and not to the verb he suggested commune <\s>
<s> in the second stanza he pointed out the improper sequence of tenses in the third and fifth lines which he corrected by reading in the latter my cheeks are oftentimes bedew'd <\s>
<s> of the narrative poems of his friend well executed as he considered them and of the mainly external action of imagination or fancy in which they deal i have certainly heard him pronounce a very depreciatory opinion whether i ever heard him use the hard words attributed to him i would not give five shillings for a ream of them i cannot now assert but if used they were said in reference to the nobler kind of imaginative power which reveals to man the deep places and sublimer affinities of his own being <\s>
<s> but to some others of southey's verses as well as to the lines above quoted and to his prose writings in general he was wont to give liberal praise and no one could doubt the sincerity and warmth of his admiration of the intellect and virtues of the man or the brotherly affection towards him which he not unfrequently expressed <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>

<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>

<s> the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth <\s>
<s> it was the sunday evening after the event occurred that my brother and i walked over to the mount where we found the poet alone <\s>
<s> one of the first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been he said his friend for more than thirty years <\s>
<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>
<s> it appeared that his death was a relief from intense pain which however subsided at the interval of a few days before the event and that shortly after this cessation of agony he fell into a comatose state <\s>
<s> the most interesting part of the letter was the statement that the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other relatives and friends around him to give them his blessing and to express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the depth of his trust in his saviour christ <\s>
<s> as i heard this i was at once deeply glad at the substance and deeply affected by wordsworth's emotion in reading it <\s>
<s> when he came to this part his voice at first faltered and then broke but soon divine faith that the change was a blest one overcame aught of human grief and he concluded in an equable though subdued tone <\s>
<s> before i quit this subject i will tell you what i was interested in hearing from a person of the highest abilities 266 whom i had the good fortune of meeting at rydal mount <\s>
<s> he said that he had visited coleridge about a month before his death and had perceived at once his countenance pervaded by a most remarkable serenity <\s>
<s> on being congratulated on his appearance coleridge replied that he did now for the first time begin to hope from the mitigation of his pains that his health was undergoing a permanent improvement alas <\s>
<s> he was deceived yet may we not consider this hopeful feeling which is i believe by no means uncommon to be under such circumstances a valuable blessing ); but that what he felt most thankful for was the deep calm peace of mind which he then enjoyed a peace such as he had never before experienced or scarcely hoped for <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>

<s> 1874 add two items of which i retain a distinct remembrance <\s>

<s> passion in poetry one day speaking of passion as an element of poetry he referred to his own poems and said that he thought there was a stronger fire of passion than was elsewhere to be found among them in the lyrical burst near the conclusion of the song at the feast of brougham castle armour rusting in his halls on the blood of clifford calls quell the scot exclaims the lance bear me to the heart of france is the longing of the shield <\s>

<s> i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion <\s>
<s> he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual <\s>
<s> i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in after days the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element <\s>

<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>

<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>

<s> here his daily life is spent <\s>
<s> here in this room doubtless much of his poetry has been written words of power which are to go down with those of shakspeare and spenser and milton while our english tongue endures <\s>

<s> attaching a full value to the singular yet easily imagined and most picturesque circumstances of the adventurer's position to the admirable painting of the scenes and to the knowledge displayed of the working of human feelings he yet felt sure that the intense interest created by the story arose chiefly from the extraordinary energy and resource of the hero under his difficult circumstances from their being so far beyond what it was natural to expect or what would have been exhibited by the average of men and that similarly the high pleasure derived from his successes and good fortunes arose from the peculiar source of these uncommon merits of his character <\s>
<s> i have heard him pronounce that the tragedy of othello plato's records of the last scenes of the career of socrates and isaac walton's life of george herbert were in his opinion the most pathetic of human compositions <\s>
<s> in a walk one day after stopping according to his custom to claim admiration for some happy aspect of the landscape or beautiful composition on a smaller scale of natural objects caught by him at the precisely best point of view in the midst of his conversation on other subjects he added good humouredly that there were three callings for success in which nature had furnished him with qualifications the callings of poet landscape gardener and critic of pictures and works of art <\s>
<s> on hearing this i could not but remember how his qualifications for the second were proved by the surprising variety of natural beauties he managed to display to their best advantage from the very circumscribed limits of the garden at rydal mount an invisible hand of art everywhere working to use his own exquisite expression in the very spirit of nature and how many there were who have owed the charm of their grounds and gardens to direction sought from his well known taste and feeling <\s>
<s> as to works of art his criticism was not that of one versed in the history of the schools but always proceeding upon first principles the prima philosophia as he called it and it was as it appeared to me of the highest order <\s>
<s> he was a very great admirer of virgil not so much as a creative poet but as the most consummate master of language that perhaps ever existed <\s>

<s> the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth <\s>

<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>

<s> one of the first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been he said his friend for more than thirty years <\s>
<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>
<s> it appeared that his death was a relief from intense pain which however subsided at the interval of a few days before the event and that shortly after this cessation of agony he fell into a comatose state <\s>
<s> the most interesting part of the letter was the statement that the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other relatives and friends around him to give them his blessing and to express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the depth of his trust in his saviour christ <\s>
<s> as i heard this i was at once deeply glad at the substance and deeply affected by wordsworth's emotion in reading it <\s>

<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>

<s> i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion <\s>
<s> he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual <\s>
<s> i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in after days the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element <\s>

<s> in the first stanza for where'er these casual eyes are cast which he objected to as not simple and natural and as scarcely correct he suggested where'er a casual look i cast and for converse the accent of which he condemned as belonging to the noun and not to the verb he suggested commune <\s>

<s> but to some others of southey's verses as well as to the lines above quoted and to his prose writings in general he was wont to give liberal praise and no one could doubt the sincerity and warmth of his admiration of the intellect and virtues of the man or the brotherly affection towards him which he not unfrequently expressed <\s>

<s> feeling very grateful to you for the pleasure which that visit gave me and desiring to make a more minute record of it than either the letter i addressed to you from keswick or my journal written at the time contains i gladly comply with your request <\s>
<s> it was about noon on the 18th of august 1849 that i set out with my friends from their house near bowness to ride to ambleside <\s>
<s> our route was along the shore of lake windermere <\s>
<s> it was my first day among the english lakes and i enjoyed keenly the loveliness which was spread out before me <\s>
<s> my friends congratulated me on the clearness of the atmosphere and the bright skies <\s>
<s> twilight is all important in bringing out the full beauty of the lake region and in this respect i was very fortunate <\s>
<s> i had already been deeply moved by the tranquil beauty of windermere for as i came out of the cottage formerly professor wilson's where i had passed the night there it lay in all its grandeur its clear waters its green islands and its girdle of solemn mountains <\s>
<s> it was quite dark when i had been conducted to this cottage the night before so that i saw the lake for the first time in the light of early morning <\s>
<s> the first impression was confirmed by every new prospect as we rode along <\s>
<s> the vale seemed a very paradise for its sweet seclusion <\s>
<s> i had been told that after switzerland i should find little to attract me in this region but such was not the case <\s>
<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>
<s> the foliage is of the darkest green giving to the lake in which it is reflected the same sombre hue <\s>
<s> it seemed the fittest dwelling place for a poet amid all this quiet beauty <\s>
<s> it was half past one when we reached ambleside where i left mr <\s>
<s> b and walked on alone to rydal mount <\s>
<s> i was full of eager expectations as i thought how soon i should perhaps be in the presence of wordsworth that after long years of waiting of distant reverential admiration and love i was as i hoped to be favoured with a personal interview with the great poet philosopher to whom you and i and so many many others feel that we are under the deepest obligation for the good which has come to us from his writings <\s>
<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>
<s> i walked along the gravel pathway leading through shrubbery to the open space in front of the long two story cottage the poet's dwelling <\s>
<s> your sketch of the house by inman is a correct one but it gives no idea of the view from it which is its chief charm <\s>
<s> rydal mere with its islands and the mountains beyond it are all in sight <\s>

<s> it was evident that the greatest attention had been paid to the grounds for the flower beds were tastefully arranged and the gravel walks were in complete order <\s>
<s> one might be well content i thought to make his abode at a spot like this <\s>

<s> my dear friend you have asked me to write out as fully as i can an account of my visit to wordsworth last summer of which your letter of introduction was the occasion <\s>
<s> feeling very grateful to you for the pleasure which that visit gave me and desiring to make a more minute record of it than either the letter i addressed to you from keswick or my journal written at the time contains i gladly comply with your request <\s>
<s> it was about noon on the 18th of august 1849 that i set out with my friends from their house near bowness to ride to ambleside <\s>
<s> our route was along the shore of lake windermere <\s>
<s> it was my first day among the english lakes and i enjoyed keenly the loveliness which was spread out before me <\s>
<s> my friends congratulated me on the clearness of the atmosphere and the bright skies <\s>
<s> twilight is all important in bringing out the full beauty of the lake region and in this respect i was very fortunate <\s>
<s> i had already been deeply moved by the tranquil beauty of windermere for as i came out of the cottage formerly professor wilson's where i had passed the night there it lay in all its grandeur its clear waters its green islands and its girdle of solemn mountains <\s>
<s> it was quite dark when i had been conducted to this cottage the night before so that i saw the lake for the first time in the light of early morning <\s>
<s> the first impression was confirmed by every new prospect as we rode along <\s>
<s> the vale seemed a very paradise for its sweet seclusion <\s>
<s> i had been told that after switzerland i should find little to attract me in this region but such was not the case <\s>
<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>
<s> the foliage is of the darkest green giving to the lake in which it is reflected the same sombre hue <\s>
<s> it seemed the fittest dwelling place for a poet amid all this quiet beauty <\s>
<s> it was half past one when we reached ambleside where i left mr <\s>
<s> b and walked on alone to rydal mount <\s>
<s> i was full of eager expectations as i thought how soon i should perhaps be in the presence of wordsworth that after long years of waiting of distant reverential admiration and love i was as i hoped to be favoured with a personal interview with the great poet philosopher to whom you and i and so many many others feel that we are under the deepest obligation for the good which has come to us from his writings <\s>
<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>
<s> i walked along the gravel pathway leading through shrubbery to the open space in front of the long two story cottage the poet's dwelling <\s>
<s> your sketch of the house by inman is a correct one but it gives no idea of the view from it which is its chief charm <\s>
<s> rydal mere with its islands and the mountains beyond it are all in sight <\s>
<s> i had but a hasty enjoyment of this beauty nor could i notice carefully the flowers which were blooming around <\s>
<s> it was evident that the greatest attention had been paid to the grounds for the flower beds were tastefully arranged and the gravel walks were in complete order <\s>
<s> one might be well content i thought to make his abode at a spot like this <\s>
<s> a boy of about twelve years was occupied at one of the flower beds as i passed by he followed me to the door and waited my commands <\s>
<s> i asked if mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth was in .... <\s>
<s> he was dining would i walk into the drawing room and wait a short time ... <\s>
<s> i was shown into the drawing room or study i know not which to call it .... <\s>
<s> here i am i said to myself in the great poet's house <\s>
<s> here his daily life is spent <\s>
<s> here in this room doubtless much of his poetry has been written words of power which are to go down with those of shakspeare and spenser and milton while our english tongue endures <\s>
<s> it was a long apartment the ceiling low with two windows at one end looking out on the lawn and shrubbery <\s>
<s> many engravings were on the walls <\s>
<s> the famous madonna of raphael known as that of the dresden gallery hung directly over the fire place <\s>
<s> attaching a full value to the singular yet easily imagined and most picturesque circumstances of the adventurer's position to the admirable painting of the scenes and to the knowledge displayed of the working of human feelings he yet felt sure that the intense interest created by the story arose chiefly from the extraordinary energy and resource of the hero under his difficult circumstances from their being so far beyond what it was natural to expect or what would have been exhibited by the average of men and that similarly the high pleasure derived from his successes and good fortunes arose from the peculiar source of these uncommon merits of his character <\s>
<s> i have heard him pronounce that the tragedy of othello plato's records of the last scenes of the career of socrates and isaac walton's life of george herbert were in his opinion the most pathetic of human compositions <\s>
<s> in a walk one day after stopping according to his custom to claim admiration for some happy aspect of the landscape or beautiful composition on a smaller scale of natural objects caught by him at the precisely best point of view in the midst of his conversation on other subjects he added good humouredly that there were three callings for success in which nature had furnished him with qualifications the callings of poet landscape gardener and critic of pictures and works of art <\s>
<s> on hearing this i could not but remember how his qualifications for the second were proved by the surprising variety of natural beauties he managed to display to their best advantage from the very circumscribed limits of the garden at rydal mount an invisible hand of art everywhere working to use his own exquisite expression in the very spirit of nature and how many there were who have owed the charm of their grounds and gardens to direction sought from his well known taste and feeling <\s>
<s> as to works of art his criticism was not that of one versed in the history of the schools but always proceeding upon first principles the prima philosophia as he called it and it was as it appeared to me of the highest order <\s>

<s> g on the death of coleridge <\s>
<s> the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth <\s>
<s> it was the sunday evening after the event occurred that my brother and i walked over to the mount where we found the poet alone <\s>
<s> one of the first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been he said his friend for more than thirty years <\s>
<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>
<s> it appeared that his death was a relief from intense pain which however subsided at the interval of a few days before the event and that shortly after this cessation of agony he fell into a comatose state <\s>
<s> the most interesting part of the letter was the statement that the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other relatives and friends around him to give them his blessing and to express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the depth of his trust in his saviour christ <\s>
<s> as i heard this i was at once deeply glad at the substance and deeply affected by wordsworth's emotion in reading it <\s>
<s> when he came to this part his voice at first faltered and then broke but soon divine faith that the change was a blest one overcame aught of human grief and he concluded in an equable though subdued tone <\s>
<s> before i quit this subject i will tell you what i was interested in hearing from a person of the highest abilities 266 whom i had the good fortune of meeting at rydal mount <\s>
<s> he said that he had visited coleridge about a month before his death and had perceived at once his countenance pervaded by a most remarkable serenity <\s>
<s> on being congratulated on his appearance coleridge replied that he did now for the first time begin to hope from the mitigation of his pains that his health was undergoing a permanent improvement alas <\s>
<s> he was deceived yet may we not consider this hopeful feeling which is i believe by no means uncommon to be under such circumstances a valuable blessing ); but that what he felt most thankful for was the deep calm peace of mind which he then enjoyed a peace such as he had never before experienced or scarcely hoped for <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>
<s> to the above memorandum i now sept <\s>
<s> 1874 add two items of which i retain a distinct remembrance <\s>
<s> 1 he was in favour of the officiating clergyman being allowed to introduce into his reading of the lessons in church the authorised marginal corrections <\s>
<s> 2 he expressed in very strong terms his opinion that the prefatory portion of the marriage service should be altered so as to make it not only less repulsive to modern feelings but more accordant with the higher aspects of the union to be solemnised <\s>
<s> passion in poetry one day speaking of passion as an element of poetry he referred to his own poems and said that he thought there was a stronger fire of passion than was elsewhere to be found among them in the lyrical burst near the conclusion of the song at the feast of brougham castle armour rusting in his halls on the blood of clifford calls quell the scot exclaims the lance bear me to the heart of france is the longing of the shield <\s>
<s> chronological classification of poems many years ago i expressed to wordsworth a wish that his poems were printed in the order of their composition assigning as reasons for the wish the great interest which would attach to observing the progressive development of the poet's thought and the interpretative value of the light mutually reflected by poems of the same period <\s>
<s> i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion <\s>
<s> he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual <\s>
<s> i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in after days the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element <\s>
<s> verbal criticism wordsworth not only sympathised with the feelings expressed in southey's touching lines upon the dead but admired very much the easy flow of the verse and the perfect freedom from strain in the expression by which they are marked <\s>
<s> yet in the first two stanzas he noted three flaws and suggested changes by which they might have been easily avoided <\s>
<s> i have underlined the words he took exception to my days among the dead are past around me i behold where'er these casual eyes are cast the mighty minds of old my never failing friends are they with whom i converse day by day <\s>
<s> with them i take delight in weal and seek relief in woe and while i understand and feel how much to them i owe my cheeks have often been bedew'd with tears of thoughtful gratitude <\s>
<s> in the first stanza for where'er these casual eyes are cast which he objected to as not simple and natural and as scarcely correct he suggested where'er a casual look i cast and for converse the accent of which he condemned as belonging to the noun and not to the verb he suggested commune <\s>
<s> in the second stanza he pointed out the improper sequence of tenses in the third and fifth lines which he corrected by reading in the latter my cheeks are oftentimes bedew'd <\s>
<s> of the narrative poems of his friend well executed as he considered them and of the mainly external action of imagination or fancy in which they deal i have certainly heard him pronounce a very depreciatory opinion whether i ever heard him use the hard words attributed to him i would not give five shillings for a ream of them i cannot now assert but if used they were said in reference to the nobler kind of imaginative power which reveals to man the deep places and sublimer affinities of his own being <\s>
<s> but to some others of southey's verses as well as to the lines above quoted and to his prose writings in general he was wont to give liberal praise and no one could doubt the sincerity and warmth of his admiration of the intellect and virtues of the man or the brotherly affection towards him which he not unfrequently expressed <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>

<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>

<s> the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth <\s>
<s> it was the sunday evening after the event occurred that my brother and i walked over to the mount where we found the poet alone <\s>
<s> one of the first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been he said his friend for more than thirty years <\s>
<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>
<s> it appeared that his death was a relief from intense pain which however subsided at the interval of a few days before the event and that shortly after this cessation of agony he fell into a comatose state <\s>
<s> the most interesting part of the letter was the statement that the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other relatives and friends around him to give them his blessing and to express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the depth of his trust in his saviour christ <\s>
<s> as i heard this i was at once deeply glad at the substance and deeply affected by wordsworth's emotion in reading it <\s>
<s> when he came to this part his voice at first faltered and then broke but soon divine faith that the change was a blest one overcame aught of human grief and he concluded in an equable though subdued tone <\s>
<s> before i quit this subject i will tell you what i was interested in hearing from a person of the highest abilities 266 whom i had the good fortune of meeting at rydal mount <\s>
<s> he said that he had visited coleridge about a month before his death and had perceived at once his countenance pervaded by a most remarkable serenity <\s>
<s> on being congratulated on his appearance coleridge replied that he did now for the first time begin to hope from the mitigation of his pains that his health was undergoing a permanent improvement alas <\s>
<s> he was deceived yet may we not consider this hopeful feeling which is i believe by no means uncommon to be under such circumstances a valuable blessing ); but that what he felt most thankful for was the deep calm peace of mind which he then enjoyed a peace such as he had never before experienced or scarcely hoped for <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>

<s> 1874 add two items of which i retain a distinct remembrance <\s>

<s> passion in poetry one day speaking of passion as an element of poetry he referred to his own poems and said that he thought there was a stronger fire of passion than was elsewhere to be found among them in the lyrical burst near the conclusion of the song at the feast of brougham castle armour rusting in his halls on the blood of clifford calls quell the scot exclaims the lance bear me to the heart of france is the longing of the shield <\s>

<s> i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion <\s>
<s> he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual <\s>
<s> i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in after days the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element <\s>

<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>

<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>

<s> here his daily life is spent <\s>
<s> here in this room doubtless much of his poetry has been written words of power which are to go down with those of shakspeare and spenser and milton while our english tongue endures <\s>

<s> attaching a full value to the singular yet easily imagined and most picturesque circumstances of the adventurer's position to the admirable painting of the scenes and to the knowledge displayed of the working of human feelings he yet felt sure that the intense interest created by the story arose chiefly from the extraordinary energy and resource of the hero under his difficult circumstances from their being so far beyond what it was natural to expect or what would have been exhibited by the average of men and that similarly the high pleasure derived from his successes and good fortunes arose from the peculiar source of these uncommon merits of his character <\s>
<s> i have heard him pronounce that the tragedy of othello plato's records of the last scenes of the career of socrates and isaac walton's life of george herbert were in his opinion the most pathetic of human compositions <\s>
<s> in a walk one day after stopping according to his custom to claim admiration for some happy aspect of the landscape or beautiful composition on a smaller scale of natural objects caught by him at the precisely best point of view in the midst of his conversation on other subjects he added good humouredly that there were three callings for success in which nature had furnished him with qualifications the callings of poet landscape gardener and critic of pictures and works of art <\s>
<s> on hearing this i could not but remember how his qualifications for the second were proved by the surprising variety of natural beauties he managed to display to their best advantage from the very circumscribed limits of the garden at rydal mount an invisible hand of art everywhere working to use his own exquisite expression in the very spirit of nature and how many there were who have owed the charm of their grounds and gardens to direction sought from his well known taste and feeling <\s>
<s> as to works of art his criticism was not that of one versed in the history of the schools but always proceeding upon first principles the prima philosophia as he called it and it was as it appeared to me of the highest order <\s>
<s> he was a very great admirer of virgil not so much as a creative poet but as the most consummate master of language that perhaps ever existed <\s>

<s> the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth <\s>

<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>

<s> one of the first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been he said his friend for more than thirty years <\s>
<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>
<s> it appeared that his death was a relief from intense pain which however subsided at the interval of a few days before the event and that shortly after this cessation of agony he fell into a comatose state <\s>
<s> the most interesting part of the letter was the statement that the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other relatives and friends around him to give them his blessing and to express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the depth of his trust in his saviour christ <\s>
<s> as i heard this i was at once deeply glad at the substance and deeply affected by wordsworth's emotion in reading it <\s>

<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>

<s> i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion <\s>
<s> he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual <\s>
<s> i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in after days the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element <\s>

<s> in the first stanza for where'er these casual eyes are cast which he objected to as not simple and natural and as scarcely correct he suggested where'er a casual look i cast and for converse the accent of which he condemned as belonging to the noun and not to the verb he suggested commune <\s>

<s> but to some others of southey's verses as well as to the lines above quoted and to his prose writings in general he was wont to give liberal praise and no one could doubt the sincerity and warmth of his admiration of the intellect and virtues of the man or the brotherly affection towards him which he not unfrequently expressed <\s>

<s> feeling very grateful to you for the pleasure which that visit gave me and desiring to make a more minute record of it than either the letter i addressed to you from keswick or my journal written at the time contains i gladly comply with your request <\s>
<s> it was about noon on the 18th of august 1849 that i set out with my friends from their house near bowness to ride to ambleside <\s>
<s> our route was along the shore of lake windermere <\s>
<s> it was my first day among the english lakes and i enjoyed keenly the loveliness which was spread out before me <\s>
<s> my friends congratulated me on the clearness of the atmosphere and the bright skies <\s>
<s> twilight is all important in bringing out the full beauty of the lake region and in this respect i was very fortunate <\s>
<s> i had already been deeply moved by the tranquil beauty of windermere for as i came out of the cottage formerly professor wilson's where i had passed the night there it lay in all its grandeur its clear waters its green islands and its girdle of solemn mountains <\s>
<s> it was quite dark when i had been conducted to this cottage the night before so that i saw the lake for the first time in the light of early morning <\s>
<s> the first impression was confirmed by every new prospect as we rode along <\s>
<s> the vale seemed a very paradise for its sweet seclusion <\s>
<s> i had been told that after switzerland i should find little to attract me in this region but such was not the case <\s>
<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>
<s> the foliage is of the darkest green giving to the lake in which it is reflected the same sombre hue <\s>
<s> it seemed the fittest dwelling place for a poet amid all this quiet beauty <\s>
<s> it was half past one when we reached ambleside where i left mr <\s>
<s> b and walked on alone to rydal mount <\s>
<s> i was full of eager expectations as i thought how soon i should perhaps be in the presence of wordsworth that after long years of waiting of distant reverential admiration and love i was as i hoped to be favoured with a personal interview with the great poet philosopher to whom you and i and so many many others feel that we are under the deepest obligation for the good which has come to us from his writings <\s>
<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>
<s> i walked along the gravel pathway leading through shrubbery to the open space in front of the long two story cottage the poet's dwelling <\s>
<s> your sketch of the house by inman is a correct one but it gives no idea of the view from it which is its chief charm <\s>
<s> rydal mere with its islands and the mountains beyond it are all in sight <\s>

<s> it was evident that the greatest attention had been paid to the grounds for the flower beds were tastefully arranged and the gravel walks were in complete order <\s>
<s> one might be well content i thought to make his abode at a spot like this <\s>

<s> my dear friend you have asked me to write out as fully as i can an account of my visit to wordsworth last summer of which your letter of introduction was the occasion <\s>
<s> feeling very grateful to you for the pleasure which that visit gave me and desiring to make a more minute record of it than either the letter i addressed to you from keswick or my journal written at the time contains i gladly comply with your request <\s>
<s> it was about noon on the 18th of august 1849 that i set out with my friends from their house near bowness to ride to ambleside <\s>
<s> our route was along the shore of lake windermere <\s>
<s> it was my first day among the english lakes and i enjoyed keenly the loveliness which was spread out before me <\s>
<s> my friends congratulated me on the clearness of the atmosphere and the bright skies <\s>
<s> twilight is all important in bringing out the full beauty of the lake region and in this respect i was very fortunate <\s>
<s> i had already been deeply moved by the tranquil beauty of windermere for as i came out of the cottage formerly professor wilson's where i had passed the night there it lay in all its grandeur its clear waters its green islands and its girdle of solemn mountains <\s>
<s> it was quite dark when i had been conducted to this cottage the night before so that i saw the lake for the first time in the light of early morning <\s>
<s> the first impression was confirmed by every new prospect as we rode along <\s>
<s> the vale seemed a very paradise for its sweet seclusion <\s>
<s> i had been told that after switzerland i should find little to attract me in this region but such was not the case <\s>
<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>
<s> the foliage is of the darkest green giving to the lake in which it is reflected the same sombre hue <\s>
<s> it seemed the fittest dwelling place for a poet amid all this quiet beauty <\s>
<s> it was half past one when we reached ambleside where i left mr <\s>
<s> b and walked on alone to rydal mount <\s>
<s> i was full of eager expectations as i thought how soon i should perhaps be in the presence of wordsworth that after long years of waiting of distant reverential admiration and love i was as i hoped to be favoured with a personal interview with the great poet philosopher to whom you and i and so many many others feel that we are under the deepest obligation for the good which has come to us from his writings <\s>
<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>
<s> i walked along the gravel pathway leading through shrubbery to the open space in front of the long two story cottage the poet's dwelling <\s>
<s> your sketch of the house by inman is a correct one but it gives no idea of the view from it which is its chief charm <\s>
<s> rydal mere with its islands and the mountains beyond it are all in sight <\s>
<s> i had but a hasty enjoyment of this beauty nor could i notice carefully the flowers which were blooming around <\s>
<s> it was evident that the greatest attention had been paid to the grounds for the flower beds were tastefully arranged and the gravel walks were in complete order <\s>
<s> one might be well content i thought to make his abode at a spot like this <\s>
<s> a boy of about twelve years was occupied at one of the flower beds as i passed by he followed me to the door and waited my commands <\s>
<s> i asked if mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth was in .... <\s>
<s> he was dining would i walk into the drawing room and wait a short time ... <\s>
<s> i was shown into the drawing room or study i know not which to call it .... <\s>
<s> here i am i said to myself in the great poet's house <\s>
<s> here his daily life is spent <\s>
<s> here in this room doubtless much of his poetry has been written words of power which are to go down with those of shakspeare and spenser and milton while our english tongue endures <\s>
<s> it was a long apartment the ceiling low with two windows at one end looking out on the lawn and shrubbery <\s>
<s> many engravings were on the walls <\s>
<s> the famous madonna of raphael known as that of the dresden gallery hung directly over the fire place <\s>
<s> attaching a full value to the singular yet easily imagined and most picturesque circumstances of the adventurer's position to the admirable painting of the scenes and to the knowledge displayed of the working of human feelings he yet felt sure that the intense interest created by the story arose chiefly from the extraordinary energy and resource of the hero under his difficult circumstances from their being so far beyond what it was natural to expect or what would have been exhibited by the average of men and that similarly the high pleasure derived from his successes and good fortunes arose from the peculiar source of these uncommon merits of his character <\s>
<s> i have heard him pronounce that the tragedy of othello plato's records of the last scenes of the career of socrates and isaac walton's life of george herbert were in his opinion the most pathetic of human compositions <\s>
<s> in a walk one day after stopping according to his custom to claim admiration for some happy aspect of the landscape or beautiful composition on a smaller scale of natural objects caught by him at the precisely best point of view in the midst of his conversation on other subjects he added good humouredly that there were three callings for success in which nature had furnished him with qualifications the callings of poet landscape gardener and critic of pictures and works of art <\s>
<s> on hearing this i could not but remember how his qualifications for the second were proved by the surprising variety of natural beauties he managed to display to their best advantage from the very circumscribed limits of the garden at rydal mount an invisible hand of art everywhere working to use his own exquisite expression in the very spirit of nature and how many there were who have owed the charm of their grounds and gardens to direction sought from his well known taste and feeling <\s>
<s> as to works of art his criticism was not that of one versed in the history of the schools but always proceeding upon first principles the prima philosophia as he called it and it was as it appeared to me of the highest order <\s>

<s> g on the death of coleridge <\s>
<s> the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth <\s>
<s> it was the sunday evening after the event occurred that my brother and i walked over to the mount where we found the poet alone <\s>
<s> one of the first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been he said his friend for more than thirty years <\s>
<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>
<s> it appeared that his death was a relief from intense pain which however subsided at the interval of a few days before the event and that shortly after this cessation of agony he fell into a comatose state <\s>
<s> the most interesting part of the letter was the statement that the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other relatives and friends around him to give them his blessing and to express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the depth of his trust in his saviour christ <\s>
<s> as i heard this i was at once deeply glad at the substance and deeply affected by wordsworth's emotion in reading it <\s>
<s> when he came to this part his voice at first faltered and then broke but soon divine faith that the change was a blest one overcame aught of human grief and he concluded in an equable though subdued tone <\s>
<s> before i quit this subject i will tell you what i was interested in hearing from a person of the highest abilities 266 whom i had the good fortune of meeting at rydal mount <\s>
<s> he said that he had visited coleridge about a month before his death and had perceived at once his countenance pervaded by a most remarkable serenity <\s>
<s> on being congratulated on his appearance coleridge replied that he did now for the first time begin to hope from the mitigation of his pains that his health was undergoing a permanent improvement alas <\s>
<s> he was deceived yet may we not consider this hopeful feeling which is i believe by no means uncommon to be under such circumstances a valuable blessing ); but that what he felt most thankful for was the deep calm peace of mind which he then enjoyed a peace such as he had never before experienced or scarcely hoped for <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>
<s> to the above memorandum i now sept <\s>
<s> 1874 add two items of which i retain a distinct remembrance <\s>
<s> 1 he was in favour of the officiating clergyman being allowed to introduce into his reading of the lessons in church the authorised marginal corrections <\s>
<s> 2 he expressed in very strong terms his opinion that the prefatory portion of the marriage service should be altered so as to make it not only less repulsive to modern feelings but more accordant with the higher aspects of the union to be solemnised <\s>
<s> passion in poetry one day speaking of passion as an element of poetry he referred to his own poems and said that he thought there was a stronger fire of passion than was elsewhere to be found among them in the lyrical burst near the conclusion of the song at the feast of brougham castle armour rusting in his halls on the blood of clifford calls quell the scot exclaims the lance bear me to the heart of france is the longing of the shield <\s>
<s> chronological classification of poems many years ago i expressed to wordsworth a wish that his poems were printed in the order of their composition assigning as reasons for the wish the great interest which would attach to observing the progressive development of the poet's thought and the interpretative value of the light mutually reflected by poems of the same period <\s>
<s> i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion <\s>
<s> he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual <\s>
<s> i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in after days the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element <\s>
<s> verbal criticism wordsworth not only sympathised with the feelings expressed in southey's touching lines upon the dead but admired very much the easy flow of the verse and the perfect freedom from strain in the expression by which they are marked <\s>
<s> yet in the first two stanzas he noted three flaws and suggested changes by which they might have been easily avoided <\s>
<s> i have underlined the words he took exception to my days among the dead are past around me i behold where'er these casual eyes are cast the mighty minds of old my never failing friends are they with whom i converse day by day <\s>
<s> with them i take delight in weal and seek relief in woe and while i understand and feel how much to them i owe my cheeks have often been bedew'd with tears of thoughtful gratitude <\s>
<s> in the first stanza for where'er these casual eyes are cast which he objected to as not simple and natural and as scarcely correct he suggested where'er a casual look i cast and for converse the accent of which he condemned as belonging to the noun and not to the verb he suggested commune <\s>
<s> in the second stanza he pointed out the improper sequence of tenses in the third and fifth lines which he corrected by reading in the latter my cheeks are oftentimes bedew'd <\s>
<s> of the narrative poems of his friend well executed as he considered them and of the mainly external action of imagination or fancy in which they deal i have certainly heard him pronounce a very depreciatory opinion whether i ever heard him use the hard words attributed to him i would not give five shillings for a ream of them i cannot now assert but if used they were said in reference to the nobler kind of imaginative power which reveals to man the deep places and sublimer affinities of his own being <\s>
<s> but to some others of southey's verses as well as to the lines above quoted and to his prose writings in general he was wont to give liberal praise and no one could doubt the sincerity and warmth of his admiration of the intellect and virtues of the man or the brotherly affection towards him which he not unfrequently expressed <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>

<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>

<s> the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth <\s>
<s> it was the sunday evening after the event occurred that my brother and i walked over to the mount where we found the poet alone <\s>
<s> one of the first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been he said his friend for more than thirty years <\s>
<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>
<s> it appeared that his death was a relief from intense pain which however subsided at the interval of a few days before the event and that shortly after this cessation of agony he fell into a comatose state <\s>
<s> the most interesting part of the letter was the statement that the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other relatives and friends around him to give them his blessing and to express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the depth of his trust in his saviour christ <\s>
<s> as i heard this i was at once deeply glad at the substance and deeply affected by wordsworth's emotion in reading it <\s>
<s> when he came to this part his voice at first faltered and then broke but soon divine faith that the change was a blest one overcame aught of human grief and he concluded in an equable though subdued tone <\s>
<s> before i quit this subject i will tell you what i was interested in hearing from a person of the highest abilities 266 whom i had the good fortune of meeting at rydal mount <\s>
<s> he said that he had visited coleridge about a month before his death and had perceived at once his countenance pervaded by a most remarkable serenity <\s>
<s> on being congratulated on his appearance coleridge replied that he did now for the first time begin to hope from the mitigation of his pains that his health was undergoing a permanent improvement alas <\s>
<s> he was deceived yet may we not consider this hopeful feeling which is i believe by no means uncommon to be under such circumstances a valuable blessing ); but that what he felt most thankful for was the deep calm peace of mind which he then enjoyed a peace such as he had never before experienced or scarcely hoped for <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>

<s> 1874 add two items of which i retain a distinct remembrance <\s>

<s> passion in poetry one day speaking of passion as an element of poetry he referred to his own poems and said that he thought there was a stronger fire of passion than was elsewhere to be found among them in the lyrical burst near the conclusion of the song at the feast of brougham castle armour rusting in his halls on the blood of clifford calls quell the scot exclaims the lance bear me to the heart of france is the longing of the shield <\s>

<s> i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion <\s>
<s> he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual <\s>
<s> i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in after days the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element <\s>

<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>

<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>

<s> here his daily life is spent <\s>
<s> here in this room doubtless much of his poetry has been written words of power which are to go down with those of shakspeare and spenser and milton while our english tongue endures <\s>

<s> attaching a full value to the singular yet easily imagined and most picturesque circumstances of the adventurer's position to the admirable painting of the scenes and to the knowledge displayed of the working of human feelings he yet felt sure that the intense interest created by the story arose chiefly from the extraordinary energy and resource of the hero under his difficult circumstances from their being so far beyond what it was natural to expect or what would have been exhibited by the average of men and that similarly the high pleasure derived from his successes and good fortunes arose from the peculiar source of these uncommon merits of his character <\s>
<s> i have heard him pronounce that the tragedy of othello plato's records of the last scenes of the career of socrates and isaac walton's life of george herbert were in his opinion the most pathetic of human compositions <\s>
<s> in a walk one day after stopping according to his custom to claim admiration for some happy aspect of the landscape or beautiful composition on a smaller scale of natural objects caught by him at the precisely best point of view in the midst of his conversation on other subjects he added good humouredly that there were three callings for success in which nature had furnished him with qualifications the callings of poet landscape gardener and critic of pictures and works of art <\s>
<s> on hearing this i could not but remember how his qualifications for the second were proved by the surprising variety of natural beauties he managed to display to their best advantage from the very circumscribed limits of the garden at rydal mount an invisible hand of art everywhere working to use his own exquisite expression in the very spirit of nature and how many there were who have owed the charm of their grounds and gardens to direction sought from his well known taste and feeling <\s>
<s> as to works of art his criticism was not that of one versed in the history of the schools but always proceeding upon first principles the prima philosophia as he called it and it was as it appeared to me of the highest order <\s>
<s> he was a very great admirer of virgil not so much as a creative poet but as the most consummate master of language that perhaps ever existed <\s>

<s> the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth <\s>

<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>

<s> one of the first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been he said his friend for more than thirty years <\s>
<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>
<s> it appeared that his death was a relief from intense pain which however subsided at the interval of a few days before the event and that shortly after this cessation of agony he fell into a comatose state <\s>
<s> the most interesting part of the letter was the statement that the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other relatives and friends around him to give them his blessing and to express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the depth of his trust in his saviour christ <\s>
<s> as i heard this i was at once deeply glad at the substance and deeply affected by wordsworth's emotion in reading it <\s>

<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>

<s> i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion <\s>
<s> he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual <\s>
<s> i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in after days the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element <\s>

<s> in the first stanza for where'er these casual eyes are cast which he objected to as not simple and natural and as scarcely correct he suggested where'er a casual look i cast and for converse the accent of which he condemned as belonging to the noun and not to the verb he suggested commune <\s>

<s> but to some others of southey's verses as well as to the lines above quoted and to his prose writings in general he was wont to give liberal praise and no one could doubt the sincerity and warmth of his admiration of the intellect and virtues of the man or the brotherly affection towards him which he not unfrequently expressed <\s>

<s> feeling very grateful to you for the pleasure which that visit gave me and desiring to make a more minute record of it than either the letter i addressed to you from keswick or my journal written at the time contains i gladly comply with your request <\s>
<s> it was about noon on the 18th of august 1849 that i set out with my friends from their house near bowness to ride to ambleside <\s>
<s> our route was along the shore of lake windermere <\s>
<s> it was my first day among the english lakes and i enjoyed keenly the loveliness which was spread out before me <\s>
<s> my friends congratulated me on the clearness of the atmosphere and the bright skies <\s>
<s> twilight is all important in bringing out the full beauty of the lake region and in this respect i was very fortunate <\s>
<s> i had already been deeply moved by the tranquil beauty of windermere for as i came out of the cottage formerly professor wilson's where i had passed the night there it lay in all its grandeur its clear waters its green islands and its girdle of solemn mountains <\s>
<s> it was quite dark when i had been conducted to this cottage the night before so that i saw the lake for the first time in the light of early morning <\s>
<s> the first impression was confirmed by every new prospect as we rode along <\s>
<s> the vale seemed a very paradise for its sweet seclusion <\s>
<s> i had been told that after switzerland i should find little to attract me in this region but such was not the case <\s>
<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>
<s> the foliage is of the darkest green giving to the lake in which it is reflected the same sombre hue <\s>
<s> it seemed the fittest dwelling place for a poet amid all this quiet beauty <\s>
<s> it was half past one when we reached ambleside where i left mr <\s>
<s> b and walked on alone to rydal mount <\s>
<s> i was full of eager expectations as i thought how soon i should perhaps be in the presence of wordsworth that after long years of waiting of distant reverential admiration and love i was as i hoped to be favoured with a personal interview with the great poet philosopher to whom you and i and so many many others feel that we are under the deepest obligation for the good which has come to us from his writings <\s>
<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>
<s> i walked along the gravel pathway leading through shrubbery to the open space in front of the long two story cottage the poet's dwelling <\s>
<s> your sketch of the house by inman is a correct one but it gives no idea of the view from it which is its chief charm <\s>
<s> rydal mere with its islands and the mountains beyond it are all in sight <\s>

<s> it was evident that the greatest attention had been paid to the grounds for the flower beds were tastefully arranged and the gravel walks were in complete order <\s>
<s> one might be well content i thought to make his abode at a spot like this <\s>

<s> my dear friend you have asked me to write out as fully as i can an account of my visit to wordsworth last summer of which your letter of introduction was the occasion <\s>
<s> feeling very grateful to you for the pleasure which that visit gave me and desiring to make a more minute record of it than either the letter i addressed to you from keswick or my journal written at the time contains i gladly comply with your request <\s>
<s> it was about noon on the 18th of august 1849 that i set out with my friends from their house near bowness to ride to ambleside <\s>
<s> our route was along the shore of lake windermere <\s>
<s> it was my first day among the english lakes and i enjoyed keenly the loveliness which was spread out before me <\s>
<s> my friends congratulated me on the clearness of the atmosphere and the bright skies <\s>
<s> twilight is all important in bringing out the full beauty of the lake region and in this respect i was very fortunate <\s>
<s> i had already been deeply moved by the tranquil beauty of windermere for as i came out of the cottage formerly professor wilson's where i had passed the night there it lay in all its grandeur its clear waters its green islands and its girdle of solemn mountains <\s>
<s> it was quite dark when i had been conducted to this cottage the night before so that i saw the lake for the first time in the light of early morning <\s>
<s> the first impression was confirmed by every new prospect as we rode along <\s>
<s> the vale seemed a very paradise for its sweet seclusion <\s>
<s> i had been told that after switzerland i should find little to attract me in this region but such was not the case <\s>
<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>
<s> the foliage is of the darkest green giving to the lake in which it is reflected the same sombre hue <\s>
<s> it seemed the fittest dwelling place for a poet amid all this quiet beauty <\s>
<s> it was half past one when we reached ambleside where i left mr <\s>
<s> b and walked on alone to rydal mount <\s>
<s> i was full of eager expectations as i thought how soon i should perhaps be in the presence of wordsworth that after long years of waiting of distant reverential admiration and love i was as i hoped to be favoured with a personal interview with the great poet philosopher to whom you and i and so many many others feel that we are under the deepest obligation for the good which has come to us from his writings <\s>
<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>
<s> i walked along the gravel pathway leading through shrubbery to the open space in front of the long two story cottage the poet's dwelling <\s>
<s> your sketch of the house by inman is a correct one but it gives no idea of the view from it which is its chief charm <\s>
<s> rydal mere with its islands and the mountains beyond it are all in sight <\s>
<s> i had but a hasty enjoyment of this beauty nor could i notice carefully the flowers which were blooming around <\s>
<s> it was evident that the greatest attention had been paid to the grounds for the flower beds were tastefully arranged and the gravel walks were in complete order <\s>
<s> one might be well content i thought to make his abode at a spot like this <\s>
<s> a boy of about twelve years was occupied at one of the flower beds as i passed by he followed me to the door and waited my commands <\s>
<s> i asked if mr <\s>
<s> wordsworth was in .... <\s>
<s> he was dining would i walk into the drawing room and wait a short time ... <\s>
<s> i was shown into the drawing room or study i know not which to call it .... <\s>
<s> here i am i said to myself in the great poet's house <\s>
<s> here his daily life is spent <\s>
<s> here in this room doubtless much of his poetry has been written words of power which are to go down with those of shakspeare and spenser and milton while our english tongue endures <\s>
<s> it was a long apartment the ceiling low with two windows at one end looking out on the lawn and shrubbery <\s>
<s> many engravings were on the walls <\s>
<s> the famous madonna of raphael known as that of the dresden gallery hung directly over the fire place <\s>
<s> attaching a full value to the singular yet easily imagined and most picturesque circumstances of the adventurer's position to the admirable painting of the scenes and to the knowledge displayed of the working of human feelings he yet felt sure that the intense interest created by the story arose chiefly from the extraordinary energy and resource of the hero under his difficult circumstances from their being so far beyond what it was natural to expect or what would have been exhibited by the average of men and that similarly the high pleasure derived from his successes and good fortunes arose from the peculiar source of these uncommon merits of his character <\s>
<s> i have heard him pronounce that the tragedy of othello plato's records of the last scenes of the career of socrates and isaac walton's life of george herbert were in his opinion the most pathetic of human compositions <\s>
<s> in a walk one day after stopping according to his custom to claim admiration for some happy aspect of the landscape or beautiful composition on a smaller scale of natural objects caught by him at the precisely best point of view in the midst of his conversation on other subjects he added good humouredly that there were three callings for success in which nature had furnished him with qualifications the callings of poet landscape gardener and critic of pictures and works of art <\s>
<s> on hearing this i could not but remember how his qualifications for the second were proved by the surprising variety of natural beauties he managed to display to their best advantage from the very circumscribed limits of the garden at rydal mount an invisible hand of art everywhere working to use his own exquisite expression in the very spirit of nature and how many there were who have owed the charm of their grounds and gardens to direction sought from his well known taste and feeling <\s>
<s> as to works of art his criticism was not that of one versed in the history of the schools but always proceeding upon first principles the prima philosophia as he called it and it was as it appeared to me of the highest order <\s>

<s> g on the death of coleridge <\s>
<s> the death of coleridge was announced to us by his friend wordsworth <\s>
<s> it was the sunday evening after the event occurred that my brother and i walked over to the mount where we found the poet alone <\s>
<s> one of the first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been he said his friend for more than thirty years <\s>
<s> he then continued to speak of him called him the most wonderful man that he had ever known wonderful for the originality of his mind and the power he possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which might be evolved the most comprehensive systems <\s>
<s> wordsworth as a poet regretted that german metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of coleridge for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject whereas if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the literature and to influence the thought of the nation than any man of the age <\s>
<s> as it was however he said he believed coleridge's mind to have been a widely fertilising one and that the seed he had so lavishly sown in his conversational discourses and the sibylline leaves not the poems so called by him which he had scattered abroad so extensively covered with his annotations had done much to form the opinions of the highest educated men of the day although this might be an influence not likely to meet with adequate recognition <\s>
<s> after mentioning in answer to our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship that though a considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of each other coleridge and he had been for more than two years uninterruptedly in as close intimacy as man could be with man he proceeded to read to us the letter from henry nelson coleridge which conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death and of the manner of it <\s>
<s> it appeared that his death was a relief from intense pain which however subsided at the interval of a few days before the event and that shortly after this cessation of agony he fell into a comatose state <\s>
<s> the most interesting part of the letter was the statement that the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other relatives and friends around him to give them his blessing and to express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the depth of his trust in his saviour christ <\s>
<s> as i heard this i was at once deeply glad at the substance and deeply affected by wordsworth's emotion in reading it <\s>
<s> when he came to this part his voice at first faltered and then broke but soon divine faith that the change was a blest one overcame aught of human grief and he concluded in an equable though subdued tone <\s>
<s> before i quit this subject i will tell you what i was interested in hearing from a person of the highest abilities 266 whom i had the good fortune of meeting at rydal mount <\s>
<s> he said that he had visited coleridge about a month before his death and had perceived at once his countenance pervaded by a most remarkable serenity <\s>
<s> on being congratulated on his appearance coleridge replied that he did now for the first time begin to hope from the mitigation of his pains that his health was undergoing a permanent improvement alas <\s>
<s> he was deceived yet may we not consider this hopeful feeling which is i believe by no means uncommon to be under such circumstances a valuable blessing ); but that what he felt most thankful for was the deep calm peace of mind which he then enjoyed a peace such as he had never before experienced or scarcely hoped for <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>
<s> to the above memorandum i now sept <\s>
<s> 1874 add two items of which i retain a distinct remembrance <\s>
<s> 1 he was in favour of the officiating clergyman being allowed to introduce into his reading of the lessons in church the authorised marginal corrections <\s>
<s> 2 he expressed in very strong terms his opinion that the prefatory portion of the marriage service should be altered so as to make it not only less repulsive to modern feelings but more accordant with the higher aspects of the union to be solemnised <\s>
<s> passion in poetry one day speaking of passion as an element of poetry he referred to his own poems and said that he thought there was a stronger fire of passion than was elsewhere to be found among them in the lyrical burst near the conclusion of the song at the feast of brougham castle armour rusting in his halls on the blood of clifford calls quell the scot exclaims the lance bear me to the heart of france is the longing of the shield <\s>
<s> chronological classification of poems many years ago i expressed to wordsworth a wish that his poems were printed in the order of their composition assigning as reasons for the wish the great interest which would attach to observing the progressive development of the poet's thought and the interpretative value of the light mutually reflected by poems of the same period <\s>
<s> i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion <\s>
<s> he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual <\s>
<s> i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in after days the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element <\s>
<s> verbal criticism wordsworth not only sympathised with the feelings expressed in southey's touching lines upon the dead but admired very much the easy flow of the verse and the perfect freedom from strain in the expression by which they are marked <\s>
<s> yet in the first two stanzas he noted three flaws and suggested changes by which they might have been easily avoided <\s>
<s> i have underlined the words he took exception to my days among the dead are past around me i behold where'er these casual eyes are cast the mighty minds of old my never failing friends are they with whom i converse day by day <\s>
<s> with them i take delight in weal and seek relief in woe and while i understand and feel how much to them i owe my cheeks have often been bedew'd with tears of thoughtful gratitude <\s>
<s> in the first stanza for where'er these casual eyes are cast which he objected to as not simple and natural and as scarcely correct he suggested where'er a casual look i cast and for converse the accent of which he condemned as belonging to the noun and not to the verb he suggested commune <\s>
<s> in the second stanza he pointed out the improper sequence of tenses in the third and fifth lines which he corrected by reading in the latter my cheeks are oftentimes bedew'd <\s>
<s> of the narrative poems of his friend well executed as he considered them and of the mainly external action of imagination or fancy in which they deal i have certainly heard him pronounce a very depreciatory opinion whether i ever heard him use the hard words attributed to him i would not give five shillings for a ream of them i cannot now assert but if used they were said in reference to the nobler kind of imaginative power which reveals to man the deep places and sublimer affinities of his own being <\s>
<s> but to some others of southey's verses as well as to the lines above quoted and to his prose writings in general he was wont to give liberal praise and no one could doubt the sincerity and warmth of his admiration of the intellect and virtues of the man or the brotherly affection towards him which he not unfrequently expressed <\s>

<s> h further reminiscences of wordsworth by the same sent to the present editor <\s>
<s> i remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the wisdom of a plan suggested by wordsworth for the revision of the authorised version of the bible and of the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> with regard to the former no one he said could be more deeply convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was and being what it is <\s>
<s> in his opinion it was made at the happy juncture when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility and when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of technical distinctions and conventional refinements and these circumstances though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual influence of its subject matter he considered to be highly important in connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised standard of the language for thus the fresh well of english undefiled was made a perennial blessing to the nation in no slight degree conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its inhabitants <\s>
<s> he was satisfied too as to its general and most impartial accuracy and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the style the strength and the spirit and the character of the original records <\s>
<s> he attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which to the feelings of aged christians belonged to the ipsissima verba which had been their support under the trials of life <\s>
<s> and so with regard to the prayer book he reverenced and loved it as the church's precious heritage of primitive piety equally admirable for its matter and its style <\s>
<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>

<s> it may be interesting to add that in reference to this latter point i have heard him pronounce that many of the collects seemed to him examples of perfection consisting according to his impression of words whose signification filled up without excess or defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning and whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur a combination he added such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of shakespeare <\s>
<s> but notwithstanding that he held these opinions which will evince that he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume he did not think that plain mistakes in the translation of the bible or obsolete words or renderings commonly misunderstood should be perpetually handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration or that similar blemishes in the prayer book which as being of human composition would admit of freer though still reverential handling should be permitted to continue as stumbling blocks interfering with its acceptableness and usefulness <\s>
<s> the plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was the following that by proper authority a committee of revision of the english bible should be appointed whose business should be retaining the present authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made and have these printed in the margin of all bibles published by authority <\s>
<s> that as an essential part of the scheme this committee of revision should be renewed periodically but not too frequently he appeared to think that periods of fifty years might serve at which times it should be competent to the committee to authorise the transference from the margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of experience and criticism during the previous period as well as to fix on new marginal readings <\s>
<s> he was of opinion that in the constitution of the committee care should be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound theology and especially for their knowledge in connection with the original languages of the sacred volume but some one author at least noted for his mastery over the vernacular language <\s>
<s> it will be seen that this plan while it provides for corrections of errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken expressions leaves undisturbed the associations of aged christians and prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments into the text <\s>
<s> wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the period of revision was of great consequence both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning cancelling and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision <\s>
<s> the same process under certain modifications he thought applicable to the book of common prayer <\s>
<s> in this he deprecated all tampering with doctrine considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently used <\s>
<s> it is fair to add however that i have heard him express a strong desire that the athanasian creed were rid of the so called damnatory clauses at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the trinity <\s>
<s> he was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns more peculiarly christian in character than the psalter being set forth by authority for use in the church and for the choice of such hymns he thought a committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine of poet and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be severally and conjointly engaged <\s>
<s> as a practical suggestion of moment in the composition of such hymns he advised that composers should not in the four line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines rhyme leaving the other two unrhymed he said would give an important addition of freedom both to the sense and the style <\s>
<s> to the above memorandum i now sept <\s>
<s> 1874 add two items of which i retain a distinct remembrance <\s>
<s> 1 he was in favour of the officiating clergyman being allowed to introduce into his reading of the lessons in church the authorised marginal corrections <\s>
<s> 2 he expressed in very strong terms his opinion that the prefatory portion of the marriage service should be altered so as to make it not only less repulsive to modern feelings but more accordant with the higher aspects of the union to be solemnised <\s>
<s> passion in poetry one day speaking of passion as an element of poetry he referred to his own poems and said that he thought there was a stronger fire of passion than was elsewhere to be found among them in the lyrical burst near the conclusion of the song at the feast of brougham castle armour rusting in his halls on the blood of clifford calls quell the scot exclaims the lance bear me to the heart of france is the longing of the shield <\s>
<s> chronological classification of poems many years ago i expressed to wordsworth a wish that his poems were printed in the order of their composition assigning as reasons for the wish the great interest which would attach to observing the progressive development of the poet's thought and the interpretative value of the light mutually reflected by poems of the same period <\s>
<s> i remember being surprised by the feeling akin to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion <\s>
<s> he said that such proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by him which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of poetry in their right proportion and designing to bring to bear upon the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way best calculated to make them effectual <\s>
<s> i felt that his ground of objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet yet i retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as i had been suggesting and i welcomed in after days the concession made by him in consenting to put dates to the poems while adhering to their classification according to subject or predominant element <\s>
<s> verbal criticism wordsworth not only sympathised with the feelings expressed in southey's touching lines upon the dead but admired very much the easy flow of the verse and the perfect freedom from strain in the expression by which they are marked <\s>
<s> yet in the first two stanzas he noted three flaws and suggested changes by which they might have been easily avoided <\s>
<s> i have underlined the words he took exception to my days among the dead are past around me i behold where'er these casual eyes are cast the mighty minds of old my never failing friends are they with whom i converse day by day <\s>
<s> with them i take delight in weal and seek relief in woe and while i understand and feel how much to them i owe my cheeks have often been bedew'd with tears of thoughtful gratitude <\s>
<s> in the first stanza for where'er these casual eyes are cast which he objected to as not simple and natural and as scarcely correct he suggested where'er a casual look i cast and for converse the accent of which he condemned as belonging to the noun and not to the verb he suggested commune <\s>
<s> in the second stanza he pointed out the improper sequence of tenses in the third and fifth lines which he corrected by reading in the latter my cheeks are oftentimes bedew'd <\s>
<s> of the narrative poems of his friend well executed as he considered them and of the mainly external action of imagination or fancy in which they deal i have certainly heard him pronounce a very depreciatory opinion whether i ever heard him use the hard words attributed to him i would not give five shillings for a ream of them i cannot now assert but if used they were said in reference to the nobler kind of imaginative power which reveals to man the deep places and sublimer affinities of his own being <\s>
<s> but to some others of southey's verses as well as to the lines above quoted and to his prose writings in general he was wont to give liberal praise and no one could doubt the sincerity and warmth of his admiration of the intellect and virtues of the man or the brotherly affection towards him which he not unfrequently expressed <\s>

<s> my dear friend you have asked me to write out as fully as i can an account of my visit to wordsworth last summer of which your letter of introduction was the occasion <\s>
<s> feeling very grateful to you for the pleasure which that visit gave me and desiring to make a more minute record of it than either the letter i addressed to you from keswick or my journal written at the time contains i gladly comply with your request <\s>
<s> it was about noon on the 18th of august 1849 that i set out with my friends from their house near bowness to ride to ambleside <\s>
<s> our route was along the shore of lake windermere <\s>
<s> it was my first day among the english lakes and i enjoyed keenly the loveliness which was spread out before me <\s>
<s> my friends congratulated me on the clearness of the atmosphere and the bright skies <\s>
<s> twilight is all important in bringing out the full beauty of the lake region and in this respect i was very fortunate <\s>
<s> i had already been deeply moved by the tranquil beauty of windermere for as i came out of the cottage formerly professor wilson's where i had passed the night there it lay in all its grandeur its clear waters its green islands and its girdle of solemn mountains <\s>
<s> it was quite dark when i had been conducted to this cottage the night before so that i saw the lake for the first time in the light of early morning <\s>
<s> the first impression was confirmed by every new prospect as we rode along <\s>
<s> the vale seemed a very paradise for its sweet seclusion <\s>
<s> i had been told that after switzerland i should find little to attract me in this region but such was not the case <\s>
<s> nothing can be more lovely than these lakes and mountains the latter thickly wooded and rising directly from the water's edge <\s>
<s> the foliage is of the darkest green giving to the lake in which it is reflected the same sombre hue <\s>
<s> it seemed the fittest dwelling place for a poet amid all this quiet beauty <\s>
<s> it was half past one when we reached ambleside where i left mr <\s>
<s> b and walked on alone to rydal mount <\s>
<s> i was full of eager expectations as i thought how soon i should perhaps be in the presence of wordsworth that after long years of waiting of distant reverential admiration and love i was as i hoped to be favoured with a personal interview with the great poet philosopher to whom you and i and so many many others feel that we are under the deepest obligation for the good which has come to us from his writings <\s>
<s> at two o'clock i was at the wicket gate opening into wordsworth's grounds <\s>
<s> i walked along the gravel pathway leading through shrubbery to the open space in front of the long two story cottage the poet's dwelling <\s>
<s> your sketch of the house by inman is a correct one but it gives no idea of the view from it which is its chief charm <\s>
<s> rydal mere with its islands and the mountains beyond it are all in sight <\s>
<s> i had but a hasty enjoyment of this beauty nor could i notice carefully the flowers which were blooming around <\s>
<s> it was evident that the greatest attention had been paid to the grounds for the flower beds were tastefully arranged and the gravel walks were in complete order <\s>
<s> one might be well content i thought to make his abode at a spot like this <\s>
<s> a boy of about twelve years was occupied at one of the flower beds as i passed by he followed me to the door and waited my commands <\s>
<s> i asked if mr <\s>

<s> i was shown into the drawing room or study i know not which to call it .... <\s>
<s> here i am i said to myself in the great poet's house <\s>
<s> here his daily life is spent <\s>
<s> here in this room doubtless much of his poetry has been written words of power which are to go down with those of shakspeare and spenser and milton while our english tongue endures <\s>

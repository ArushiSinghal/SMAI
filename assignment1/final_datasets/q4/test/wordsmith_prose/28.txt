<s> ecclesiastical sonnets in series <\s>
<s> during the month of december 1820 i accompanied a much beloved and honoured friend in a walk through different parts of his estate with a view to fix upon the site of a new church which he intended to erect <\s>
<s> it was one of the most beautiful mornings of a mild season our feelings were in harmony with the cherishing influences of the scene and such being our purpose we were naturally led to look back upon past events with wonder and gratitude and on the future with hope <\s>
<s> not long afterwards some of the sonnets which will be found towards the close of this series were produced as a private memorial of that morning's occupation <\s>
<s> the catholic question which was agitated in parliament about that time kept my thoughts in the same course and it struck me that certain points in the ecclesiastical history of our country might advantageously be presented to view in verse <\s>
<s> accordingly i took up the subject and what i now offer to the reader was the result <\s>
<s> when this work was far advanced i was agreeably surprised to find that my friend mr <\s>

<s> if our productions thus unintentionally coinciding shall be found to illustrate each other it will prove a high gratification to me which i am sure my friend will participate <\s>
<s> rydal mount january 24 1822 <\s>
<s> for the convenience of passing from one point of the subject to another without shocks of abruptness this work has taken the shape of a series of sonnets but the reader it is to be hoped will find that the pictures are often so closely connected as to have jointly the effect of passages of a poem in a form of stanza to which there is no objection but one that bears upon the poet only its difficulty <\s>
<s> my purpose in writing this series was as much as possible to confine my view to the introduction progress and operation of the church in england both previous and subsequent to the reformation <\s>
<s> the sonnets were written long before ecclesiastical history and points of doctrine had excited the interest with which they have been recently enquired into and discussed <\s>
<s> the former particular is mentioned as an excuse for my having fallen into error in respect to an incident which had been selected as setting forth the height to which the power of the popedom over temporal sovereignty had attained and the arrogance with which it was displayed <\s>
<s> i allude to the last sonnet but one in the first series where pope alexander the third at venice is described as setting his foot on the neck of the emperor barbarossa <\s>
<s> though this is related as a fact in history i am told it is a mere legend of no authority <\s>
<s> substitute for it an undeniable truth not less fitted for my purpose namely the penance inflicted by gregory the seventh upon the emperor henry the fourth at canosa 4 4 according to baronius the humiliation of the emperor was a voluntary act of prostration on his part <\s>
<s> 111 before i conclude my notice of these sonnets let me observe that the opinion i pronounced in favour of laud long before the oxford tract movement and which had brought censure upon me from several quarters is not in the least changed <\s>
<s> omitting here to examine into his conduct in respect to the persecuting spirit with which he has been charged i am persuaded that most of his aims to restore ritual practices which had been abandoned were good and wise whatever errors he might commit in the manner he sometimes attempted to enforce them <\s>
<s> i further believe that had not he and others who shared his opinions and felt as he did stood up in opposition to the reformers of that period it is questionable whether the church would ever have recovered its lost ground and become the blessing it now is and will i trust become in a still greater degree both to those of its communion and those who unfortunately are separated from it 1 saw the figure of a lovely maid <\s>
<s> part iii when i came to this part of the series i had the dream described in this sonnet <\s>

<s> the sonnet was composed on the middle road leading from grasmere to ambleside it was begun as i left the last house in the vale and finished word for word as it now stands before i came in view of rydal <\s>
<s> i wish i could say the same of the five or six hundred i have written most of them were frequently retouched in the course of composition and not a few laboriously <\s>
<s> i have only further to observe that the intended church which prompted these sonnets was erected on coleorton moor towards the centre of a very populous parish between three and four miles from ashby de la zouch on the road to loughborough and has proved i believe a great benefit to the neighbourhood <\s>

<s> during the month of december 1820 i accompanied a much beloved and honoured friend in a walk through different parts of his estate with a view to fix upon the site of a new church which he intended to erect <\s>
<s> it was one of the most beautiful mornings of a mild season our feelings were in harmony with the cherishing influences of the scene and such being our purpose we were naturally led to look back upon past events with wonder and gratitude and on the future with hope <\s>
<s> not long afterwards some of the sonnets which will be found towards the close of this series were produced as a private memorial of that morning's occupation <\s>
<s> the catholic question which was agitated in parliament about that time kept my thoughts in the same course and it struck me that certain points in the ecclesiastical history of our country might advantageously be presented to view in verse <\s>
<s> accordingly i took up the subject and what i now offer to the reader was the result <\s>

<s> rydal mount january 24 1822 <\s>
<s> for the convenience of passing from one point of the subject to another without shocks of abruptness this work has taken the shape of a series of sonnets but the reader it is to be hoped will find that the pictures are often so closely connected as to have jointly the effect of passages of a poem in a form of stanza to which there is no objection but one that bears upon the poet only its difficulty <\s>
<s> my purpose in writing this series was as much as possible to confine my view to the introduction progress and operation of the church in england both previous and subsequent to the reformation <\s>
<s> the sonnets were written long before ecclesiastical history and points of doctrine had excited the interest with which they have been recently enquired into and discussed <\s>
<s> the former particular is mentioned as an excuse for my having fallen into error in respect to an incident which had been selected as setting forth the height to which the power of the popedom over temporal sovereignty had attained and the arrogance with which it was displayed <\s>
<s> i allude to the last sonnet but one in the first series where pope alexander the third at venice is described as setting his foot on the neck of the emperor barbarossa <\s>

<s> omitting here to examine into his conduct in respect to the persecuting spirit with which he has been charged i am persuaded that most of his aims to restore ritual practices which had been abandoned were good and wise whatever errors he might commit in the manner he sometimes attempted to enforce them <\s>
<s> i further believe that had not he and others who shared his opinions and felt as he did stood up in opposition to the reformers of that period it is questionable whether the church would ever have recovered its lost ground and become the blessing it now is and will i trust become in a still greater degree both to those of its communion and those who unfortunately are separated from it 1 saw the figure of a lovely maid <\s>

<s> i wish i could say the same of the five or six hundred i have written most of them were frequently retouched in the course of composition and not a few laboriously <\s>
<s> i have only further to observe that the intended church which prompted these sonnets was erected on coleorton moor towards the centre of a very populous parish between three and four miles from ashby de la zouch on the road to loughborough and has proved i believe a great benefit to the neighbourhood <\s>

<s> during the month of december 1820 i accompanied a much beloved and honoured friend in a walk through different parts of his estate with a view to fix upon the site of a new church which he intended to erect <\s>
<s> it was one of the most beautiful mornings of a mild season our feelings were in harmony with the cherishing influences of the scene and such being our purpose we were naturally led to look back upon past events with wonder and gratitude and on the future with hope <\s>
<s> not long afterwards some of the sonnets which will be found towards the close of this series were produced as a private memorial of that morning's occupation <\s>
<s> the catholic question which was agitated in parliament about that time kept my thoughts in the same course and it struck me that certain points in the ecclesiastical history of our country might advantageously be presented to view in verse <\s>

<s> rydal mount january 24 1822 <\s>
<s> for the convenience of passing from one point of the subject to another without shocks of abruptness this work has taken the shape of a series of sonnets but the reader it is to be hoped will find that the pictures are often so closely connected as to have jointly the effect of passages of a poem in a form of stanza to which there is no objection but one that bears upon the poet only its difficulty <\s>
<s> my purpose in writing this series was as much as possible to confine my view to the introduction progress and operation of the church in england both previous and subsequent to the reformation <\s>

<s> the former particular is mentioned as an excuse for my having fallen into error in respect to an incident which had been selected as setting forth the height to which the power of the popedom over temporal sovereignty had attained and the arrogance with which it was displayed <\s>

<s> omitting here to examine into his conduct in respect to the persecuting spirit with which he has been charged i am persuaded that most of his aims to restore ritual practices which had been abandoned were good and wise whatever errors he might commit in the manner he sometimes attempted to enforce them <\s>
<s> i further believe that had not he and others who shared his opinions and felt as he did stood up in opposition to the reformers of that period it is questionable whether the church would ever have recovered its lost ground and become the blessing it now is and will i trust become in a still greater degree both to those of its communion and those who unfortunately are separated from it 1 saw the figure of a lovely maid <\s>

<s> during the month of december 1820 i accompanied a much beloved and honoured friend in a walk through different parts of his estate with a view to fix upon the site of a new church which he intended to erect <\s>
<s> it was one of the most beautiful mornings of a mild season our feelings were in harmony with the cherishing influences of the scene and such being our purpose we were naturally led to look back upon past events with wonder and gratitude and on the future with hope <\s>
<s> not long afterwards some of the sonnets which will be found towards the close of this series were produced as a private memorial of that morning's occupation <\s>

<s> for the convenience of passing from one point of the subject to another without shocks of abruptness this work has taken the shape of a series of sonnets but the reader it is to be hoped will find that the pictures are often so closely connected as to have jointly the effect of passages of a poem in a form of stanza to which there is no objection but one that bears upon the poet only its difficulty <\s>
<s> my purpose in writing this series was as much as possible to confine my view to the introduction progress and operation of the church in england both previous and subsequent to the reformation <\s>
<s> the sonnets were written long before ecclesiastical history and points of doctrine had excited the interest with which they have been recently enquired into and discussed <\s>
<s> the former particular is mentioned as an excuse for my having fallen into error in respect to an incident which had been selected as setting forth the height to which the power of the popedom over temporal sovereignty had attained and the arrogance with which it was displayed <\s>

<s> omitting here to examine into his conduct in respect to the persecuting spirit with which he has been charged i am persuaded that most of his aims to restore ritual practices which had been abandoned were good and wise whatever errors he might commit in the manner he sometimes attempted to enforce them <\s>
<s> i further believe that had not he and others who shared his opinions and felt as he did stood up in opposition to the reformers of that period it is questionable whether the church would ever have recovered its lost ground and become the blessing it now is and will i trust become in a still greater degree both to those of its communion and those who unfortunately are separated from it 1 saw the figure of a lovely maid <\s>

<s> i wish i could say the same of the five or six hundred i have written most of them were frequently retouched in the course of composition and not a few laboriously <\s>
<s> i have only further to observe that the intended church which prompted these sonnets was erected on coleorton moor towards the centre of a very populous parish between three and four miles from ashby de la zouch on the road to loughborough and has proved i believe a great benefit to the neighbourhood <\s>

<s> during the month of december 1820 i accompanied a much beloved and honoured friend in a walk through different parts of his estate with a view to fix upon the site of a new church which he intended to erect <\s>
<s> it was one of the most beautiful mornings of a mild season our feelings were in harmony with the cherishing influences of the scene and such being our purpose we were naturally led to look back upon past events with wonder and gratitude and on the future with hope <\s>
<s> not long afterwards some of the sonnets which will be found towards the close of this series were produced as a private memorial of that morning's occupation <\s>
<s> the catholic question which was agitated in parliament about that time kept my thoughts in the same course and it struck me that certain points in the ecclesiastical history of our country might advantageously be presented to view in verse <\s>
<s> accordingly i took up the subject and what i now offer to the reader was the result <\s>

<s> rydal mount january 24 1822 <\s>
<s> for the convenience of passing from one point of the subject to another without shocks of abruptness this work has taken the shape of a series of sonnets but the reader it is to be hoped will find that the pictures are often so closely connected as to have jointly the effect of passages of a poem in a form of stanza to which there is no objection but one that bears upon the poet only its difficulty <\s>
<s> my purpose in writing this series was as much as possible to confine my view to the introduction progress and operation of the church in england both previous and subsequent to the reformation <\s>
<s> the sonnets were written long before ecclesiastical history and points of doctrine had excited the interest with which they have been recently enquired into and discussed <\s>
<s> the former particular is mentioned as an excuse for my having fallen into error in respect to an incident which had been selected as setting forth the height to which the power of the popedom over temporal sovereignty had attained and the arrogance with which it was displayed <\s>
<s> i allude to the last sonnet but one in the first series where pope alexander the third at venice is described as setting his foot on the neck of the emperor barbarossa <\s>

<s> omitting here to examine into his conduct in respect to the persecuting spirit with which he has been charged i am persuaded that most of his aims to restore ritual practices which had been abandoned were good and wise whatever errors he might commit in the manner he sometimes attempted to enforce them <\s>
<s> i further believe that had not he and others who shared his opinions and felt as he did stood up in opposition to the reformers of that period it is questionable whether the church would ever have recovered its lost ground and become the blessing it now is and will i trust become in a still greater degree both to those of its communion and those who unfortunately are separated from it 1 saw the figure of a lovely maid <\s>

<s> the sonnet was composed on the middle road leading from grasmere to ambleside it was begun as i left the last house in the vale and finished word for word as it now stands before i came in view of rydal <\s>
<s> i wish i could say the same of the five or six hundred i have written most of them were frequently retouched in the course of composition and not a few laboriously <\s>
<s> i have only further to observe that the intended church which prompted these sonnets was erected on coleorton moor towards the centre of a very populous parish between three and four miles from ashby de la zouch on the road to loughborough and has proved i believe a great benefit to the neighbourhood <\s>

<s> ecclesiastical sonnets in series <\s>
<s> during the month of december 1820 i accompanied a much beloved and honoured friend in a walk through different parts of his estate with a view to fix upon the site of a new church which he intended to erect <\s>
<s> it was one of the most beautiful mornings of a mild season our feelings were in harmony with the cherishing influences of the scene and such being our purpose we were naturally led to look back upon past events with wonder and gratitude and on the future with hope <\s>
<s> not long afterwards some of the sonnets which will be found towards the close of this series were produced as a private memorial of that morning's occupation <\s>
<s> the catholic question which was agitated in parliament about that time kept my thoughts in the same course and it struck me that certain points in the ecclesiastical history of our country might advantageously be presented to view in verse <\s>
<s> accordingly i took up the subject and what i now offer to the reader was the result <\s>
<s> when this work was far advanced i was agreeably surprised to find that my friend mr <\s>

<s> if our productions thus unintentionally coinciding shall be found to illustrate each other it will prove a high gratification to me which i am sure my friend will participate <\s>
<s> rydal mount january 24 1822 <\s>
<s> for the convenience of passing from one point of the subject to another without shocks of abruptness this work has taken the shape of a series of sonnets but the reader it is to be hoped will find that the pictures are often so closely connected as to have jointly the effect of passages of a poem in a form of stanza to which there is no objection but one that bears upon the poet only its difficulty <\s>
<s> my purpose in writing this series was as much as possible to confine my view to the introduction progress and operation of the church in england both previous and subsequent to the reformation <\s>
<s> the sonnets were written long before ecclesiastical history and points of doctrine had excited the interest with which they have been recently enquired into and discussed <\s>
<s> the former particular is mentioned as an excuse for my having fallen into error in respect to an incident which had been selected as setting forth the height to which the power of the popedom over temporal sovereignty had attained and the arrogance with which it was displayed <\s>
<s> i allude to the last sonnet but one in the first series where pope alexander the third at venice is described as setting his foot on the neck of the emperor barbarossa <\s>

<s> 111 before i conclude my notice of these sonnets let me observe that the opinion i pronounced in favour of laud long before the oxford tract movement and which had brought censure upon me from several quarters is not in the least changed <\s>
<s> omitting here to examine into his conduct in respect to the persecuting spirit with which he has been charged i am persuaded that most of his aims to restore ritual practices which had been abandoned were good and wise whatever errors he might commit in the manner he sometimes attempted to enforce them <\s>
<s> i further believe that had not he and others who shared his opinions and felt as he did stood up in opposition to the reformers of that period it is questionable whether the church would ever have recovered its lost ground and become the blessing it now is and will i trust become in a still greater degree both to those of its communion and those who unfortunately are separated from it 1 saw the figure of a lovely maid <\s>

<s> the sonnet was composed on the middle road leading from grasmere to ambleside it was begun as i left the last house in the vale and finished word for word as it now stands before i came in view of rydal <\s>
<s> i wish i could say the same of the five or six hundred i have written most of them were frequently retouched in the course of composition and not a few laboriously <\s>
<s> i have only further to observe that the intended church which prompted these sonnets was erected on coleorton moor towards the centre of a very populous parish between three and four miles from ashby de la zouch on the road to loughborough and has proved i believe a great benefit to the neighbourhood <\s>

<s> ecclesiastical sonnets in series <\s>
<s> during the month of december 1820 i accompanied a much beloved and honoured friend in a walk through different parts of his estate with a view to fix upon the site of a new church which he intended to erect <\s>
<s> it was one of the most beautiful mornings of a mild season our feelings were in harmony with the cherishing influences of the scene and such being our purpose we were naturally led to look back upon past events with wonder and gratitude and on the future with hope <\s>
<s> not long afterwards some of the sonnets which will be found towards the close of this series were produced as a private memorial of that morning's occupation <\s>
<s> the catholic question which was agitated in parliament about that time kept my thoughts in the same course and it struck me that certain points in the ecclesiastical history of our country might advantageously be presented to view in verse <\s>
<s> accordingly i took up the subject and what i now offer to the reader was the result <\s>
<s> when this work was far advanced i was agreeably surprised to find that my friend mr <\s>

<s> rydal mount january 24 1822 <\s>
<s> for the convenience of passing from one point of the subject to another without shocks of abruptness this work has taken the shape of a series of sonnets but the reader it is to be hoped will find that the pictures are often so closely connected as to have jointly the effect of passages of a poem in a form of stanza to which there is no objection but one that bears upon the poet only its difficulty <\s>
<s> my purpose in writing this series was as much as possible to confine my view to the introduction progress and operation of the church in england both previous and subsequent to the reformation <\s>
<s> the sonnets were written long before ecclesiastical history and points of doctrine had excited the interest with which they have been recently enquired into and discussed <\s>
<s> the former particular is mentioned as an excuse for my having fallen into error in respect to an incident which had been selected as setting forth the height to which the power of the popedom over temporal sovereignty had attained and the arrogance with which it was displayed <\s>
<s> i allude to the last sonnet but one in the first series where pope alexander the third at venice is described as setting his foot on the neck of the emperor barbarossa <\s>

<s> 111 before i conclude my notice of these sonnets let me observe that the opinion i pronounced in favour of laud long before the oxford tract movement and which had brought censure upon me from several quarters is not in the least changed <\s>
<s> omitting here to examine into his conduct in respect to the persecuting spirit with which he has been charged i am persuaded that most of his aims to restore ritual practices which had been abandoned were good and wise whatever errors he might commit in the manner he sometimes attempted to enforce them <\s>
<s> i further believe that had not he and others who shared his opinions and felt as he did stood up in opposition to the reformers of that period it is questionable whether the church would ever have recovered its lost ground and become the blessing it now is and will i trust become in a still greater degree both to those of its communion and those who unfortunately are separated from it 1 saw the figure of a lovely maid <\s>

<s> the sonnet was composed on the middle road leading from grasmere to ambleside it was begun as i left the last house in the vale and finished word for word as it now stands before i came in view of rydal <\s>
<s> i wish i could say the same of the five or six hundred i have written most of them were frequently retouched in the course of composition and not a few laboriously <\s>
<s> i have only further to observe that the intended church which prompted these sonnets was erected on coleorton moor towards the centre of a very populous parish between three and four miles from ashby de la zouch on the road to loughborough and has proved i believe a great benefit to the neighbourhood <\s>

<s> ecclesiastical sonnets in series <\s>
<s> during the month of december 1820 i accompanied a much beloved and honoured friend in a walk through different parts of his estate with a view to fix upon the site of a new church which he intended to erect <\s>
<s> it was one of the most beautiful mornings of a mild season our feelings were in harmony with the cherishing influences of the scene and such being our purpose we were naturally led to look back upon past events with wonder and gratitude and on the future with hope <\s>
<s> not long afterwards some of the sonnets which will be found towards the close of this series were produced as a private memorial of that morning's occupation <\s>
<s> the catholic question which was agitated in parliament about that time kept my thoughts in the same course and it struck me that certain points in the ecclesiastical history of our country might advantageously be presented to view in verse <\s>
<s> accordingly i took up the subject and what i now offer to the reader was the result <\s>
<s> when this work was far advanced i was agreeably surprised to find that my friend mr <\s>

<s> if our productions thus unintentionally coinciding shall be found to illustrate each other it will prove a high gratification to me which i am sure my friend will participate <\s>
<s> rydal mount january 24 1822 <\s>
<s> for the convenience of passing from one point of the subject to another without shocks of abruptness this work has taken the shape of a series of sonnets but the reader it is to be hoped will find that the pictures are often so closely connected as to have jointly the effect of passages of a poem in a form of stanza to which there is no objection but one that bears upon the poet only its difficulty <\s>
<s> my purpose in writing this series was as much as possible to confine my view to the introduction progress and operation of the church in england both previous and subsequent to the reformation <\s>
<s> the sonnets were written long before ecclesiastical history and points of doctrine had excited the interest with which they have been recently enquired into and discussed <\s>
<s> the former particular is mentioned as an excuse for my having fallen into error in respect to an incident which had been selected as setting forth the height to which the power of the popedom over temporal sovereignty had attained and the arrogance with which it was displayed <\s>
<s> i allude to the last sonnet but one in the first series where pope alexander the third at venice is described as setting his foot on the neck of the emperor barbarossa <\s>

<s> 111 before i conclude my notice of these sonnets let me observe that the opinion i pronounced in favour of laud long before the oxford tract movement and which had brought censure upon me from several quarters is not in the least changed <\s>
<s> omitting here to examine into his conduct in respect to the persecuting spirit with which he has been charged i am persuaded that most of his aims to restore ritual practices which had been abandoned were good and wise whatever errors he might commit in the manner he sometimes attempted to enforce them <\s>
<s> i further believe that had not he and others who shared his opinions and felt as he did stood up in opposition to the reformers of that period it is questionable whether the church would ever have recovered its lost ground and become the blessing it now is and will i trust become in a still greater degree both to those of its communion and those who unfortunately are separated from it 1 saw the figure of a lovely maid <\s>
<s> part iii when i came to this part of the series i had the dream described in this sonnet <\s>

<s> the sonnet was composed on the middle road leading from grasmere to ambleside it was begun as i left the last house in the vale and finished word for word as it now stands before i came in view of rydal <\s>
<s> i wish i could say the same of the five or six hundred i have written most of them were frequently retouched in the course of composition and not a few laboriously <\s>
<s> i have only further to observe that the intended church which prompted these sonnets was erected on coleorton moor towards the centre of a very populous parish between three and four miles from ashby de la zouch on the road to loughborough and has proved i believe a great benefit to the neighbourhood <\s>

<s> during the month of december 1820 i accompanied a much beloved and honoured friend in a walk through different parts of his estate with a view to fix upon the site of a new church which he intended to erect <\s>
<s> it was one of the most beautiful mornings of a mild season our feelings were in harmony with the cherishing influences of the scene and such being our purpose we were naturally led to look back upon past events with wonder and gratitude and on the future with hope <\s>
<s> not long afterwards some of the sonnets which will be found towards the close of this series were produced as a private memorial of that morning's occupation <\s>
<s> the catholic question which was agitated in parliament about that time kept my thoughts in the same course and it struck me that certain points in the ecclesiastical history of our country might advantageously be presented to view in verse <\s>
<s> accordingly i took up the subject and what i now offer to the reader was the result <\s>

<s> rydal mount january 24 1822 <\s>
<s> for the convenience of passing from one point of the subject to another without shocks of abruptness this work has taken the shape of a series of sonnets but the reader it is to be hoped will find that the pictures are often so closely connected as to have jointly the effect of passages of a poem in a form of stanza to which there is no objection but one that bears upon the poet only its difficulty <\s>
<s> my purpose in writing this series was as much as possible to confine my view to the introduction progress and operation of the church in england both previous and subsequent to the reformation <\s>
<s> the sonnets were written long before ecclesiastical history and points of doctrine had excited the interest with which they have been recently enquired into and discussed <\s>
<s> the former particular is mentioned as an excuse for my having fallen into error in respect to an incident which had been selected as setting forth the height to which the power of the popedom over temporal sovereignty had attained and the arrogance with which it was displayed <\s>
<s> i allude to the last sonnet but one in the first series where pope alexander the third at venice is described as setting his foot on the neck of the emperor barbarossa <\s>

<s> omitting here to examine into his conduct in respect to the persecuting spirit with which he has been charged i am persuaded that most of his aims to restore ritual practices which had been abandoned were good and wise whatever errors he might commit in the manner he sometimes attempted to enforce them <\s>
<s> i further believe that had not he and others who shared his opinions and felt as he did stood up in opposition to the reformers of that period it is questionable whether the church would ever have recovered its lost ground and become the blessing it now is and will i trust become in a still greater degree both to those of its communion and those who unfortunately are separated from it 1 saw the figure of a lovely maid <\s>
<s> part iii when i came to this part of the series i had the dream described in this sonnet <\s>

<s> i wish i could say the same of the five or six hundred i have written most of them were frequently retouched in the course of composition and not a few laboriously <\s>
<s> i have only further to observe that the intended church which prompted these sonnets was erected on coleorton moor towards the centre of a very populous parish between three and four miles from ashby de la zouch on the road to loughborough and has proved i believe a great benefit to the neighbourhood <\s>

<s> during the month of december 1820 i accompanied a much beloved and honoured friend in a walk through different parts of his estate with a view to fix upon the site of a new church which he intended to erect <\s>
<s> it was one of the most beautiful mornings of a mild season our feelings were in harmony with the cherishing influences of the scene and such being our purpose we were naturally led to look back upon past events with wonder and gratitude and on the future with hope <\s>
<s> not long afterwards some of the sonnets which will be found towards the close of this series were produced as a private memorial of that morning's occupation <\s>
<s> the catholic question which was agitated in parliament about that time kept my thoughts in the same course and it struck me that certain points in the ecclesiastical history of our country might advantageously be presented to view in verse <\s>
<s> accordingly i took up the subject and what i now offer to the reader was the result <\s>

<s> rydal mount january 24 1822 <\s>
<s> for the convenience of passing from one point of the subject to another without shocks of abruptness this work has taken the shape of a series of sonnets but the reader it is to be hoped will find that the pictures are often so closely connected as to have jointly the effect of passages of a poem in a form of stanza to which there is no objection but one that bears upon the poet only its difficulty <\s>
<s> my purpose in writing this series was as much as possible to confine my view to the introduction progress and operation of the church in england both previous and subsequent to the reformation <\s>
<s> the sonnets were written long before ecclesiastical history and points of doctrine had excited the interest with which they have been recently enquired into and discussed <\s>
<s> the former particular is mentioned as an excuse for my having fallen into error in respect to an incident which had been selected as setting forth the height to which the power of the popedom over temporal sovereignty had attained and the arrogance with which it was displayed <\s>
<s> i allude to the last sonnet but one in the first series where pope alexander the third at venice is described as setting his foot on the neck of the emperor barbarossa <\s>

<s> omitting here to examine into his conduct in respect to the persecuting spirit with which he has been charged i am persuaded that most of his aims to restore ritual practices which had been abandoned were good and wise whatever errors he might commit in the manner he sometimes attempted to enforce them <\s>
<s> i further believe that had not he and others who shared his opinions and felt as he did stood up in opposition to the reformers of that period it is questionable whether the church would ever have recovered its lost ground and become the blessing it now is and will i trust become in a still greater degree both to those of its communion and those who unfortunately are separated from it 1 saw the figure of a lovely maid <\s>

<s> i wish i could say the same of the five or six hundred i have written most of them were frequently retouched in the course of composition and not a few laboriously <\s>
<s> i have only further to observe that the intended church which prompted these sonnets was erected on coleorton moor towards the centre of a very populous parish between three and four miles from ashby de la zouch on the road to loughborough and has proved i believe a great benefit to the neighbourhood <\s>

<s> ecclesiastical sonnets in series <\s>
<s> during the month of december 1820 i accompanied a much beloved and honoured friend in a walk through different parts of his estate with a view to fix upon the site of a new church which he intended to erect <\s>
<s> it was one of the most beautiful mornings of a mild season our feelings were in harmony with the cherishing influences of the scene and such being our purpose we were naturally led to look back upon past events with wonder and gratitude and on the future with hope <\s>
<s> not long afterwards some of the sonnets which will be found towards the close of this series were produced as a private memorial of that morning's occupation <\s>
<s> the catholic question which was agitated in parliament about that time kept my thoughts in the same course and it struck me that certain points in the ecclesiastical history of our country might advantageously be presented to view in verse <\s>
<s> accordingly i took up the subject and what i now offer to the reader was the result <\s>
<s> when this work was far advanced i was agreeably surprised to find that my friend mr <\s>

<s> if our productions thus unintentionally coinciding shall be found to illustrate each other it will prove a high gratification to me which i am sure my friend will participate <\s>
<s> rydal mount january 24 1822 <\s>
<s> for the convenience of passing from one point of the subject to another without shocks of abruptness this work has taken the shape of a series of sonnets but the reader it is to be hoped will find that the pictures are often so closely connected as to have jointly the effect of passages of a poem in a form of stanza to which there is no objection but one that bears upon the poet only its difficulty <\s>
<s> my purpose in writing this series was as much as possible to confine my view to the introduction progress and operation of the church in england both previous and subsequent to the reformation <\s>
<s> the sonnets were written long before ecclesiastical history and points of doctrine had excited the interest with which they have been recently enquired into and discussed <\s>
<s> the former particular is mentioned as an excuse for my having fallen into error in respect to an incident which had been selected as setting forth the height to which the power of the popedom over temporal sovereignty had attained and the arrogance with which it was displayed <\s>
<s> i allude to the last sonnet but one in the first series where pope alexander the third at venice is described as setting his foot on the neck of the emperor barbarossa <\s>
<s> though this is related as a fact in history i am told it is a mere legend of no authority <\s>
<s> substitute for it an undeniable truth not less fitted for my purpose namely the penance inflicted by gregory the seventh upon the emperor henry the fourth at canosa 4 4 according to baronius the humiliation of the emperor was a voluntary act of prostration on his part <\s>
<s> 111 before i conclude my notice of these sonnets let me observe that the opinion i pronounced in favour of laud long before the oxford tract movement and which had brought censure upon me from several quarters is not in the least changed <\s>
<s> omitting here to examine into his conduct in respect to the persecuting spirit with which he has been charged i am persuaded that most of his aims to restore ritual practices which had been abandoned were good and wise whatever errors he might commit in the manner he sometimes attempted to enforce them <\s>
<s> i further believe that had not he and others who shared his opinions and felt as he did stood up in opposition to the reformers of that period it is questionable whether the church would ever have recovered its lost ground and become the blessing it now is and will i trust become in a still greater degree both to those of its communion and those who unfortunately are separated from it 1 saw the figure of a lovely maid <\s>
<s> part iii when i came to this part of the series i had the dream described in this sonnet <\s>

<s> the sonnet was composed on the middle road leading from grasmere to ambleside it was begun as i left the last house in the vale and finished word for word as it now stands before i came in view of rydal <\s>
<s> i wish i could say the same of the five or six hundred i have written most of them were frequently retouched in the course of composition and not a few laboriously <\s>
<s> i have only further to observe that the intended church which prompted these sonnets was erected on coleorton moor towards the centre of a very populous parish between three and four miles from ashby de la zouch on the road to loughborough and has proved i believe a great benefit to the neighbourhood <\s>

<s> during the month of december 1820 i accompanied a much beloved and honoured friend in a walk through different parts of his estate with a view to fix upon the site of a new church which he intended to erect <\s>
<s> it was one of the most beautiful mornings of a mild season our feelings were in harmony with the cherishing influences of the scene and such being our purpose we were naturally led to look back upon past events with wonder and gratitude and on the future with hope <\s>
<s> not long afterwards some of the sonnets which will be found towards the close of this series were produced as a private memorial of that morning's occupation <\s>
<s> the catholic question which was agitated in parliament about that time kept my thoughts in the same course and it struck me that certain points in the ecclesiastical history of our country might advantageously be presented to view in verse <\s>
<s> accordingly i took up the subject and what i now offer to the reader was the result <\s>

<s> rydal mount january 24 1822 <\s>
<s> for the convenience of passing from one point of the subject to another without shocks of abruptness this work has taken the shape of a series of sonnets but the reader it is to be hoped will find that the pictures are often so closely connected as to have jointly the effect of passages of a poem in a form of stanza to which there is no objection but one that bears upon the poet only its difficulty <\s>
<s> my purpose in writing this series was as much as possible to confine my view to the introduction progress and operation of the church in england both previous and subsequent to the reformation <\s>
<s> the sonnets were written long before ecclesiastical history and points of doctrine had excited the interest with which they have been recently enquired into and discussed <\s>
<s> the former particular is mentioned as an excuse for my having fallen into error in respect to an incident which had been selected as setting forth the height to which the power of the popedom over temporal sovereignty had attained and the arrogance with which it was displayed <\s>
<s> i allude to the last sonnet but one in the first series where pope alexander the third at venice is described as setting his foot on the neck of the emperor barbarossa <\s>

<s> omitting here to examine into his conduct in respect to the persecuting spirit with which he has been charged i am persuaded that most of his aims to restore ritual practices which had been abandoned were good and wise whatever errors he might commit in the manner he sometimes attempted to enforce them <\s>
<s> i further believe that had not he and others who shared his opinions and felt as he did stood up in opposition to the reformers of that period it is questionable whether the church would ever have recovered its lost ground and become the blessing it now is and will i trust become in a still greater degree both to those of its communion and those who unfortunately are separated from it 1 saw the figure of a lovely maid <\s>

<s> i wish i could say the same of the five or six hundred i have written most of them were frequently retouched in the course of composition and not a few laboriously <\s>
<s> i have only further to observe that the intended church which prompted these sonnets was erected on coleorton moor towards the centre of a very populous parish between three and four miles from ashby de la zouch on the road to loughborough and has proved i believe a great benefit to the neighbourhood <\s>

<s> during the month of december 1820 i accompanied a much beloved and honoured friend in a walk through different parts of his estate with a view to fix upon the site of a new church which he intended to erect <\s>
<s> it was one of the most beautiful mornings of a mild season our feelings were in harmony with the cherishing influences of the scene and such being our purpose we were naturally led to look back upon past events with wonder and gratitude and on the future with hope <\s>
<s> not long afterwards some of the sonnets which will be found towards the close of this series were produced as a private memorial of that morning's occupation <\s>
<s> the catholic question which was agitated in parliament about that time kept my thoughts in the same course and it struck me that certain points in the ecclesiastical history of our country might advantageously be presented to view in verse <\s>

<s> rydal mount january 24 1822 <\s>
<s> for the convenience of passing from one point of the subject to another without shocks of abruptness this work has taken the shape of a series of sonnets but the reader it is to be hoped will find that the pictures are often so closely connected as to have jointly the effect of passages of a poem in a form of stanza to which there is no objection but one that bears upon the poet only its difficulty <\s>
<s> my purpose in writing this series was as much as possible to confine my view to the introduction progress and operation of the church in england both previous and subsequent to the reformation <\s>

<s> the former particular is mentioned as an excuse for my having fallen into error in respect to an incident which had been selected as setting forth the height to which the power of the popedom over temporal sovereignty had attained and the arrogance with which it was displayed <\s>

<s> omitting here to examine into his conduct in respect to the persecuting spirit with which he has been charged i am persuaded that most of his aims to restore ritual practices which had been abandoned were good and wise whatever errors he might commit in the manner he sometimes attempted to enforce them <\s>
<s> i further believe that had not he and others who shared his opinions and felt as he did stood up in opposition to the reformers of that period it is questionable whether the church would ever have recovered its lost ground and become the blessing it now is and will i trust become in a still greater degree both to those of its communion and those who unfortunately are separated from it 1 saw the figure of a lovely maid <\s>

<s> i allude to the last sonnet but one in the first series where pope alexander the third at venice is described as setting his foot on the neck of the emperor barbarossa <\s>
<s> though this is related as a fact in history i am told it is a mere legend of no authority <\s>

<s> 111 before i conclude my notice of these sonnets let me observe that the opinion i pronounced in favour of laud long before the oxford tract movement and which had brought censure upon me from several quarters is not in the least changed <\s>
<s> omitting here to examine into his conduct in respect to the persecuting spirit with which he has been charged i am persuaded that most of his aims to restore ritual practices which had been abandoned were good and wise whatever errors he might commit in the manner he sometimes attempted to enforce them <\s>
<s> i further believe that had not he and others who shared his opinions and felt as he did stood up in opposition to the reformers of that period it is questionable whether the church would ever have recovered its lost ground and become the blessing it now is and will i trust become in a still greater degree both to those of its communion and those who unfortunately are separated from it 1 saw the figure of a lovely maid <\s>
<s> part iii when i came to this part of the series i had the dream described in this sonnet <\s>
<s> the figure was that of my daughter and the whole past exactly as here represented <\s>
<s> the sonnet was composed on the middle road leading from grasmere to ambleside it was begun as i left the last house in the vale and finished word for word as it now stands before i came in view of rydal <\s>
<s> i wish i could say the same of the five or six hundred i have written most of them were frequently retouched in the course of composition and not a few laboriously <\s>
<s> i have only further to observe that the intended church which prompted these sonnets was erected on coleorton moor towards the centre of a very populous parish between three and four miles from ashby de la zouch on the road to loughborough and has proved i believe a great benefit to the neighbourhood <\s>

<s> my dear c the passage which you have been so kind as to comment upon in one of the ecclesiastical sonnets was altered several years ago by my pen in a copy of my poems which i possess but the correction was not printed till a place was given it in the last edition printed last year in one volume <\s>

<s> though for my own part as i mentioned some time since in a letter i had occasion to write to the bishop of i do not like the term reformed if taken in its literal sense as a transformation it is very objectionable <\s>
<s> further on the sonnets on aspects of christianity in america wordsworth wrote to his valued friend professor reed of philadelphia as follows a few days ago after a very long interval i returned to poetical composition and my first employment was to write a couple of sonnets upon subjects recommended by you to take place in the ecclesiastical series <\s>
<s> they are upon the marriage ceremony and the funeral service <\s>
<s> i have also at the same time added two others one upon visiting the sick and the other upon the thanksgiving of women after childbirth both subjects taken from the services of our liturgy <\s>
<s> to the second part of the same series i have also added two in order to do more justice to the papal church for the services which she did actually render to christianity and humanity in the middle ages <\s>
<s> by the by the sonnet beginning men of the western world c <\s>
<s> was slightly altered after i sent it to you not in the hope of substituting a better verse but merely to avoid the repetition of the same word book which occurs as a rhyme in the pilgrim fathers <\s>

<s> the last six lines of this sonnet are chiefly from the prose of daniel and here i will state though to the readers whom this poem will chiefly interest it is unnecessary that my obligations to other prose writers are frequent obligations which even if i had not a pleasure in courting it would have been presumptuous to shun in treating an historical subject <\s>

<s> 1 see the original of this speech in bede the conversion of edwin as related by him is highly interesting and the breaking up of this council accompanied with an event so striking and characteristic that i am tempted to give it at length in a translation <\s>

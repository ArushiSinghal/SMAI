<s> nevertheless i would relish to the utmost the demonstrations of every species of power at work to effect such changes <\s>
<s> from these general views let us descend a moment to detail <\s>
<s> a stranger to mountain imagery naturally on his first arrival looks out for sublimity in every object that admits of it and is almost always disappointed <\s>
<s> for this disappointment there exists i believe no general preventive nor is it desirable that there should <\s>
<s> but with regard to one class of objects there is a point in which injurious expectations may be easily corrected <\s>
<s> it is generally supposed that waterfalls are scarcely worth being looked at except after much rain and that the more swoln the stream the more fortunate the spectator but this however is true only of large cataracts with sublime accompaniments and not even of these without some drawbacks <\s>

<s> but considering these things as objects of sight only it may be observed that the principal charm of the smaller waterfalls or cascades consists in certain proportions of form and affinities of colour among the component parts of the scene and in the contrast maintained between the falling water and that which is apparently at rest or rather settling gradually into quiet in the pool below <\s>
<s> the beauty of such a scene where there is naturally so much agitation is also heightened in a peculiar manner by the glimmering and towards the verge of the pool by the steady reflection of the surrounding images <\s>

<s> a happy proportion of component parts is indeed noticeable among the landscapes of the north of england and in this characteristic essential to a perfect picture they surpass the scenes of scotland and in a still greater degree those of switzerland <\s>
<s> as a resident among the lakes i frequently hear the scenery of this country compared with that of the alps and therefore a few words shall be added to what has been incidentally said upon that subject <\s>
<s> if we could recall to this region of lakes the native pine forests with which many hundred years ago a large portion of the heights was covered then during spring and autumn it might frequently with much propriety be compared to switzerland the elements of the landscape would be the same one country representing the other in miniature <\s>
<s> towns villages churches rural seats bridges and roads green meadows and arable grounds with their various produce and deciduous woods of diversified foliage which occupy the vales and lower regions of the mountains would as in switzerland be divided by dark forests from ridges and round topped heights covered with snow and from pikes and sharp declivities imperfectly arrayed in the same glittering mantle and the resemblance would be still more perfect on those days when vapours resting upon and floating around the summits leave the elevation of the mountains less dependent upon the eye than on the imagination <\s>
<s> but the pine forests have wholly disappeared and only during late spring and early autumn is realised here that assemblage of the imagery of different seasons which is exhibited through the whole summer among the alps winter in the distance and warmth leafy woods verdure and fertility at hand and widely diffused <\s>
<s> striking then from among the permanent materials of the landscape that stage of vegetation which is occupied by pine forests and above that the perennial snows we have mountains the highest of which little exceed 3000 feet while some of the alps do not fall short of 14,000 or 15,000 and 8000 or 10,000 is not an uncommon elevation <\s>
<s> our tracts of wood and water are almost diminutive in comparison therefore as far as sublimity is dependent upon absolute bulk and height and atmospherical influences in connection with these it is obvious that there can be no rivalship <\s>
<s> but a short residence among the british mountains will furnish abundant proof that after a certain point of elevation viz <\s>
<s> that which allows of compact and fleecy clouds settling upon or sweeping over the summits the sense of sublimity depends more upon form and relation of objects to each other than upon their actual magnitude and that an elevation of 3000 feet is sufficient to call forth in a most impressive degree the creative and magnifying and softening powers of the atmosphere <\s>
<s> hence on the score even of sublimity the superiority of the alps is by no means so great as might hastily be inferred and as to the beauty of the lower regions of the swiss mountains it is noticeable that as they are all regularly mown their surface has nothing of that mellow tone and variety of hues by which mountain turf that is never touched by the scythe is distinguished <\s>
<s> on the smooth and steep slopes of the swiss hills these plots of verdure do indeed agreeably unite their colour with that of the deciduous trees or make a lively contrast with the dark green pine groves that define them and among which they run in endless variety of shapes but this is most pleasing at first sight the permanent gratification of the eye requires finer gradations of tone and a more delicate blending of hues into each other <\s>
<s> besides it is only in spring and late autumn that cattle animate by their presence the swiss lawns and though the pastures of the higher regions where they feed during the summer are left in their natural state of flowery herbage those pastures are so remote that their texture and colour are of no consequence in the composition of any picture in which a lake of the vales is a feature <\s>
<s> yet in those lofty regions how vegetation is invigorated by the genial climate of that country <\s>
<s> among the luxuriant flowers there met with groves or forests if i may so call them of monks hood are frequently seen the plant of deep rich blue and as tall as in our gardens and this at an elevation where in cumberland icelandic moss would only be found or the stony summits be utterly bare <\s>
<s> we have then for the colouring of switzerland principally a vivid green herbage black woods and dazzling snows presented in masses with a grandeur to which no one can be insensible but not often graduated by nature into soothing harmony and so ill suited to the pencil that though abundance of good subjects may be there found they are not such as can be deemed characteristic of the country nor is this unfitness confined to colour the forms of the mountains though many of them in some points of view the noblest that can be conceived are apt to run into spikes and needles and present a jagged outline which has a mean effect transferred to canvass <\s>
<s> this must have been felt by the ancient masters for if i am not mistaken they have not left a single landscape the materials of which are taken from the peculiar features of the alps yet titian passed his life almost in their neighbourhood the poussins and claude must have been well acquainted with their aspects and several admirable painters as tibaldi and luino were born among the italian alps <\s>
<s> a few experiments have lately been made by englishmen but they only prove that courage skill and judgment may surmount any obstacles and it may be safely affirmed that they who have done best in this bold adventure will be the least likely to repeat the attempt <\s>
<s> but though our scenes are better suited to painting than those of the alps i should be sorry to contemplate either country in reference to that art further than as its fitness or unfitness for the pencil renders it more or less pleasing to the eye of the spectator who has learned to observe and feel chiefly from nature herself <\s>
<s> deeming the points in which alpine imagery is superior to british too obvious to be insisted upon i will observe that the deciduous woods though in many places unapproachable by the axe and triumphing in the pomp and prodigality of nature have in general 63 neither the variety nor beauty which would exist in those of the mountains of britain if left to themselves <\s>
<s> magnificent walnut trees grow upon the plains of switzerland and fine trees of that species are found scattered over the hill sides birches also grow here and there in luxuriant beauty but neither these nor oaks are ever a prevailing tree nor can even be said to be common and the oaks as far as i had an opportunity of observing are greatly inferior to those of britain <\s>
<s> among the interior vallies the proportion of beeches and pines is so great that other trees are scarcely noticeable and surely such woods are at all seasons much less agreeable than that rich and harmonious distribution of oak ash elm birch and alder that formerly clothed the sides of snowdon and helvellyn and of which no mean remains still survive at the head of ulswater <\s>
<s> on the italian side of the alps chesnut and walnut trees grow at a considerable height on the mountains but even there the foliage is not equal in beauty to the natural product of this climate <\s>
<s> in fact the sunshine of the south of europe so envied when heard of at a distance is in many respects injurious to rural beauty particularly as it incites to the cultivation of spots of ground which in colder climates would be left in the hands of nature favouring at the same time the culture of plants that are more valuable on account of the fruit they produce to gratify the palate than for affording pleasure to the eye as materials of landscape <\s>
<s> take for instance the promontory of bellagio so fortunate in its command of the three branches of the lake of como yet the ridge of the promontory itself being for the most part covered with vines interspersed with olive trees accords but ill with the vastness of the green unappropriated mountains and derogates not a little from the sublimity of those finely contrasted pictures to which it is a foreground <\s>
<s> the vine when cultivated upon a large scale notwithstanding all that may be said of it in poetry 64 makes but a dull formal appearance in landscape and the olive tree though one is loth to say so is not more grateful to the eye than our common willow which it much resembles but the hoariness of hue common to both has in the aquatic plant an appropriate delicacy harmonising with the situation in which it most delights <\s>
<s> the same may no doubt be said of the olive among the dry rocks of attica but i am speaking of it as found in gardens and vineyards in the north of italy <\s>
<s> at bellagio what englishman can resist the temptation of substituting in his fancy for these formal treasures of cultivation the natural variety of one of our parks its pastured lawns coverts of hawthorn of wild rose and honeysuckle and the majesty of forest trees such wild graces as the banks of derwent water shewed in the time of the ratcliffes and growbarrow park lowther and rydal do at this day <\s>
<s> 63 the greatest variety of trees is found in the valais <\s>
<s> as my object is to reconcile a briton to the scenery of his own country though not at the expense of truth i am not afraid of asserting that in many points of view our lakes also are much more interesting than those of the alps first as is implied above from being more happily proportioned to the other features of the landscape and next both as being infinitely more pellucid and less subject to agitation from the winds 65 64 lucretius has charmingly described a scene of this kind <\s>
<s> inque dies magis in montem succedere sylvas cogebant infráquo locum coucedere cultis prata lacus rivos segetes vinetaque laeta collibus et campis ut haberent atque olearum caerula distinguens inter plaga currere posset per tumulos et convalleis camposque profusa ut nunc esse vides vario distincta lepore onmia quae pomis intersita dulcibus ornant arbustisque teneut felicibus obsita circúm <\s>
<s> 65 it is remarkable that como as is probably the case with other italian lakes is more troubled by storms in summer than in winter <\s>
<s> hence the propriety of the following verses lari <\s>
<s> margine ubique confragoso nulli coelicolum negas sacellum picto pariete saxeoque tecto hinc miracula multa navitarum audis nee placido refellis ore sed nova usque pavas noto vel euro aestivas quatieutibus cavernas vel surgentis ab adduae cubili caeco grandinis imbre provoluto <\s>
<s> como which may perhaps be styled the king of lakes as lugano is certainly the queen is disturbed by a periodical wind blowing from the head in the morning and towards it in the afternoon <\s>
<s> the magnificent lake of the four cantons especially its noblest division called the lake of uri is not only much agitated by winds but in the night time is disturbed from the bottom as i was told and indeed as i witnessed without any apparent commotion in the air and when at rest the water is not pure to the eye but of a heavy green hue as is that of all the other lakes apparently according to the degree in which they are fed by melted snows <\s>
<s> if the lake of geneva furnish an exception this is probably owing to its vast extent which allows the water to deposit its impurities <\s>
<s> the water of the english lakes on the contrary being of a crystalline clearness the reflections of the surrounding hills are frequently so lively that it is scarcely possible to distinguish the point where the real object terminates and its unsubstantial duplicate begins <\s>
<s> the lower part of the lake of geneva from its narrowness must be much less subject to agitation than the higher divisions and as the water is clearer than that of the other swiss lakes it will frequently exhibit this appearance though it is scarcely possible in an equal degree <\s>
<s> during two comprehensive tours among the alps i did not observe except on one of the smaller lakes between lugano and ponte tresa a single instance of those beautiful repetitions of surrounding objects on the bosom of the water which are so frequently seen here not to speak of the fine dazzling trembling net work breezy motions and streaks and circles of intermingled smooth and rippled water which make the surface of our lakes a field of endless variety <\s>
<s> but among the alps where every thing tends to the grand and the sublime in surfaces as well as in forms if the lakes do not court the placid reflections of land objects those of first rate magnitude make compensation in some degree by exhibiting those ever changing fields of green blue and purple shadows or lights one scarcely knows which to name them that call to mind a sea prospect contemplated from a lofty cliff <\s>
<s> the subject of torrents and waterfalls has already been touched upon but it may be added that in switzerland the perpetual accompaniment of snow upon the higher regions takes much from the effect of foaming white streams while from their frequency they obstruct each other's influence upon the mind of the spectator and in all cases the effect of an individual cataract excepting the great fall of the rhine at schaffhausen is diminished by the general fury of the stream of which it is a part <\s>
<s> recurring to the reflections from still water i will describe a singular phenomenon of this kind of which i was an eye witness <\s>
<s> walking by the side of ulswater upon a calm september morning i saw deep within the bosom of the lake a magnificent castle with towers and battlements nothing could be more distinct than the whole edifice <\s>
<s> after gazing with delight upon it for some time as upon a work of enchantment i could not but regret that my previous knowledge of the place enabled me to account for the appearance <\s>
<s> it was in fact the reflection of a pleasure house called lyulph's tower the towers and battlements magnified and so much changed in shape as not to be immediately recognised <\s>
<s> in the meanwhile the pleasure house itself was altogether hidden from my view by a body of vapour stretching over it and along the hill side on which it stands but not so as to have intercepted its communication with the lake and hence this novel and most impressive object which if i had been a stranger to the spot would from its being inexplicable have long detained the mind in a state of pleasing astonishment <\s>
<s> appearances of this kind acting upon the credulity of early ages may have given birth to and favoured the belief in stories of sub aqueous palaces gardens and pleasure grounds the brilliant ornaments of romance <\s>
<s> with this inverted scene i will couple a much more extraordinary phenomenon which will show how other elegant fancies may have had their origin less in invention than in the actual processes of nature <\s>
<s> about eleven o'clock on the forenoon of a winter's day coming suddenly in company of a friend into view of the lake of grasmere we were alarmed by the sight of a newly created island the transitory thought of the moment was that it had been produced by an earthquake or some other convulsion of nature <\s>
<s> recovering from the alarm which was greater than the reader can possibly sympathise with but which was shared to its full extent by my companion we proceeded to examine the object before us <\s>
<s> the elevation of this new island exceeded considerably that of the old one its neighbour it was likewise larger in circumference comprehending a space of about five acres its surface rocky speckled with snow and sprinkled over with birch trees it was divided towards the south from the other island by a narrow frith and in like manner from the northern shore of the lake on the east and west it was separated from the shore by a much larger space of smooth water <\s>
<s> marvellous was the illusion <\s>
<s> comparing the new with the old island the surface of which is soft green and unvaried i do not scruple to say that as an object of sight it was much the more distinct <\s>
<s> how little faith we exclaimed is due to one sense unless its evidence be confirmed by some of its fellows <\s>
<s> what stranger could possibly be persuaded that this which we know to be an unsubstantial mockery is really so and that there exists only a single island on this beautiful lake <\s>
<s> at length the appearance underwent a gradual transmutation it lost its prominence and passed into a glimmering and dim inversion and then totally disappeared leaving behind it a clear open area of ice of the same dimensions <\s>
<s> we now perceived that this bed of ice which was thinly suffused with water had produced the illusion by reflecting and refracting as persons skilled in optics would no doubt easily explain a rocky and woody section of the opposite mountain named silver how <\s>
<s> having dwelt so much upon the beauty of pure and still water and pointed out the advantage which the lakes of the north of england have in this particular over those of the alps it would be injustice not to advert to the sublimity that must often be given to alpine scenes by the agitations to which those vast bodies of diffused water are there subject <\s>
<s> i have witnessed many tremendous thunder storms among the alps and the most glorious effects of light and shadow but i never happened to be present when any lake was agitated by those hurricanes which i imagine must often torment them <\s>
<s> if the commotions be at all proportionable to the expanse and depth of the waters and the height of the surrounding mountains then if i may judge from what is frequently seen here the exhibition must be awful and astonishing on this day march 30 1822 the winds have been acting upon the small lake of rydal as if they had received command to carry its waters from their bed into the sky the white billows in different quarters disappeared under clouds or rather drifts of spray that were whirled along and up into the air by scouring winds charging each other in squadrons in every direction upon the lake <\s>
<s> the spray having been hurried aloft till it lost its consistency and whiteness was driven along the mountain tops like flying showers that vanish in the distance <\s>
<s> frequently an eddying wind scooped the waters out of the basin and forced them upwards in the very shape of an icelandic geyser or boiling fountain to the height of several hundred feet <\s>
<s> this small mere of rydal from its position is subject in a peculiar degree to these commotions <\s>
<s> the present season however is unusually stormy great numbers of fish two of them not less than 12 pounds weight were a few days ago cast on the shores of derwent water by the force of the waves <\s>

<s> with this inverted scene i will couple a much more extraordinary phenomenon which will show how other elegant fancies may have had their origin less in invention than in the actual processes of nature <\s>
<s> about eleven o'clock on the forenoon of a winter's day coming suddenly in company of a friend into view of the lake of grasmere we were alarmed by the sight of a newly created island the transitory thought of the moment was that it had been produced by an earthquake or some other convulsion of nature <\s>
<s> recovering from the alarm which was greater than the reader can possibly sympathise with but which was shared to its full extent by my companion we proceeded to examine the object before us <\s>
<s> the elevation of this new island exceeded considerably that of the old one its neighbour it was likewise larger in circumference comprehending a space of about five acres its surface rocky speckled with snow and sprinkled over with birch trees it was divided towards the south from the other island by a narrow frith and in like manner from the northern shore of the lake on the east and west it was separated from the shore by a much larger space of smooth water <\s>
<s> marvellous was the illusion <\s>
<s> comparing the new with the old island the surface of which is soft green and unvaried i do not scruple to say that as an object of sight it was much the more distinct <\s>
<s> how little faith we exclaimed is due to one sense unless its evidence be confirmed by some of its fellows <\s>
<s> what stranger could possibly be persuaded that this which we know to be an unsubstantial mockery is really so and that there exists only a single island on this beautiful lake <\s>
<s> at length the appearance underwent a gradual transmutation it lost its prominence and passed into a glimmering and dim inversion and then totally disappeared leaving behind it a clear open area of ice of the same dimensions <\s>
<s> we now perceived that this bed of ice which was thinly suffused with water had produced the illusion by reflecting and refracting as persons skilled in optics would no doubt easily explain a rocky and woody section of the opposite mountain named silver how <\s>
<s> having dwelt so much upon the beauty of pure and still water and pointed out the advantage which the lakes of the north of england have in this particular over those of the alps it would be injustice not to advert to the sublimity that must often be given to alpine scenes by the agitations to which those vast bodies of diffused water are there subject <\s>
<s> i have witnessed many tremendous thunder storms among the alps and the most glorious effects of light and shadow but i never happened to be present when any lake was agitated by those hurricanes which i imagine must often torment them <\s>
<s> if the commotions be at all proportionable to the expanse and depth of the waters and the height of the surrounding mountains then if i may judge from what is frequently seen here the exhibition must be awful and astonishing on this day march 30 1822 the winds have been acting upon the small lake of rydal as if they had received command to carry its waters from their bed into the sky the white billows in different quarters disappeared under clouds or rather drifts of spray that were whirled along and up into the air by scouring winds charging each other in squadrons in every direction upon the lake <\s>
<s> the spray having been hurried aloft till it lost its consistency and whiteness was driven along the mountain tops like flying showers that vanish in the distance <\s>
<s> frequently an eddying wind scooped the waters out of the basin and forced them upwards in the very shape of an icelandic geyser or boiling fountain to the height of several hundred feet <\s>
<s> this small mere of rydal from its position is subject in a peculiar degree to these commotions <\s>
<s> the present season however is unusually stormy great numbers of fish two of them not less than 12 pounds weight were a few days ago cast on the shores of derwent water by the force of the waves <\s>
<s> lest in the foregoing comparative estimate i should be suspected of partiality to my native mountains i will support my general opinion by the authority of mr <\s>
<s> west whose guide to the lakes has been eminently serviceable to the tourist for nearly 50 years <\s>
<s> the author a roman catholic clergyman had passed much time abroad and was well acquainted with the scenery of the continent <\s>
<s> he thus expresses himself they who intend to make the continental tour should begin here as it will give in miniature an idea of what they are to meet with there in traversing the alps and appenines to which our northern mountains are not inferior in beauty of line or variety of summit number of lakes and transparency of water not in colouring of rock or softness of turf but in height and extent only <\s>
<s> the mountains here are all accessible to the summit and furnish prospects no less surprising and with more variety than the alps themselves <\s>
<s> for no traveller provided he be in good health and with any command of time would have a just privilege to visit such scenes if he could grudge the price of a little confinement among them or interruption in his journey for the sight or sound of a storm coming on or clearing away <\s>
<s> insensible must he be who would not congratulate himself upon the bold bursts of sunshine the descending vapours wandering lights and shadows and the invigorated torrents and waterfalls with which broken weather in a mountainous region is accompanied <\s>
<s> at such a time there is no cause to complain either of the monotony of midsummer colouring or the glaring atmosphere of long cloudless and hot days <\s>
<s> thus far concerning the respective advantages and disadvantages of the different seasons for visiting this country <\s>
<s> as to the order in which objects are best seen a lake being composed of water flowing from higher grounds and expanding itself till its receptacle is filled to the brim it follows that it will appear to most advantage when approached from its outlet especially if the lake be in a mountainous country for by this way of approach the traveller faces the grander features of the scene and is gradually conducted into its most sublime recesses <\s>
<s> now every one knows that from amenity and beauty the transition to sublimity is easy and favourable but the reverse is not so for after the faculties have been elevated they are indisposed to humbler excitement 62 62 the only instances to which the foregoing observations do not apply are derwent water and lowes water <\s>
<s> derwent is distinguished from all the other lakes by being surrounded with sublimity the fantastic mountains of borrowdale to the south the solitary majesty of skiddaw to the north the bold steeps of wallow crag and lodore to the east and to the west the clustering mountains of newlands <\s>
<s> lowes water is tame at the head but towards its outlet has a magnificent assemblage of mountains <\s>
<s> yet as far as respects the formation of such receptacles the general observation holds good neither derwent nor lowes water derive any supplies from the streams of those mountains that dignify the landscape towards the outlets <\s>
<s> it is not likely that a mountain will be ascended without disappointment if a wide range of prospect be the object unless either the summit be reached before sun rise or the visitant remain there until the time of sun set and afterwards <\s>
<s> the precipitous sides of the mountain and the neighbouring summits may be seen with effect under any atmosphere which allows them to be seen at all but he is the most fortunate adventurer who chances to be involved in vapours which open and let in an extent of country partially or dispersing suddenly reveal the whole region from centre to circumference <\s>
<s> a stranger to a mountainous country may not be aware that his walk in the early morning ought to be taken on the eastern side of the vale otherwise he will lose the morning light first touching the tops and thence creeping down the sides of the opposite hills as the sun ascends or he may go to some central eminence commanding both the shadows from the eastern and the lights upon the western mountains <\s>
<s> but if the horizon line in the east be low the western side may be taken for the sake of the reflections upon the water of light from the rising sun <\s>
<s> in the evening for like reasons the contrary course should be taken <\s>
<s> after all it is upon the mind which a traveller brings along with him that his acquisitions whether of pleasure or profit must principally depend may i be allowed a few words on this subject <\s>
<s> nothing is more injurious to genuine feeling than the practice of hastily and ungraciously depreciating the face of one country by comparing it with that of another <\s>
<s> true it is qui bene distinguit bene docet yet fastidiousness is a wretched travelling companion and the best guide to which in matters of taste we can entrust ourselves is a disposition to be pleased <\s>
<s> for example if a traveller be among the alps let him surrender up his mind to the fury of the gigantic torrents and take delight in the contemplation of their almost irresistible violence without complaining of the monotony of their foaming course or being disgusted with the muddiness of the water apparent even where it is violently agitated <\s>
<s> in cumberland and westmoreland let not the comparative weakness of the streams prevent him from sympathising with such impetuosity as they possess and making the most of the present objects let him as he justly may do observe with admiration the unrivalled brilliancy of the water and that variety of motion mood and character that arises out of the want of those resources by which the power of the streams in the alps is supported again with respect to the mountains though these are comparatively of diminutive size though there is little of perpetual snow and no voice of summer avalanches is heard among them and though traces left by the ravage of the elements are here comparatively rare and unimpressive yet out of this very deficiency proceeds a sense of stability and permanence that is to many minds more grateful while the hoarse rushes to the sweeping breeze sigh forth their ancient melodies <\s>
<s> among the alps are few places that do not preclude this feeling of tranquil sublimity <\s>
<s> havoc and ruin and desolation and encroachment are everywhere more or less obtruded and it is difficult notwithstanding the naked loftiness of the pikes and the snow capped summits of the mounts to escape from the depressing sensation that the whole are in a rapid process of dissolution and were it not that the destructive agency must abate as the heights diminish would in time to come be levelled with the plains <\s>
<s> nevertheless i would relish to the utmost the demonstrations of every species of power at work to effect such changes <\s>
<s> from these general views let us descend a moment to detail <\s>
<s> a stranger to mountain imagery naturally on his first arrival looks out for sublimity in every object that admits of it and is almost always disappointed <\s>
<s> for this disappointment there exists i believe no general preventive nor is it desirable that there should <\s>
<s> but with regard to one class of objects there is a point in which injurious expectations may be easily corrected <\s>
<s> it is generally supposed that waterfalls are scarcely worth being looked at except after much rain and that the more swoln the stream the more fortunate the spectator but this however is true only of large cataracts with sublime accompaniments and not even of these without some drawbacks <\s>
<s> in other instances what becomes at such a time of that sense of refreshing coolness which can only be felt in dry and sunny weather when the rocks herbs and flowers glisten with moisture diffused by the breath of the precipitous water <\s>
<s> but considering these things as objects of sight only it may be observed that the principal charm of the smaller waterfalls or cascades consists in certain proportions of form and affinities of colour among the component parts of the scene and in the contrast maintained between the falling water and that which is apparently at rest or rather settling gradually into quiet in the pool below <\s>
<s> the beauty of such a scene where there is naturally so much agitation is also heightened in a peculiar manner by the glimmering and towards the verge of the pool by the steady reflection of the surrounding images <\s>
<s> now all those delicate distinctions are destroyed by heavy floods and the whole stream rushes along in foam and tumultuous confusion <\s>
<s> a happy proportion of component parts is indeed noticeable among the landscapes of the north of england and in this characteristic essential to a perfect picture they surpass the scenes of scotland and in a still greater degree those of switzerland <\s>
<s> as a resident among the lakes i frequently hear the scenery of this country compared with that of the alps and therefore a few words shall be added to what has been incidentally said upon that subject <\s>
<s> if we could recall to this region of lakes the native pine forests with which many hundred years ago a large portion of the heights was covered then during spring and autumn it might frequently with much propriety be compared to switzerland the elements of the landscape would be the same one country representing the other in miniature <\s>
<s> towns villages churches rural seats bridges and roads green meadows and arable grounds with their various produce and deciduous woods of diversified foliage which occupy the vales and lower regions of the mountains would as in switzerland be divided by dark forests from ridges and round topped heights covered with snow and from pikes and sharp declivities imperfectly arrayed in the same glittering mantle and the resemblance would be still more perfect on those days when vapours resting upon and floating around the summits leave the elevation of the mountains less dependent upon the eye than on the imagination <\s>
<s> but the pine forests have wholly disappeared and only during late spring and early autumn is realised here that assemblage of the imagery of different seasons which is exhibited through the whole summer among the alps winter in the distance and warmth leafy woods verdure and fertility at hand and widely diffused <\s>
<s> striking then from among the permanent materials of the landscape that stage of vegetation which is occupied by pine forests and above that the perennial snows we have mountains the highest of which little exceed 3000 feet while some of the alps do not fall short of 14,000 or 15,000 and 8000 or 10,000 is not an uncommon elevation <\s>
<s> our tracts of wood and water are almost diminutive in comparison therefore as far as sublimity is dependent upon absolute bulk and height and atmospherical influences in connection with these it is obvious that there can be no rivalship <\s>
<s> but a short residence among the british mountains will furnish abundant proof that after a certain point of elevation viz <\s>
<s> that which allows of compact and fleecy clouds settling upon or sweeping over the summits the sense of sublimity depends more upon form and relation of objects to each other than upon their actual magnitude and that an elevation of 3000 feet is sufficient to call forth in a most impressive degree the creative and magnifying and softening powers of the atmosphere <\s>
<s> hence on the score even of sublimity the superiority of the alps is by no means so great as might hastily be inferred and as to the beauty of the lower regions of the swiss mountains it is noticeable that as they are all regularly mown their surface has nothing of that mellow tone and variety of hues by which mountain turf that is never touched by the scythe is distinguished <\s>
<s> on the smooth and steep slopes of the swiss hills these plots of verdure do indeed agreeably unite their colour with that of the deciduous trees or make a lively contrast with the dark green pine groves that define them and among which they run in endless variety of shapes but this is most pleasing at first sight the permanent gratification of the eye requires finer gradations of tone and a more delicate blending of hues into each other <\s>
<s> besides it is only in spring and late autumn that cattle animate by their presence the swiss lawns and though the pastures of the higher regions where they feed during the summer are left in their natural state of flowery herbage those pastures are so remote that their texture and colour are of no consequence in the composition of any picture in which a lake of the vales is a feature <\s>
<s> yet in those lofty regions how vegetation is invigorated by the genial climate of that country <\s>
<s> among the luxuriant flowers there met with groves or forests if i may so call them of monks hood are frequently seen the plant of deep rich blue and as tall as in our gardens and this at an elevation where in cumberland icelandic moss would only be found or the stony summits be utterly bare <\s>

<s> this must have been felt by the ancient masters for if i am not mistaken they have not left a single landscape the materials of which are taken from the peculiar features of the alps yet titian passed his life almost in their neighbourhood the poussins and claude must have been well acquainted with their aspects and several admirable painters as tibaldi and luino were born among the italian alps <\s>

<s> but though our scenes are better suited to painting than those of the alps i should be sorry to contemplate either country in reference to that art further than as its fitness or unfitness for the pencil renders it more or less pleasing to the eye of the spectator who has learned to observe and feel chiefly from nature herself <\s>

<s> true it is qui bene distinguit bene docet yet fastidiousness is a wretched travelling companion and the best guide to which in matters of taste we can entrust ourselves is a disposition to be pleased <\s>

<s> in cumberland and westmoreland let not the comparative weakness of the streams prevent him from sympathising with such impetuosity as they possess and making the most of the present objects let him as he justly may do observe with admiration the unrivalled brilliancy of the water and that variety of motion mood and character that arises out of the want of those resources by which the power of the streams in the alps is supported again with respect to the mountains though these are comparatively of diminutive size though there is little of perpetual snow and no voice of summer avalanches is heard among them and though traces left by the ravage of the elements are here comparatively rare and unimpressive yet out of this very deficiency proceeds a sense of stability and permanence that is to many minds more grateful while the hoarse rushes to the sweeping breeze sigh forth their ancient melodies <\s>
<s> among the alps are few places that do not preclude this feeling of tranquil sublimity <\s>
<s> havoc and ruin and desolation and encroachment are everywhere more or less obtruded and it is difficult notwithstanding the naked loftiness of the pikes and the snow capped summits of the mounts to escape from the depressing sensation that the whole are in a rapid process of dissolution and were it not that the destructive agency must abate as the heights diminish would in time to come be levelled with the plains <\s>
<s> nevertheless i would relish to the utmost the demonstrations of every species of power at work to effect such changes <\s>
<s> from these general views let us descend a moment to detail <\s>
<s> a stranger to mountain imagery naturally on his first arrival looks out for sublimity in every object that admits of it and is almost always disappointed <\s>
<s> for this disappointment there exists i believe no general preventive nor is it desirable that there should <\s>
<s> but with regard to one class of objects there is a point in which injurious expectations may be easily corrected <\s>
<s> it is generally supposed that waterfalls are scarcely worth being looked at except after much rain and that the more swoln the stream the more fortunate the spectator but this however is true only of large cataracts with sublime accompaniments and not even of these without some drawbacks <\s>
<s> in other instances what becomes at such a time of that sense of refreshing coolness which can only be felt in dry and sunny weather when the rocks herbs and flowers glisten with moisture diffused by the breath of the precipitous water <\s>
<s> but considering these things as objects of sight only it may be observed that the principal charm of the smaller waterfalls or cascades consists in certain proportions of form and affinities of colour among the component parts of the scene and in the contrast maintained between the falling water and that which is apparently at rest or rather settling gradually into quiet in the pool below <\s>
<s> the beauty of such a scene where there is naturally so much agitation is also heightened in a peculiar manner by the glimmering and towards the verge of the pool by the steady reflection of the surrounding images <\s>
<s> now all those delicate distinctions are destroyed by heavy floods and the whole stream rushes along in foam and tumultuous confusion <\s>
<s> a happy proportion of component parts is indeed noticeable among the landscapes of the north of england and in this characteristic essential to a perfect picture they surpass the scenes of scotland and in a still greater degree those of switzerland <\s>
<s> as a resident among the lakes i frequently hear the scenery of this country compared with that of the alps and therefore a few words shall be added to what has been incidentally said upon that subject <\s>
<s> if we could recall to this region of lakes the native pine forests with which many hundred years ago a large portion of the heights was covered then during spring and autumn it might frequently with much propriety be compared to switzerland the elements of the landscape would be the same one country representing the other in miniature <\s>
<s> towns villages churches rural seats bridges and roads green meadows and arable grounds with their various produce and deciduous woods of diversified foliage which occupy the vales and lower regions of the mountains would as in switzerland be divided by dark forests from ridges and round topped heights covered with snow and from pikes and sharp declivities imperfectly arrayed in the same glittering mantle and the resemblance would be still more perfect on those days when vapours resting upon and floating around the summits leave the elevation of the mountains less dependent upon the eye than on the imagination <\s>
<s> but the pine forests have wholly disappeared and only during late spring and early autumn is realised here that assemblage of the imagery of different seasons which is exhibited through the whole summer among the alps winter in the distance and warmth leafy woods verdure and fertility at hand and widely diffused <\s>
<s> striking then from among the permanent materials of the landscape that stage of vegetation which is occupied by pine forests and above that the perennial snows we have mountains the highest of which little exceed 3000 feet while some of the alps do not fall short of 14,000 or 15,000 and 8000 or 10,000 is not an uncommon elevation <\s>
<s> our tracts of wood and water are almost diminutive in comparison therefore as far as sublimity is dependent upon absolute bulk and height and atmospherical influences in connection with these it is obvious that there can be no rivalship <\s>
<s> but a short residence among the british mountains will furnish abundant proof that after a certain point of elevation viz <\s>
<s> that which allows of compact and fleecy clouds settling upon or sweeping over the summits the sense of sublimity depends more upon form and relation of objects to each other than upon their actual magnitude and that an elevation of 3000 feet is sufficient to call forth in a most impressive degree the creative and magnifying and softening powers of the atmosphere <\s>
<s> hence on the score even of sublimity the superiority of the alps is by no means so great as might hastily be inferred and as to the beauty of the lower regions of the swiss mountains it is noticeable that as they are all regularly mown their surface has nothing of that mellow tone and variety of hues by which mountain turf that is never touched by the scythe is distinguished <\s>
<s> on the smooth and steep slopes of the swiss hills these plots of verdure do indeed agreeably unite their colour with that of the deciduous trees or make a lively contrast with the dark green pine groves that define them and among which they run in endless variety of shapes but this is most pleasing at first sight the permanent gratification of the eye requires finer gradations of tone and a more delicate blending of hues into each other <\s>
<s> besides it is only in spring and late autumn that cattle animate by their presence the swiss lawns and though the pastures of the higher regions where they feed during the summer are left in their natural state of flowery herbage those pastures are so remote that their texture and colour are of no consequence in the composition of any picture in which a lake of the vales is a feature <\s>
<s> yet in those lofty regions how vegetation is invigorated by the genial climate of that country <\s>
<s> among the luxuriant flowers there met with groves or forests if i may so call them of monks hood are frequently seen the plant of deep rich blue and as tall as in our gardens and this at an elevation where in cumberland icelandic moss would only be found or the stony summits be utterly bare <\s>
<s> we have then for the colouring of switzerland principally a vivid green herbage black woods and dazzling snows presented in masses with a grandeur to which no one can be insensible but not often graduated by nature into soothing harmony and so ill suited to the pencil that though abundance of good subjects may be there found they are not such as can be deemed characteristic of the country nor is this unfitness confined to colour the forms of the mountains though many of them in some points of view the noblest that can be conceived are apt to run into spikes and needles and present a jagged outline which has a mean effect transferred to canvass <\s>
<s> this must have been felt by the ancient masters for if i am not mistaken they have not left a single landscape the materials of which are taken from the peculiar features of the alps yet titian passed his life almost in their neighbourhood the poussins and claude must have been well acquainted with their aspects and several admirable painters as tibaldi and luino were born among the italian alps <\s>
<s> a few experiments have lately been made by englishmen but they only prove that courage skill and judgment may surmount any obstacles and it may be safely affirmed that they who have done best in this bold adventure will be the least likely to repeat the attempt <\s>
<s> but though our scenes are better suited to painting than those of the alps i should be sorry to contemplate either country in reference to that art further than as its fitness or unfitness for the pencil renders it more or less pleasing to the eye of the spectator who has learned to observe and feel chiefly from nature herself <\s>
<s> deeming the points in which alpine imagery is superior to british too obvious to be insisted upon i will observe that the deciduous woods though in many places unapproachable by the axe and triumphing in the pomp and prodigality of nature have in general 63 neither the variety nor beauty which would exist in those of the mountains of britain if left to themselves <\s>
<s> magnificent walnut trees grow upon the plains of switzerland and fine trees of that species are found scattered over the hill sides birches also grow here and there in luxuriant beauty but neither these nor oaks are ever a prevailing tree nor can even be said to be common and the oaks as far as i had an opportunity of observing are greatly inferior to those of britain <\s>
<s> among the interior vallies the proportion of beeches and pines is so great that other trees are scarcely noticeable and surely such woods are at all seasons much less agreeable than that rich and harmonious distribution of oak ash elm birch and alder that formerly clothed the sides of snowdon and helvellyn and of which no mean remains still survive at the head of ulswater <\s>
<s> on the italian side of the alps chesnut and walnut trees grow at a considerable height on the mountains but even there the foliage is not equal in beauty to the natural product of this climate <\s>
<s> in fact the sunshine of the south of europe so envied when heard of at a distance is in many respects injurious to rural beauty particularly as it incites to the cultivation of spots of ground which in colder climates would be left in the hands of nature favouring at the same time the culture of plants that are more valuable on account of the fruit they produce to gratify the palate than for affording pleasure to the eye as materials of landscape <\s>
<s> take for instance the promontory of bellagio so fortunate in its command of the three branches of the lake of como yet the ridge of the promontory itself being for the most part covered with vines interspersed with olive trees accords but ill with the vastness of the green unappropriated mountains and derogates not a little from the sublimity of those finely contrasted pictures to which it is a foreground <\s>
<s> the vine when cultivated upon a large scale notwithstanding all that may be said of it in poetry 64 makes but a dull formal appearance in landscape and the olive tree though one is loth to say so is not more grateful to the eye than our common willow which it much resembles but the hoariness of hue common to both has in the aquatic plant an appropriate delicacy harmonising with the situation in which it most delights <\s>
<s> the same may no doubt be said of the olive among the dry rocks of attica but i am speaking of it as found in gardens and vineyards in the north of italy <\s>
<s> at bellagio what englishman can resist the temptation of substituting in his fancy for these formal treasures of cultivation the natural variety of one of our parks its pastured lawns coverts of hawthorn of wild rose and honeysuckle and the majesty of forest trees such wild graces as the banks of derwent water shewed in the time of the ratcliffes and growbarrow park lowther and rydal do at this day <\s>
<s> 63 the greatest variety of trees is found in the valais <\s>
<s> as my object is to reconcile a briton to the scenery of his own country though not at the expense of truth i am not afraid of asserting that in many points of view our lakes also are much more interesting than those of the alps first as is implied above from being more happily proportioned to the other features of the landscape and next both as being infinitely more pellucid and less subject to agitation from the winds 65 64 lucretius has charmingly described a scene of this kind <\s>
<s> inque dies magis in montem succedere sylvas cogebant infráquo locum coucedere cultis prata lacus rivos segetes vinetaque laeta collibus et campis ut haberent atque olearum caerula distinguens inter plaga currere posset per tumulos et convalleis camposque profusa ut nunc esse vides vario distincta lepore onmia quae pomis intersita dulcibus ornant arbustisque teneut felicibus obsita circúm <\s>
<s> 65 it is remarkable that como as is probably the case with other italian lakes is more troubled by storms in summer than in winter <\s>
<s> hence the propriety of the following verses lari <\s>
<s> margine ubique confragoso nulli coelicolum negas sacellum picto pariete saxeoque tecto hinc miracula multa navitarum audis nee placido refellis ore sed nova usque pavas noto vel euro aestivas quatieutibus cavernas vel surgentis ab adduae cubili caeco grandinis imbre provoluto <\s>
<s> como which may perhaps be styled the king of lakes as lugano is certainly the queen is disturbed by a periodical wind blowing from the head in the morning and towards it in the afternoon <\s>
<s> the magnificent lake of the four cantons especially its noblest division called the lake of uri is not only much agitated by winds but in the night time is disturbed from the bottom as i was told and indeed as i witnessed without any apparent commotion in the air and when at rest the water is not pure to the eye but of a heavy green hue as is that of all the other lakes apparently according to the degree in which they are fed by melted snows <\s>
<s> if the lake of geneva furnish an exception this is probably owing to its vast extent which allows the water to deposit its impurities <\s>
<s> the water of the english lakes on the contrary being of a crystalline clearness the reflections of the surrounding hills are frequently so lively that it is scarcely possible to distinguish the point where the real object terminates and its unsubstantial duplicate begins <\s>
<s> the lower part of the lake of geneva from its narrowness must be much less subject to agitation than the higher divisions and as the water is clearer than that of the other swiss lakes it will frequently exhibit this appearance though it is scarcely possible in an equal degree <\s>
<s> during two comprehensive tours among the alps i did not observe except on one of the smaller lakes between lugano and ponte tresa a single instance of those beautiful repetitions of surrounding objects on the bosom of the water which are so frequently seen here not to speak of the fine dazzling trembling net work breezy motions and streaks and circles of intermingled smooth and rippled water which make the surface of our lakes a field of endless variety <\s>
<s> but among the alps where every thing tends to the grand and the sublime in surfaces as well as in forms if the lakes do not court the placid reflections of land objects those of first rate magnitude make compensation in some degree by exhibiting those ever changing fields of green blue and purple shadows or lights one scarcely knows which to name them that call to mind a sea prospect contemplated from a lofty cliff <\s>
<s> the subject of torrents and waterfalls has already been touched upon but it may be added that in switzerland the perpetual accompaniment of snow upon the higher regions takes much from the effect of foaming white streams while from their frequency they obstruct each other's influence upon the mind of the spectator and in all cases the effect of an individual cataract excepting the great fall of the rhine at schaffhausen is diminished by the general fury of the stream of which it is a part <\s>
<s> recurring to the reflections from still water i will describe a singular phenomenon of this kind of which i was an eye witness <\s>
<s> walking by the side of ulswater upon a calm september morning i saw deep within the bosom of the lake a magnificent castle with towers and battlements nothing could be more distinct than the whole edifice <\s>
<s> after gazing with delight upon it for some time as upon a work of enchantment i could not but regret that my previous knowledge of the place enabled me to account for the appearance <\s>
<s> it was in fact the reflection of a pleasure house called lyulph's tower the towers and battlements magnified and so much changed in shape as not to be immediately recognised <\s>
<s> in the meanwhile the pleasure house itself was altogether hidden from my view by a body of vapour stretching over it and along the hill side on which it stands but not so as to have intercepted its communication with the lake and hence this novel and most impressive object which if i had been a stranger to the spot would from its being inexplicable have long detained the mind in a state of pleasing astonishment <\s>
<s> appearances of this kind acting upon the credulity of early ages may have given birth to and favoured the belief in stories of sub aqueous palaces gardens and pleasure grounds the brilliant ornaments of romance <\s>
<s> with this inverted scene i will couple a much more extraordinary phenomenon which will show how other elegant fancies may have had their origin less in invention than in the actual processes of nature <\s>
<s> about eleven o'clock on the forenoon of a winter's day coming suddenly in company of a friend into view of the lake of grasmere we were alarmed by the sight of a newly created island the transitory thought of the moment was that it had been produced by an earthquake or some other convulsion of nature <\s>

<s> como which may perhaps be styled the king of lakes as lugano is certainly the queen is disturbed by a periodical wind blowing from the head in the morning and towards it in the afternoon <\s>
<s> the magnificent lake of the four cantons especially its noblest division called the lake of uri is not only much agitated by winds but in the night time is disturbed from the bottom as i was told and indeed as i witnessed without any apparent commotion in the air and when at rest the water is not pure to the eye but of a heavy green hue as is that of all the other lakes apparently according to the degree in which they are fed by melted snows <\s>
<s> if the lake of geneva furnish an exception this is probably owing to its vast extent which allows the water to deposit its impurities <\s>
<s> the water of the english lakes on the contrary being of a crystalline clearness the reflections of the surrounding hills are frequently so lively that it is scarcely possible to distinguish the point where the real object terminates and its unsubstantial duplicate begins <\s>
<s> the lower part of the lake of geneva from its narrowness must be much less subject to agitation than the higher divisions and as the water is clearer than that of the other swiss lakes it will frequently exhibit this appearance though it is scarcely possible in an equal degree <\s>
<s> during two comprehensive tours among the alps i did not observe except on one of the smaller lakes between lugano and ponte tresa a single instance of those beautiful repetitions of surrounding objects on the bosom of the water which are so frequently seen here not to speak of the fine dazzling trembling net work breezy motions and streaks and circles of intermingled smooth and rippled water which make the surface of our lakes a field of endless variety <\s>
<s> but among the alps where every thing tends to the grand and the sublime in surfaces as well as in forms if the lakes do not court the placid reflections of land objects those of first rate magnitude make compensation in some degree by exhibiting those ever changing fields of green blue and purple shadows or lights one scarcely knows which to name them that call to mind a sea prospect contemplated from a lofty cliff <\s>
<s> the subject of torrents and waterfalls has already been touched upon but it may be added that in switzerland the perpetual accompaniment of snow upon the higher regions takes much from the effect of foaming white streams while from their frequency they obstruct each other's influence upon the mind of the spectator and in all cases the effect of an individual cataract excepting the great fall of the rhine at schaffhausen is diminished by the general fury of the stream of which it is a part <\s>
<s> recurring to the reflections from still water i will describe a singular phenomenon of this kind of which i was an eye witness <\s>
<s> walking by the side of ulswater upon a calm september morning i saw deep within the bosom of the lake a magnificent castle with towers and battlements nothing could be more distinct than the whole edifice <\s>
<s> after gazing with delight upon it for some time as upon a work of enchantment i could not but regret that my previous knowledge of the place enabled me to account for the appearance <\s>
<s> it was in fact the reflection of a pleasure house called lyulph's tower the towers and battlements magnified and so much changed in shape as not to be immediately recognised <\s>
<s> in the meanwhile the pleasure house itself was altogether hidden from my view by a body of vapour stretching over it and along the hill side on which it stands but not so as to have intercepted its communication with the lake and hence this novel and most impressive object which if i had been a stranger to the spot would from its being inexplicable have long detained the mind in a state of pleasing astonishment <\s>
<s> appearances of this kind acting upon the credulity of early ages may have given birth to and favoured the belief in stories of sub aqueous palaces gardens and pleasure grounds the brilliant ornaments of romance <\s>
<s> with this inverted scene i will couple a much more extraordinary phenomenon which will show how other elegant fancies may have had their origin less in invention than in the actual processes of nature <\s>
<s> about eleven o'clock on the forenoon of a winter's day coming suddenly in company of a friend into view of the lake of grasmere we were alarmed by the sight of a newly created island the transitory thought of the moment was that it had been produced by an earthquake or some other convulsion of nature <\s>
<s> recovering from the alarm which was greater than the reader can possibly sympathise with but which was shared to its full extent by my companion we proceeded to examine the object before us <\s>
<s> the elevation of this new island exceeded considerably that of the old one its neighbour it was likewise larger in circumference comprehending a space of about five acres its surface rocky speckled with snow and sprinkled over with birch trees it was divided towards the south from the other island by a narrow frith and in like manner from the northern shore of the lake on the east and west it was separated from the shore by a much larger space of smooth water <\s>
<s> marvellous was the illusion <\s>
<s> comparing the new with the old island the surface of which is soft green and unvaried i do not scruple to say that as an object of sight it was much the more distinct <\s>
<s> how little faith we exclaimed is due to one sense unless its evidence be confirmed by some of its fellows <\s>
<s> what stranger could possibly be persuaded that this which we know to be an unsubstantial mockery is really so and that there exists only a single island on this beautiful lake <\s>
<s> at length the appearance underwent a gradual transmutation it lost its prominence and passed into a glimmering and dim inversion and then totally disappeared leaving behind it a clear open area of ice of the same dimensions <\s>
<s> we now perceived that this bed of ice which was thinly suffused with water had produced the illusion by reflecting and refracting as persons skilled in optics would no doubt easily explain a rocky and woody section of the opposite mountain named silver how <\s>
<s> having dwelt so much upon the beauty of pure and still water and pointed out the advantage which the lakes of the north of england have in this particular over those of the alps it would be injustice not to advert to the sublimity that must often be given to alpine scenes by the agitations to which those vast bodies of diffused water are there subject <\s>
<s> i have witnessed many tremendous thunder storms among the alps and the most glorious effects of light and shadow but i never happened to be present when any lake was agitated by those hurricanes which i imagine must often torment them <\s>
<s> if the commotions be at all proportionable to the expanse and depth of the waters and the height of the surrounding mountains then if i may judge from what is frequently seen here the exhibition must be awful and astonishing on this day march 30 1822 the winds have been acting upon the small lake of rydal as if they had received command to carry its waters from their bed into the sky the white billows in different quarters disappeared under clouds or rather drifts of spray that were whirled along and up into the air by scouring winds charging each other in squadrons in every direction upon the lake <\s>
<s> the spray having been hurried aloft till it lost its consistency and whiteness was driven along the mountain tops like flying showers that vanish in the distance <\s>
<s> frequently an eddying wind scooped the waters out of the basin and forced them upwards in the very shape of an icelandic geyser or boiling fountain to the height of several hundred feet <\s>
<s> this small mere of rydal from its position is subject in a peculiar degree to these commotions <\s>
<s> the present season however is unusually stormy great numbers of fish two of them not less than 12 pounds weight were a few days ago cast on the shores of derwent water by the force of the waves <\s>
<s> lest in the foregoing comparative estimate i should be suspected of partiality to my native mountains i will support my general opinion by the authority of mr <\s>
<s> west whose guide to the lakes has been eminently serviceable to the tourist for nearly 50 years <\s>
<s> the author a roman catholic clergyman had passed much time abroad and was well acquainted with the scenery of the continent <\s>
<s> he thus expresses himself they who intend to make the continental tour should begin here as it will give in miniature an idea of what they are to meet with there in traversing the alps and appenines to which our northern mountains are not inferior in beauty of line or variety of summit number of lakes and transparency of water not in colouring of rock or softness of turf but in height and extent only <\s>
<s> the mountains here are all accessible to the summit and furnish prospects no less surprising and with more variety than the alps themselves <\s>
<s> for no traveller provided he be in good health and with any command of time would have a just privilege to visit such scenes if he could grudge the price of a little confinement among them or interruption in his journey for the sight or sound of a storm coming on or clearing away <\s>
<s> insensible must he be who would not congratulate himself upon the bold bursts of sunshine the descending vapours wandering lights and shadows and the invigorated torrents and waterfalls with which broken weather in a mountainous region is accompanied <\s>
<s> at such a time there is no cause to complain either of the monotony of midsummer colouring or the glaring atmosphere of long cloudless and hot days <\s>
<s> thus far concerning the respective advantages and disadvantages of the different seasons for visiting this country <\s>
<s> as to the order in which objects are best seen a lake being composed of water flowing from higher grounds and expanding itself till its receptacle is filled to the brim it follows that it will appear to most advantage when approached from its outlet especially if the lake be in a mountainous country for by this way of approach the traveller faces the grander features of the scene and is gradually conducted into its most sublime recesses <\s>
<s> now every one knows that from amenity and beauty the transition to sublimity is easy and favourable but the reverse is not so for after the faculties have been elevated they are indisposed to humbler excitement 62 62 the only instances to which the foregoing observations do not apply are derwent water and lowes water <\s>
<s> derwent is distinguished from all the other lakes by being surrounded with sublimity the fantastic mountains of borrowdale to the south the solitary majesty of skiddaw to the north the bold steeps of wallow crag and lodore to the east and to the west the clustering mountains of newlands <\s>
<s> lowes water is tame at the head but towards its outlet has a magnificent assemblage of mountains <\s>
<s> yet as far as respects the formation of such receptacles the general observation holds good neither derwent nor lowes water derive any supplies from the streams of those mountains that dignify the landscape towards the outlets <\s>
<s> it is not likely that a mountain will be ascended without disappointment if a wide range of prospect be the object unless either the summit be reached before sun rise or the visitant remain there until the time of sun set and afterwards <\s>
<s> the precipitous sides of the mountain and the neighbouring summits may be seen with effect under any atmosphere which allows them to be seen at all but he is the most fortunate adventurer who chances to be involved in vapours which open and let in an extent of country partially or dispersing suddenly reveal the whole region from centre to circumference <\s>
<s> a stranger to a mountainous country may not be aware that his walk in the early morning ought to be taken on the eastern side of the vale otherwise he will lose the morning light first touching the tops and thence creeping down the sides of the opposite hills as the sun ascends or he may go to some central eminence commanding both the shadows from the eastern and the lights upon the western mountains <\s>
<s> but if the horizon line in the east be low the western side may be taken for the sake of the reflections upon the water of light from the rising sun <\s>
<s> in the evening for like reasons the contrary course should be taken <\s>
<s> after all it is upon the mind which a traveller brings along with him that his acquisitions whether of pleasure or profit must principally depend may i be allowed a few words on this subject <\s>
<s> nothing is more injurious to genuine feeling than the practice of hastily and ungraciously depreciating the face of one country by comparing it with that of another <\s>
<s> true it is qui bene distinguit bene docet yet fastidiousness is a wretched travelling companion and the best guide to which in matters of taste we can entrust ourselves is a disposition to be pleased <\s>
<s> for example if a traveller be among the alps let him surrender up his mind to the fury of the gigantic torrents and take delight in the contemplation of their almost irresistible violence without complaining of the monotony of their foaming course or being disgusted with the muddiness of the water apparent even where it is violently agitated <\s>
<s> in cumberland and westmoreland let not the comparative weakness of the streams prevent him from sympathising with such impetuosity as they possess and making the most of the present objects let him as he justly may do observe with admiration the unrivalled brilliancy of the water and that variety of motion mood and character that arises out of the want of those resources by which the power of the streams in the alps is supported again with respect to the mountains though these are comparatively of diminutive size though there is little of perpetual snow and no voice of summer avalanches is heard among them and though traces left by the ravage of the elements are here comparatively rare and unimpressive yet out of this very deficiency proceeds a sense of stability and permanence that is to many minds more grateful while the hoarse rushes to the sweeping breeze sigh forth their ancient melodies <\s>
<s> among the alps are few places that do not preclude this feeling of tranquil sublimity <\s>
<s> havoc and ruin and desolation and encroachment are everywhere more or less obtruded and it is difficult notwithstanding the naked loftiness of the pikes and the snow capped summits of the mounts to escape from the depressing sensation that the whole are in a rapid process of dissolution and were it not that the destructive agency must abate as the heights diminish would in time to come be levelled with the plains <\s>
<s> nevertheless i would relish to the utmost the demonstrations of every species of power at work to effect such changes <\s>
<s> from these general views let us descend a moment to detail <\s>
<s> a stranger to mountain imagery naturally on his first arrival looks out for sublimity in every object that admits of it and is almost always disappointed <\s>
<s> for this disappointment there exists i believe no general preventive nor is it desirable that there should <\s>
<s> but with regard to one class of objects there is a point in which injurious expectations may be easily corrected <\s>
<s> it is generally supposed that waterfalls are scarcely worth being looked at except after much rain and that the more swoln the stream the more fortunate the spectator but this however is true only of large cataracts with sublime accompaniments and not even of these without some drawbacks <\s>
<s> in other instances what becomes at such a time of that sense of refreshing coolness which can only be felt in dry and sunny weather when the rocks herbs and flowers glisten with moisture diffused by the breath of the precipitous water <\s>
<s> but considering these things as objects of sight only it may be observed that the principal charm of the smaller waterfalls or cascades consists in certain proportions of form and affinities of colour among the component parts of the scene and in the contrast maintained between the falling water and that which is apparently at rest or rather settling gradually into quiet in the pool below <\s>
<s> the beauty of such a scene where there is naturally so much agitation is also heightened in a peculiar manner by the glimmering and towards the verge of the pool by the steady reflection of the surrounding images <\s>
<s> now all those delicate distinctions are destroyed by heavy floods and the whole stream rushes along in foam and tumultuous confusion <\s>
<s> a happy proportion of component parts is indeed noticeable among the landscapes of the north of england and in this characteristic essential to a perfect picture they surpass the scenes of scotland and in a still greater degree those of switzerland <\s>

<s> now every one knows that from amenity and beauty the transition to sublimity is easy and favourable but the reverse is not so for after the faculties have been elevated they are indisposed to humbler excitement 62 62 the only instances to which the foregoing observations do not apply are derwent water and lowes water <\s>
<s> derwent is distinguished from all the other lakes by being surrounded with sublimity the fantastic mountains of borrowdale to the south the solitary majesty of skiddaw to the north the bold steeps of wallow crag and lodore to the east and to the west the clustering mountains of newlands <\s>

<s> yet as far as respects the formation of such receptacles the general observation holds good neither derwent nor lowes water derive any supplies from the streams of those mountains that dignify the landscape towards the outlets <\s>
<s> it is not likely that a mountain will be ascended without disappointment if a wide range of prospect be the object unless either the summit be reached before sun rise or the visitant remain there until the time of sun set and afterwards <\s>
<s> the precipitous sides of the mountain and the neighbouring summits may be seen with effect under any atmosphere which allows them to be seen at all but he is the most fortunate adventurer who chances to be involved in vapours which open and let in an extent of country partially or dispersing suddenly reveal the whole region from centre to circumference <\s>
<s> a stranger to a mountainous country may not be aware that his walk in the early morning ought to be taken on the eastern side of the vale otherwise he will lose the morning light first touching the tops and thence creeping down the sides of the opposite hills as the sun ascends or he may go to some central eminence commanding both the shadows from the eastern and the lights upon the western mountains <\s>
<s> but if the horizon line in the east be low the western side may be taken for the sake of the reflections upon the water of light from the rising sun <\s>
<s> in the evening for like reasons the contrary course should be taken <\s>
<s> after all it is upon the mind which a traveller brings along with him that his acquisitions whether of pleasure or profit must principally depend may i be allowed a few words on this subject <\s>
<s> nothing is more injurious to genuine feeling than the practice of hastily and ungraciously depreciating the face of one country by comparing it with that of another <\s>
<s> true it is qui bene distinguit bene docet yet fastidiousness is a wretched travelling companion and the best guide to which in matters of taste we can entrust ourselves is a disposition to be pleased <\s>
<s> for example if a traveller be among the alps let him surrender up his mind to the fury of the gigantic torrents and take delight in the contemplation of their almost irresistible violence without complaining of the monotony of their foaming course or being disgusted with the muddiness of the water apparent even where it is violently agitated <\s>
<s> in cumberland and westmoreland let not the comparative weakness of the streams prevent him from sympathising with such impetuosity as they possess and making the most of the present objects let him as he justly may do observe with admiration the unrivalled brilliancy of the water and that variety of motion mood and character that arises out of the want of those resources by which the power of the streams in the alps is supported again with respect to the mountains though these are comparatively of diminutive size though there is little of perpetual snow and no voice of summer avalanches is heard among them and though traces left by the ravage of the elements are here comparatively rare and unimpressive yet out of this very deficiency proceeds a sense of stability and permanence that is to many minds more grateful while the hoarse rushes to the sweeping breeze sigh forth their ancient melodies <\s>
<s> among the alps are few places that do not preclude this feeling of tranquil sublimity <\s>
<s> havoc and ruin and desolation and encroachment are everywhere more or less obtruded and it is difficult notwithstanding the naked loftiness of the pikes and the snow capped summits of the mounts to escape from the depressing sensation that the whole are in a rapid process of dissolution and were it not that the destructive agency must abate as the heights diminish would in time to come be levelled with the plains <\s>
<s> nevertheless i would relish to the utmost the demonstrations of every species of power at work to effect such changes <\s>
<s> from these general views let us descend a moment to detail <\s>
<s> a stranger to mountain imagery naturally on his first arrival looks out for sublimity in every object that admits of it and is almost always disappointed <\s>
<s> for this disappointment there exists i believe no general preventive nor is it desirable that there should <\s>
<s> but with regard to one class of objects there is a point in which injurious expectations may be easily corrected <\s>
<s> it is generally supposed that waterfalls are scarcely worth being looked at except after much rain and that the more swoln the stream the more fortunate the spectator but this however is true only of large cataracts with sublime accompaniments and not even of these without some drawbacks <\s>
<s> in other instances what becomes at such a time of that sense of refreshing coolness which can only be felt in dry and sunny weather when the rocks herbs and flowers glisten with moisture diffused by the breath of the precipitous water <\s>
<s> but considering these things as objects of sight only it may be observed that the principal charm of the smaller waterfalls or cascades consists in certain proportions of form and affinities of colour among the component parts of the scene and in the contrast maintained between the falling water and that which is apparently at rest or rather settling gradually into quiet in the pool below <\s>
<s> the beauty of such a scene where there is naturally so much agitation is also heightened in a peculiar manner by the glimmering and towards the verge of the pool by the steady reflection of the surrounding images <\s>
<s> now all those delicate distinctions are destroyed by heavy floods and the whole stream rushes along in foam and tumultuous confusion <\s>
<s> a happy proportion of component parts is indeed noticeable among the landscapes of the north of england and in this characteristic essential to a perfect picture they surpass the scenes of scotland and in a still greater degree those of switzerland <\s>
<s> as a resident among the lakes i frequently hear the scenery of this country compared with that of the alps and therefore a few words shall be added to what has been incidentally said upon that subject <\s>
<s> if we could recall to this region of lakes the native pine forests with which many hundred years ago a large portion of the heights was covered then during spring and autumn it might frequently with much propriety be compared to switzerland the elements of the landscape would be the same one country representing the other in miniature <\s>
<s> towns villages churches rural seats bridges and roads green meadows and arable grounds with their various produce and deciduous woods of diversified foliage which occupy the vales and lower regions of the mountains would as in switzerland be divided by dark forests from ridges and round topped heights covered with snow and from pikes and sharp declivities imperfectly arrayed in the same glittering mantle and the resemblance would be still more perfect on those days when vapours resting upon and floating around the summits leave the elevation of the mountains less dependent upon the eye than on the imagination <\s>
<s> but the pine forests have wholly disappeared and only during late spring and early autumn is realised here that assemblage of the imagery of different seasons which is exhibited through the whole summer among the alps winter in the distance and warmth leafy woods verdure and fertility at hand and widely diffused <\s>
<s> striking then from among the permanent materials of the landscape that stage of vegetation which is occupied by pine forests and above that the perennial snows we have mountains the highest of which little exceed 3000 feet while some of the alps do not fall short of 14,000 or 15,000 and 8000 or 10,000 is not an uncommon elevation <\s>
<s> our tracts of wood and water are almost diminutive in comparison therefore as far as sublimity is dependent upon absolute bulk and height and atmospherical influences in connection with these it is obvious that there can be no rivalship <\s>
<s> but a short residence among the british mountains will furnish abundant proof that after a certain point of elevation viz <\s>
<s> that which allows of compact and fleecy clouds settling upon or sweeping over the summits the sense of sublimity depends more upon form and relation of objects to each other than upon their actual magnitude and that an elevation of 3000 feet is sufficient to call forth in a most impressive degree the creative and magnifying and softening powers of the atmosphere <\s>
<s> hence on the score even of sublimity the superiority of the alps is by no means so great as might hastily be inferred and as to the beauty of the lower regions of the swiss mountains it is noticeable that as they are all regularly mown their surface has nothing of that mellow tone and variety of hues by which mountain turf that is never touched by the scythe is distinguished <\s>
<s> on the smooth and steep slopes of the swiss hills these plots of verdure do indeed agreeably unite their colour with that of the deciduous trees or make a lively contrast with the dark green pine groves that define them and among which they run in endless variety of shapes but this is most pleasing at first sight the permanent gratification of the eye requires finer gradations of tone and a more delicate blending of hues into each other <\s>
<s> besides it is only in spring and late autumn that cattle animate by their presence the swiss lawns and though the pastures of the higher regions where they feed during the summer are left in their natural state of flowery herbage those pastures are so remote that their texture and colour are of no consequence in the composition of any picture in which a lake of the vales is a feature <\s>
<s> yet in those lofty regions how vegetation is invigorated by the genial climate of that country <\s>
<s> among the luxuriant flowers there met with groves or forests if i may so call them of monks hood are frequently seen the plant of deep rich blue and as tall as in our gardens and this at an elevation where in cumberland icelandic moss would only be found or the stony summits be utterly bare <\s>
<s> we have then for the colouring of switzerland principally a vivid green herbage black woods and dazzling snows presented in masses with a grandeur to which no one can be insensible but not often graduated by nature into soothing harmony and so ill suited to the pencil that though abundance of good subjects may be there found they are not such as can be deemed characteristic of the country nor is this unfitness confined to colour the forms of the mountains though many of them in some points of view the noblest that can be conceived are apt to run into spikes and needles and present a jagged outline which has a mean effect transferred to canvass <\s>
<s> this must have been felt by the ancient masters for if i am not mistaken they have not left a single landscape the materials of which are taken from the peculiar features of the alps yet titian passed his life almost in their neighbourhood the poussins and claude must have been well acquainted with their aspects and several admirable painters as tibaldi and luino were born among the italian alps <\s>
<s> a few experiments have lately been made by englishmen but they only prove that courage skill and judgment may surmount any obstacles and it may be safely affirmed that they who have done best in this bold adventure will be the least likely to repeat the attempt <\s>
<s> but though our scenes are better suited to painting than those of the alps i should be sorry to contemplate either country in reference to that art further than as its fitness or unfitness for the pencil renders it more or less pleasing to the eye of the spectator who has learned to observe and feel chiefly from nature herself <\s>
<s> deeming the points in which alpine imagery is superior to british too obvious to be insisted upon i will observe that the deciduous woods though in many places unapproachable by the axe and triumphing in the pomp and prodigality of nature have in general 63 neither the variety nor beauty which would exist in those of the mountains of britain if left to themselves <\s>
<s> magnificent walnut trees grow upon the plains of switzerland and fine trees of that species are found scattered over the hill sides birches also grow here and there in luxuriant beauty but neither these nor oaks are ever a prevailing tree nor can even be said to be common and the oaks as far as i had an opportunity of observing are greatly inferior to those of britain <\s>
<s> among the interior vallies the proportion of beeches and pines is so great that other trees are scarcely noticeable and surely such woods are at all seasons much less agreeable than that rich and harmonious distribution of oak ash elm birch and alder that formerly clothed the sides of snowdon and helvellyn and of which no mean remains still survive at the head of ulswater <\s>
<s> on the italian side of the alps chesnut and walnut trees grow at a considerable height on the mountains but even there the foliage is not equal in beauty to the natural product of this climate <\s>
<s> in fact the sunshine of the south of europe so envied when heard of at a distance is in many respects injurious to rural beauty particularly as it incites to the cultivation of spots of ground which in colder climates would be left in the hands of nature favouring at the same time the culture of plants that are more valuable on account of the fruit they produce to gratify the palate than for affording pleasure to the eye as materials of landscape <\s>
<s> take for instance the promontory of bellagio so fortunate in its command of the three branches of the lake of como yet the ridge of the promontory itself being for the most part covered with vines interspersed with olive trees accords but ill with the vastness of the green unappropriated mountains and derogates not a little from the sublimity of those finely contrasted pictures to which it is a foreground <\s>
<s> the vine when cultivated upon a large scale notwithstanding all that may be said of it in poetry 64 makes but a dull formal appearance in landscape and the olive tree though one is loth to say so is not more grateful to the eye than our common willow which it much resembles but the hoariness of hue common to both has in the aquatic plant an appropriate delicacy harmonising with the situation in which it most delights <\s>
<s> the same may no doubt be said of the olive among the dry rocks of attica but i am speaking of it as found in gardens and vineyards in the north of italy <\s>
<s> at bellagio what englishman can resist the temptation of substituting in his fancy for these formal treasures of cultivation the natural variety of one of our parks its pastured lawns coverts of hawthorn of wild rose and honeysuckle and the majesty of forest trees such wild graces as the banks of derwent water shewed in the time of the ratcliffes and growbarrow park lowther and rydal do at this day <\s>
<s> 63 the greatest variety of trees is found in the valais <\s>
<s> as my object is to reconcile a briton to the scenery of his own country though not at the expense of truth i am not afraid of asserting that in many points of view our lakes also are much more interesting than those of the alps first as is implied above from being more happily proportioned to the other features of the landscape and next both as being infinitely more pellucid and less subject to agitation from the winds 65 64 lucretius has charmingly described a scene of this kind <\s>
<s> inque dies magis in montem succedere sylvas cogebant infráquo locum coucedere cultis prata lacus rivos segetes vinetaque laeta collibus et campis ut haberent atque olearum caerula distinguens inter plaga currere posset per tumulos et convalleis camposque profusa ut nunc esse vides vario distincta lepore onmia quae pomis intersita dulcibus ornant arbustisque teneut felicibus obsita circúm <\s>
<s> 65 it is remarkable that como as is probably the case with other italian lakes is more troubled by storms in summer than in winter <\s>

<s> but considering these things as objects of sight only it may be observed that the principal charm of the smaller waterfalls or cascades consists in certain proportions of form and affinities of colour among the component parts of the scene and in the contrast maintained between the falling water and that which is apparently at rest or rather settling gradually into quiet in the pool below <\s>
<s> the beauty of such a scene where there is naturally so much agitation is also heightened in a peculiar manner by the glimmering and towards the verge of the pool by the steady reflection of the surrounding images <\s>

<s> a happy proportion of component parts is indeed noticeable among the landscapes of the north of england and in this characteristic essential to a perfect picture they surpass the scenes of scotland and in a still greater degree those of switzerland <\s>
<s> as a resident among the lakes i frequently hear the scenery of this country compared with that of the alps and therefore a few words shall be added to what has been incidentally said upon that subject <\s>
<s> if we could recall to this region of lakes the native pine forests with which many hundred years ago a large portion of the heights was covered then during spring and autumn it might frequently with much propriety be compared to switzerland the elements of the landscape would be the same one country representing the other in miniature <\s>

<s> but the pine forests have wholly disappeared and only during late spring and early autumn is realised here that assemblage of the imagery of different seasons which is exhibited through the whole summer among the alps winter in the distance and warmth leafy woods verdure and fertility at hand and widely diffused <\s>
<s> striking then from among the permanent materials of the landscape that stage of vegetation which is occupied by pine forests and above that the perennial snows we have mountains the highest of which little exceed 3000 feet while some of the alps do not fall short of 14,000 or 15,000 and 8000 or 10,000 is not an uncommon elevation <\s>
<s> our tracts of wood and water are almost diminutive in comparison therefore as far as sublimity is dependent upon absolute bulk and height and atmospherical influences in connection with these it is obvious that there can be no rivalship <\s>
<s> but a short residence among the british mountains will furnish abundant proof that after a certain point of elevation viz <\s>
<s> that which allows of compact and fleecy clouds settling upon or sweeping over the summits the sense of sublimity depends more upon form and relation of objects to each other than upon their actual magnitude and that an elevation of 3000 feet is sufficient to call forth in a most impressive degree the creative and magnifying and softening powers of the atmosphere <\s>
<s> hence on the score even of sublimity the superiority of the alps is by no means so great as might hastily be inferred and as to the beauty of the lower regions of the swiss mountains it is noticeable that as they are all regularly mown their surface has nothing of that mellow tone and variety of hues by which mountain turf that is never touched by the scythe is distinguished <\s>
<s> on the smooth and steep slopes of the swiss hills these plots of verdure do indeed agreeably unite their colour with that of the deciduous trees or make a lively contrast with the dark green pine groves that define them and among which they run in endless variety of shapes but this is most pleasing at first sight the permanent gratification of the eye requires finer gradations of tone and a more delicate blending of hues into each other <\s>
<s> besides it is only in spring and late autumn that cattle animate by their presence the swiss lawns and though the pastures of the higher regions where they feed during the summer are left in their natural state of flowery herbage those pastures are so remote that their texture and colour are of no consequence in the composition of any picture in which a lake of the vales is a feature <\s>
<s> yet in those lofty regions how vegetation is invigorated by the genial climate of that country <\s>
<s> among the luxuriant flowers there met with groves or forests if i may so call them of monks hood are frequently seen the plant of deep rich blue and as tall as in our gardens and this at an elevation where in cumberland icelandic moss would only be found or the stony summits be utterly bare <\s>
<s> we have then for the colouring of switzerland principally a vivid green herbage black woods and dazzling snows presented in masses with a grandeur to which no one can be insensible but not often graduated by nature into soothing harmony and so ill suited to the pencil that though abundance of good subjects may be there found they are not such as can be deemed characteristic of the country nor is this unfitness confined to colour the forms of the mountains though many of them in some points of view the noblest that can be conceived are apt to run into spikes and needles and present a jagged outline which has a mean effect transferred to canvass <\s>
<s> this must have been felt by the ancient masters for if i am not mistaken they have not left a single landscape the materials of which are taken from the peculiar features of the alps yet titian passed his life almost in their neighbourhood the poussins and claude must have been well acquainted with their aspects and several admirable painters as tibaldi and luino were born among the italian alps <\s>
<s> a few experiments have lately been made by englishmen but they only prove that courage skill and judgment may surmount any obstacles and it may be safely affirmed that they who have done best in this bold adventure will be the least likely to repeat the attempt <\s>
<s> but though our scenes are better suited to painting than those of the alps i should be sorry to contemplate either country in reference to that art further than as its fitness or unfitness for the pencil renders it more or less pleasing to the eye of the spectator who has learned to observe and feel chiefly from nature herself <\s>
<s> deeming the points in which alpine imagery is superior to british too obvious to be insisted upon i will observe that the deciduous woods though in many places unapproachable by the axe and triumphing in the pomp and prodigality of nature have in general 63 neither the variety nor beauty which would exist in those of the mountains of britain if left to themselves <\s>
<s> magnificent walnut trees grow upon the plains of switzerland and fine trees of that species are found scattered over the hill sides birches also grow here and there in luxuriant beauty but neither these nor oaks are ever a prevailing tree nor can even be said to be common and the oaks as far as i had an opportunity of observing are greatly inferior to those of britain <\s>
<s> among the interior vallies the proportion of beeches and pines is so great that other trees are scarcely noticeable and surely such woods are at all seasons much less agreeable than that rich and harmonious distribution of oak ash elm birch and alder that formerly clothed the sides of snowdon and helvellyn and of which no mean remains still survive at the head of ulswater <\s>
<s> on the italian side of the alps chesnut and walnut trees grow at a considerable height on the mountains but even there the foliage is not equal in beauty to the natural product of this climate <\s>
<s> in fact the sunshine of the south of europe so envied when heard of at a distance is in many respects injurious to rural beauty particularly as it incites to the cultivation of spots of ground which in colder climates would be left in the hands of nature favouring at the same time the culture of plants that are more valuable on account of the fruit they produce to gratify the palate than for affording pleasure to the eye as materials of landscape <\s>
<s> take for instance the promontory of bellagio so fortunate in its command of the three branches of the lake of como yet the ridge of the promontory itself being for the most part covered with vines interspersed with olive trees accords but ill with the vastness of the green unappropriated mountains and derogates not a little from the sublimity of those finely contrasted pictures to which it is a foreground <\s>
<s> the vine when cultivated upon a large scale notwithstanding all that may be said of it in poetry 64 makes but a dull formal appearance in landscape and the olive tree though one is loth to say so is not more grateful to the eye than our common willow which it much resembles but the hoariness of hue common to both has in the aquatic plant an appropriate delicacy harmonising with the situation in which it most delights <\s>
<s> the same may no doubt be said of the olive among the dry rocks of attica but i am speaking of it as found in gardens and vineyards in the north of italy <\s>
<s> at bellagio what englishman can resist the temptation of substituting in his fancy for these formal treasures of cultivation the natural variety of one of our parks its pastured lawns coverts of hawthorn of wild rose and honeysuckle and the majesty of forest trees such wild graces as the banks of derwent water shewed in the time of the ratcliffes and growbarrow park lowther and rydal do at this day <\s>
<s> 63 the greatest variety of trees is found in the valais <\s>
<s> as my object is to reconcile a briton to the scenery of his own country though not at the expense of truth i am not afraid of asserting that in many points of view our lakes also are much more interesting than those of the alps first as is implied above from being more happily proportioned to the other features of the landscape and next both as being infinitely more pellucid and less subject to agitation from the winds 65 64 lucretius has charmingly described a scene of this kind <\s>
<s> inque dies magis in montem succedere sylvas cogebant infráquo locum coucedere cultis prata lacus rivos segetes vinetaque laeta collibus et campis ut haberent atque olearum caerula distinguens inter plaga currere posset per tumulos et convalleis camposque profusa ut nunc esse vides vario distincta lepore onmia quae pomis intersita dulcibus ornant arbustisque teneut felicibus obsita circúm <\s>
<s> 65 it is remarkable that como as is probably the case with other italian lakes is more troubled by storms in summer than in winter <\s>
<s> hence the propriety of the following verses lari <\s>
<s> margine ubique confragoso nulli coelicolum negas sacellum picto pariete saxeoque tecto hinc miracula multa navitarum audis nee placido refellis ore sed nova usque pavas noto vel euro aestivas quatieutibus cavernas vel surgentis ab adduae cubili caeco grandinis imbre provoluto <\s>
<s> como which may perhaps be styled the king of lakes as lugano is certainly the queen is disturbed by a periodical wind blowing from the head in the morning and towards it in the afternoon <\s>
<s> the magnificent lake of the four cantons especially its noblest division called the lake of uri is not only much agitated by winds but in the night time is disturbed from the bottom as i was told and indeed as i witnessed without any apparent commotion in the air and when at rest the water is not pure to the eye but of a heavy green hue as is that of all the other lakes apparently according to the degree in which they are fed by melted snows <\s>
<s> if the lake of geneva furnish an exception this is probably owing to its vast extent which allows the water to deposit its impurities <\s>
<s> the water of the english lakes on the contrary being of a crystalline clearness the reflections of the surrounding hills are frequently so lively that it is scarcely possible to distinguish the point where the real object terminates and its unsubstantial duplicate begins <\s>
<s> the lower part of the lake of geneva from its narrowness must be much less subject to agitation than the higher divisions and as the water is clearer than that of the other swiss lakes it will frequently exhibit this appearance though it is scarcely possible in an equal degree <\s>
<s> during two comprehensive tours among the alps i did not observe except on one of the smaller lakes between lugano and ponte tresa a single instance of those beautiful repetitions of surrounding objects on the bosom of the water which are so frequently seen here not to speak of the fine dazzling trembling net work breezy motions and streaks and circles of intermingled smooth and rippled water which make the surface of our lakes a field of endless variety <\s>
<s> but among the alps where every thing tends to the grand and the sublime in surfaces as well as in forms if the lakes do not court the placid reflections of land objects those of first rate magnitude make compensation in some degree by exhibiting those ever changing fields of green blue and purple shadows or lights one scarcely knows which to name them that call to mind a sea prospect contemplated from a lofty cliff <\s>
<s> the subject of torrents and waterfalls has already been touched upon but it may be added that in switzerland the perpetual accompaniment of snow upon the higher regions takes much from the effect of foaming white streams while from their frequency they obstruct each other's influence upon the mind of the spectator and in all cases the effect of an individual cataract excepting the great fall of the rhine at schaffhausen is diminished by the general fury of the stream of which it is a part <\s>
<s> recurring to the reflections from still water i will describe a singular phenomenon of this kind of which i was an eye witness <\s>
<s> walking by the side of ulswater upon a calm september morning i saw deep within the bosom of the lake a magnificent castle with towers and battlements nothing could be more distinct than the whole edifice <\s>
<s> after gazing with delight upon it for some time as upon a work of enchantment i could not but regret that my previous knowledge of the place enabled me to account for the appearance <\s>
<s> it was in fact the reflection of a pleasure house called lyulph's tower the towers and battlements magnified and so much changed in shape as not to be immediately recognised <\s>
<s> in the meanwhile the pleasure house itself was altogether hidden from my view by a body of vapour stretching over it and along the hill side on which it stands but not so as to have intercepted its communication with the lake and hence this novel and most impressive object which if i had been a stranger to the spot would from its being inexplicable have long detained the mind in a state of pleasing astonishment <\s>
<s> appearances of this kind acting upon the credulity of early ages may have given birth to and favoured the belief in stories of sub aqueous palaces gardens and pleasure grounds the brilliant ornaments of romance <\s>
<s> with this inverted scene i will couple a much more extraordinary phenomenon which will show how other elegant fancies may have had their origin less in invention than in the actual processes of nature <\s>
<s> about eleven o'clock on the forenoon of a winter's day coming suddenly in company of a friend into view of the lake of grasmere we were alarmed by the sight of a newly created island the transitory thought of the moment was that it had been produced by an earthquake or some other convulsion of nature <\s>
<s> recovering from the alarm which was greater than the reader can possibly sympathise with but which was shared to its full extent by my companion we proceeded to examine the object before us <\s>
<s> the elevation of this new island exceeded considerably that of the old one its neighbour it was likewise larger in circumference comprehending a space of about five acres its surface rocky speckled with snow and sprinkled over with birch trees it was divided towards the south from the other island by a narrow frith and in like manner from the northern shore of the lake on the east and west it was separated from the shore by a much larger space of smooth water <\s>
<s> marvellous was the illusion <\s>
<s> comparing the new with the old island the surface of which is soft green and unvaried i do not scruple to say that as an object of sight it was much the more distinct <\s>
<s> how little faith we exclaimed is due to one sense unless its evidence be confirmed by some of its fellows <\s>
<s> what stranger could possibly be persuaded that this which we know to be an unsubstantial mockery is really so and that there exists only a single island on this beautiful lake <\s>
<s> at length the appearance underwent a gradual transmutation it lost its prominence and passed into a glimmering and dim inversion and then totally disappeared leaving behind it a clear open area of ice of the same dimensions <\s>
<s> we now perceived that this bed of ice which was thinly suffused with water had produced the illusion by reflecting and refracting as persons skilled in optics would no doubt easily explain a rocky and woody section of the opposite mountain named silver how <\s>
<s> having dwelt so much upon the beauty of pure and still water and pointed out the advantage which the lakes of the north of england have in this particular over those of the alps it would be injustice not to advert to the sublimity that must often be given to alpine scenes by the agitations to which those vast bodies of diffused water are there subject <\s>
<s> i have witnessed many tremendous thunder storms among the alps and the most glorious effects of light and shadow but i never happened to be present when any lake was agitated by those hurricanes which i imagine must often torment them <\s>
<s> if the commotions be at all proportionable to the expanse and depth of the waters and the height of the surrounding mountains then if i may judge from what is frequently seen here the exhibition must be awful and astonishing on this day march 30 1822 the winds have been acting upon the small lake of rydal as if they had received command to carry its waters from their bed into the sky the white billows in different quarters disappeared under clouds or rather drifts of spray that were whirled along and up into the air by scouring winds charging each other in squadrons in every direction upon the lake <\s>
<s> the spray having been hurried aloft till it lost its consistency and whiteness was driven along the mountain tops like flying showers that vanish in the distance <\s>
<s> frequently an eddying wind scooped the waters out of the basin and forced them upwards in the very shape of an icelandic geyser or boiling fountain to the height of several hundred feet <\s>
<s> this small mere of rydal from its position is subject in a peculiar degree to these commotions <\s>
<s> the present season however is unusually stormy great numbers of fish two of them not less than 12 pounds weight were a few days ago cast on the shores of derwent water by the force of the waves <\s>
<s> lest in the foregoing comparative estimate i should be suspected of partiality to my native mountains i will support my general opinion by the authority of mr <\s>
<s> west whose guide to the lakes has been eminently serviceable to the tourist for nearly 50 years <\s>
<s> the author a roman catholic clergyman had passed much time abroad and was well acquainted with the scenery of the continent <\s>

<s> the mountains here are all accessible to the summit and furnish prospects no less surprising and with more variety than the alps themselves <\s>
<s> for no traveller provided he be in good health and with any command of time would have a just privilege to visit such scenes if he could grudge the price of a little confinement among them or interruption in his journey for the sight or sound of a storm coming on or clearing away <\s>
<s> insensible must he be who would not congratulate himself upon the bold bursts of sunshine the descending vapours wandering lights and shadows and the invigorated torrents and waterfalls with which broken weather in a mountainous region is accompanied <\s>
<s> at such a time there is no cause to complain either of the monotony of midsummer colouring or the glaring atmosphere of long cloudless and hot days <\s>
<s> thus far concerning the respective advantages and disadvantages of the different seasons for visiting this country <\s>
<s> as to the order in which objects are best seen a lake being composed of water flowing from higher grounds and expanding itself till its receptacle is filled to the brim it follows that it will appear to most advantage when approached from its outlet especially if the lake be in a mountainous country for by this way of approach the traveller faces the grander features of the scene and is gradually conducted into its most sublime recesses <\s>
<s> now every one knows that from amenity and beauty the transition to sublimity is easy and favourable but the reverse is not so for after the faculties have been elevated they are indisposed to humbler excitement 62 62 the only instances to which the foregoing observations do not apply are derwent water and lowes water <\s>
<s> derwent is distinguished from all the other lakes by being surrounded with sublimity the fantastic mountains of borrowdale to the south the solitary majesty of skiddaw to the north the bold steeps of wallow crag and lodore to the east and to the west the clustering mountains of newlands <\s>

<s> i have witnessed many tremendous thunder storms among the alps and the most glorious effects of light and shadow but i never happened to be present when any lake was agitated by those hurricanes which i imagine must often torment them <\s>

<s> west whose guide to the lakes has been eminently serviceable to the tourist for nearly 50 years <\s>
<s> the author a roman catholic clergyman had passed much time abroad and was well acquainted with the scenery of the continent <\s>
<s> he thus expresses himself they who intend to make the continental tour should begin here as it will give in miniature an idea of what they are to meet with there in traversing the alps and appenines to which our northern mountains are not inferior in beauty of line or variety of summit number of lakes and transparency of water not in colouring of rock or softness of turf but in height and extent only <\s>
<s> the mountains here are all accessible to the summit and furnish prospects no less surprising and with more variety than the alps themselves <\s>
<s> for no traveller provided he be in good health and with any command of time would have a just privilege to visit such scenes if he could grudge the price of a little confinement among them or interruption in his journey for the sight or sound of a storm coming on or clearing away <\s>
<s> insensible must he be who would not congratulate himself upon the bold bursts of sunshine the descending vapours wandering lights and shadows and the invigorated torrents and waterfalls with which broken weather in a mountainous region is accompanied <\s>
<s> at such a time there is no cause to complain either of the monotony of midsummer colouring or the glaring atmosphere of long cloudless and hot days <\s>
<s> thus far concerning the respective advantages and disadvantages of the different seasons for visiting this country <\s>
<s> as to the order in which objects are best seen a lake being composed of water flowing from higher grounds and expanding itself till its receptacle is filled to the brim it follows that it will appear to most advantage when approached from its outlet especially if the lake be in a mountainous country for by this way of approach the traveller faces the grander features of the scene and is gradually conducted into its most sublime recesses <\s>
<s> now every one knows that from amenity and beauty the transition to sublimity is easy and favourable but the reverse is not so for after the faculties have been elevated they are indisposed to humbler excitement 62 62 the only instances to which the foregoing observations do not apply are derwent water and lowes water <\s>
<s> derwent is distinguished from all the other lakes by being surrounded with sublimity the fantastic mountains of borrowdale to the south the solitary majesty of skiddaw to the north the bold steeps of wallow crag and lodore to the east and to the west the clustering mountains of newlands <\s>
<s> lowes water is tame at the head but towards its outlet has a magnificent assemblage of mountains <\s>
<s> yet as far as respects the formation of such receptacles the general observation holds good neither derwent nor lowes water derive any supplies from the streams of those mountains that dignify the landscape towards the outlets <\s>
<s> it is not likely that a mountain will be ascended without disappointment if a wide range of prospect be the object unless either the summit be reached before sun rise or the visitant remain there until the time of sun set and afterwards <\s>
<s> the precipitous sides of the mountain and the neighbouring summits may be seen with effect under any atmosphere which allows them to be seen at all but he is the most fortunate adventurer who chances to be involved in vapours which open and let in an extent of country partially or dispersing suddenly reveal the whole region from centre to circumference <\s>
<s> a stranger to a mountainous country may not be aware that his walk in the early morning ought to be taken on the eastern side of the vale otherwise he will lose the morning light first touching the tops and thence creeping down the sides of the opposite hills as the sun ascends or he may go to some central eminence commanding both the shadows from the eastern and the lights upon the western mountains <\s>
<s> but if the horizon line in the east be low the western side may be taken for the sake of the reflections upon the water of light from the rising sun <\s>
<s> in the evening for like reasons the contrary course should be taken <\s>
<s> after all it is upon the mind which a traveller brings along with him that his acquisitions whether of pleasure or profit must principally depend may i be allowed a few words on this subject <\s>
<s> nothing is more injurious to genuine feeling than the practice of hastily and ungraciously depreciating the face of one country by comparing it with that of another <\s>
<s> true it is qui bene distinguit bene docet yet fastidiousness is a wretched travelling companion and the best guide to which in matters of taste we can entrust ourselves is a disposition to be pleased <\s>
<s> for example if a traveller be among the alps let him surrender up his mind to the fury of the gigantic torrents and take delight in the contemplation of their almost irresistible violence without complaining of the monotony of their foaming course or being disgusted with the muddiness of the water apparent even where it is violently agitated <\s>
<s> in cumberland and westmoreland let not the comparative weakness of the streams prevent him from sympathising with such impetuosity as they possess and making the most of the present objects let him as he justly may do observe with admiration the unrivalled brilliancy of the water and that variety of motion mood and character that arises out of the want of those resources by which the power of the streams in the alps is supported again with respect to the mountains though these are comparatively of diminutive size though there is little of perpetual snow and no voice of summer avalanches is heard among them and though traces left by the ravage of the elements are here comparatively rare and unimpressive yet out of this very deficiency proceeds a sense of stability and permanence that is to many minds more grateful while the hoarse rushes to the sweeping breeze sigh forth their ancient melodies <\s>
<s> among the alps are few places that do not preclude this feeling of tranquil sublimity <\s>
<s> havoc and ruin and desolation and encroachment are everywhere more or less obtruded and it is difficult notwithstanding the naked loftiness of the pikes and the snow capped summits of the mounts to escape from the depressing sensation that the whole are in a rapid process of dissolution and were it not that the destructive agency must abate as the heights diminish would in time to come be levelled with the plains <\s>
<s> nevertheless i would relish to the utmost the demonstrations of every species of power at work to effect such changes <\s>
<s> from these general views let us descend a moment to detail <\s>
<s> a stranger to mountain imagery naturally on his first arrival looks out for sublimity in every object that admits of it and is almost always disappointed <\s>
<s> for this disappointment there exists i believe no general preventive nor is it desirable that there should <\s>
<s> but with regard to one class of objects there is a point in which injurious expectations may be easily corrected <\s>
<s> it is generally supposed that waterfalls are scarcely worth being looked at except after much rain and that the more swoln the stream the more fortunate the spectator but this however is true only of large cataracts with sublime accompaniments and not even of these without some drawbacks <\s>
<s> in other instances what becomes at such a time of that sense of refreshing coolness which can only be felt in dry and sunny weather when the rocks herbs and flowers glisten with moisture diffused by the breath of the precipitous water <\s>
<s> but considering these things as objects of sight only it may be observed that the principal charm of the smaller waterfalls or cascades consists in certain proportions of form and affinities of colour among the component parts of the scene and in the contrast maintained between the falling water and that which is apparently at rest or rather settling gradually into quiet in the pool below <\s>
<s> the beauty of such a scene where there is naturally so much agitation is also heightened in a peculiar manner by the glimmering and towards the verge of the pool by the steady reflection of the surrounding images <\s>
<s> now all those delicate distinctions are destroyed by heavy floods and the whole stream rushes along in foam and tumultuous confusion <\s>
<s> a happy proportion of component parts is indeed noticeable among the landscapes of the north of england and in this characteristic essential to a perfect picture they surpass the scenes of scotland and in a still greater degree those of switzerland <\s>
<s> as a resident among the lakes i frequently hear the scenery of this country compared with that of the alps and therefore a few words shall be added to what has been incidentally said upon that subject <\s>
<s> if we could recall to this region of lakes the native pine forests with which many hundred years ago a large portion of the heights was covered then during spring and autumn it might frequently with much propriety be compared to switzerland the elements of the landscape would be the same one country representing the other in miniature <\s>
<s> towns villages churches rural seats bridges and roads green meadows and arable grounds with their various produce and deciduous woods of diversified foliage which occupy the vales and lower regions of the mountains would as in switzerland be divided by dark forests from ridges and round topped heights covered with snow and from pikes and sharp declivities imperfectly arrayed in the same glittering mantle and the resemblance would be still more perfect on those days when vapours resting upon and floating around the summits leave the elevation of the mountains less dependent upon the eye than on the imagination <\s>
<s> but the pine forests have wholly disappeared and only during late spring and early autumn is realised here that assemblage of the imagery of different seasons which is exhibited through the whole summer among the alps winter in the distance and warmth leafy woods verdure and fertility at hand and widely diffused <\s>
<s> striking then from among the permanent materials of the landscape that stage of vegetation which is occupied by pine forests and above that the perennial snows we have mountains the highest of which little exceed 3000 feet while some of the alps do not fall short of 14,000 or 15,000 and 8000 or 10,000 is not an uncommon elevation <\s>
<s> our tracts of wood and water are almost diminutive in comparison therefore as far as sublimity is dependent upon absolute bulk and height and atmospherical influences in connection with these it is obvious that there can be no rivalship <\s>
<s> but a short residence among the british mountains will furnish abundant proof that after a certain point of elevation viz <\s>
<s> that which allows of compact and fleecy clouds settling upon or sweeping over the summits the sense of sublimity depends more upon form and relation of objects to each other than upon their actual magnitude and that an elevation of 3000 feet is sufficient to call forth in a most impressive degree the creative and magnifying and softening powers of the atmosphere <\s>
<s> hence on the score even of sublimity the superiority of the alps is by no means so great as might hastily be inferred and as to the beauty of the lower regions of the swiss mountains it is noticeable that as they are all regularly mown their surface has nothing of that mellow tone and variety of hues by which mountain turf that is never touched by the scythe is distinguished <\s>
<s> on the smooth and steep slopes of the swiss hills these plots of verdure do indeed agreeably unite their colour with that of the deciduous trees or make a lively contrast with the dark green pine groves that define them and among which they run in endless variety of shapes but this is most pleasing at first sight the permanent gratification of the eye requires finer gradations of tone and a more delicate blending of hues into each other <\s>
<s> besides it is only in spring and late autumn that cattle animate by their presence the swiss lawns and though the pastures of the higher regions where they feed during the summer are left in their natural state of flowery herbage those pastures are so remote that their texture and colour are of no consequence in the composition of any picture in which a lake of the vales is a feature <\s>
<s> yet in those lofty regions how vegetation is invigorated by the genial climate of that country <\s>
<s> among the luxuriant flowers there met with groves or forests if i may so call them of monks hood are frequently seen the plant of deep rich blue and as tall as in our gardens and this at an elevation where in cumberland icelandic moss would only be found or the stony summits be utterly bare <\s>
<s> we have then for the colouring of switzerland principally a vivid green herbage black woods and dazzling snows presented in masses with a grandeur to which no one can be insensible but not often graduated by nature into soothing harmony and so ill suited to the pencil that though abundance of good subjects may be there found they are not such as can be deemed characteristic of the country nor is this unfitness confined to colour the forms of the mountains though many of them in some points of view the noblest that can be conceived are apt to run into spikes and needles and present a jagged outline which has a mean effect transferred to canvass <\s>
<s> this must have been felt by the ancient masters for if i am not mistaken they have not left a single landscape the materials of which are taken from the peculiar features of the alps yet titian passed his life almost in their neighbourhood the poussins and claude must have been well acquainted with their aspects and several admirable painters as tibaldi and luino were born among the italian alps <\s>
<s> a few experiments have lately been made by englishmen but they only prove that courage skill and judgment may surmount any obstacles and it may be safely affirmed that they who have done best in this bold adventure will be the least likely to repeat the attempt <\s>
<s> but though our scenes are better suited to painting than those of the alps i should be sorry to contemplate either country in reference to that art further than as its fitness or unfitness for the pencil renders it more or less pleasing to the eye of the spectator who has learned to observe and feel chiefly from nature herself <\s>
<s> deeming the points in which alpine imagery is superior to british too obvious to be insisted upon i will observe that the deciduous woods though in many places unapproachable by the axe and triumphing in the pomp and prodigality of nature have in general 63 neither the variety nor beauty which would exist in those of the mountains of britain if left to themselves <\s>
<s> magnificent walnut trees grow upon the plains of switzerland and fine trees of that species are found scattered over the hill sides birches also grow here and there in luxuriant beauty but neither these nor oaks are ever a prevailing tree nor can even be said to be common and the oaks as far as i had an opportunity of observing are greatly inferior to those of britain <\s>

<s> on the italian side of the alps chesnut and walnut trees grow at a considerable height on the mountains but even there the foliage is not equal in beauty to the natural product of this climate <\s>

<s> in cumberland and westmoreland let not the comparative weakness of the streams prevent him from sympathising with such impetuosity as they possess and making the most of the present objects let him as he justly may do observe with admiration the unrivalled brilliancy of the water and that variety of motion mood and character that arises out of the want of those resources by which the power of the streams in the alps is supported again with respect to the mountains though these are comparatively of diminutive size though there is little of perpetual snow and no voice of summer avalanches is heard among them and though traces left by the ravage of the elements are here comparatively rare and unimpressive yet out of this very deficiency proceeds a sense of stability and permanence that is to many minds more grateful while the hoarse rushes to the sweeping breeze sigh forth their ancient melodies <\s>
<s> among the alps are few places that do not preclude this feeling of tranquil sublimity <\s>

<s> nevertheless i would relish to the utmost the demonstrations of every species of power at work to effect such changes <\s>
<s> from these general views let us descend a moment to detail <\s>
<s> a stranger to mountain imagery naturally on his first arrival looks out for sublimity in every object that admits of it and is almost always disappointed <\s>
<s> for this disappointment there exists i believe no general preventive nor is it desirable that there should <\s>
<s> but with regard to one class of objects there is a point in which injurious expectations may be easily corrected <\s>
<s> it is generally supposed that waterfalls are scarcely worth being looked at except after much rain and that the more swoln the stream the more fortunate the spectator but this however is true only of large cataracts with sublime accompaniments and not even of these without some drawbacks <\s>
<s> in other instances what becomes at such a time of that sense of refreshing coolness which can only be felt in dry and sunny weather when the rocks herbs and flowers glisten with moisture diffused by the breath of the precipitous water <\s>
<s> but considering these things as objects of sight only it may be observed that the principal charm of the smaller waterfalls or cascades consists in certain proportions of form and affinities of colour among the component parts of the scene and in the contrast maintained between the falling water and that which is apparently at rest or rather settling gradually into quiet in the pool below <\s>
<s> the beauty of such a scene where there is naturally so much agitation is also heightened in a peculiar manner by the glimmering and towards the verge of the pool by the steady reflection of the surrounding images <\s>
<s> now all those delicate distinctions are destroyed by heavy floods and the whole stream rushes along in foam and tumultuous confusion <\s>
<s> a happy proportion of component parts is indeed noticeable among the landscapes of the north of england and in this characteristic essential to a perfect picture they surpass the scenes of scotland and in a still greater degree those of switzerland <\s>
<s> as a resident among the lakes i frequently hear the scenery of this country compared with that of the alps and therefore a few words shall be added to what has been incidentally said upon that subject <\s>
<s> if we could recall to this region of lakes the native pine forests with which many hundred years ago a large portion of the heights was covered then during spring and autumn it might frequently with much propriety be compared to switzerland the elements of the landscape would be the same one country representing the other in miniature <\s>
<s> towns villages churches rural seats bridges and roads green meadows and arable grounds with their various produce and deciduous woods of diversified foliage which occupy the vales and lower regions of the mountains would as in switzerland be divided by dark forests from ridges and round topped heights covered with snow and from pikes and sharp declivities imperfectly arrayed in the same glittering mantle and the resemblance would be still more perfect on those days when vapours resting upon and floating around the summits leave the elevation of the mountains less dependent upon the eye than on the imagination <\s>
<s> but the pine forests have wholly disappeared and only during late spring and early autumn is realised here that assemblage of the imagery of different seasons which is exhibited through the whole summer among the alps winter in the distance and warmth leafy woods verdure and fertility at hand and widely diffused <\s>
<s> striking then from among the permanent materials of the landscape that stage of vegetation which is occupied by pine forests and above that the perennial snows we have mountains the highest of which little exceed 3000 feet while some of the alps do not fall short of 14,000 or 15,000 and 8000 or 10,000 is not an uncommon elevation <\s>
<s> our tracts of wood and water are almost diminutive in comparison therefore as far as sublimity is dependent upon absolute bulk and height and atmospherical influences in connection with these it is obvious that there can be no rivalship <\s>
<s> but a short residence among the british mountains will furnish abundant proof that after a certain point of elevation viz <\s>
<s> that which allows of compact and fleecy clouds settling upon or sweeping over the summits the sense of sublimity depends more upon form and relation of objects to each other than upon their actual magnitude and that an elevation of 3000 feet is sufficient to call forth in a most impressive degree the creative and magnifying and softening powers of the atmosphere <\s>
<s> hence on the score even of sublimity the superiority of the alps is by no means so great as might hastily be inferred and as to the beauty of the lower regions of the swiss mountains it is noticeable that as they are all regularly mown their surface has nothing of that mellow tone and variety of hues by which mountain turf that is never touched by the scythe is distinguished <\s>
<s> on the smooth and steep slopes of the swiss hills these plots of verdure do indeed agreeably unite their colour with that of the deciduous trees or make a lively contrast with the dark green pine groves that define them and among which they run in endless variety of shapes but this is most pleasing at first sight the permanent gratification of the eye requires finer gradations of tone and a more delicate blending of hues into each other <\s>
<s> besides it is only in spring and late autumn that cattle animate by their presence the swiss lawns and though the pastures of the higher regions where they feed during the summer are left in their natural state of flowery herbage those pastures are so remote that their texture and colour are of no consequence in the composition of any picture in which a lake of the vales is a feature <\s>
<s> yet in those lofty regions how vegetation is invigorated by the genial climate of that country <\s>
<s> among the luxuriant flowers there met with groves or forests if i may so call them of monks hood are frequently seen the plant of deep rich blue and as tall as in our gardens and this at an elevation where in cumberland icelandic moss would only be found or the stony summits be utterly bare <\s>
<s> we have then for the colouring of switzerland principally a vivid green herbage black woods and dazzling snows presented in masses with a grandeur to which no one can be insensible but not often graduated by nature into soothing harmony and so ill suited to the pencil that though abundance of good subjects may be there found they are not such as can be deemed characteristic of the country nor is this unfitness confined to colour the forms of the mountains though many of them in some points of view the noblest that can be conceived are apt to run into spikes and needles and present a jagged outline which has a mean effect transferred to canvass <\s>
<s> this must have been felt by the ancient masters for if i am not mistaken they have not left a single landscape the materials of which are taken from the peculiar features of the alps yet titian passed his life almost in their neighbourhood the poussins and claude must have been well acquainted with their aspects and several admirable painters as tibaldi and luino were born among the italian alps <\s>
<s> a few experiments have lately been made by englishmen but they only prove that courage skill and judgment may surmount any obstacles and it may be safely affirmed that they who have done best in this bold adventure will be the least likely to repeat the attempt <\s>
<s> but though our scenes are better suited to painting than those of the alps i should be sorry to contemplate either country in reference to that art further than as its fitness or unfitness for the pencil renders it more or less pleasing to the eye of the spectator who has learned to observe and feel chiefly from nature herself <\s>
<s> deeming the points in which alpine imagery is superior to british too obvious to be insisted upon i will observe that the deciduous woods though in many places unapproachable by the axe and triumphing in the pomp and prodigality of nature have in general 63 neither the variety nor beauty which would exist in those of the mountains of britain if left to themselves <\s>
<s> magnificent walnut trees grow upon the plains of switzerland and fine trees of that species are found scattered over the hill sides birches also grow here and there in luxuriant beauty but neither these nor oaks are ever a prevailing tree nor can even be said to be common and the oaks as far as i had an opportunity of observing are greatly inferior to those of britain <\s>
<s> among the interior vallies the proportion of beeches and pines is so great that other trees are scarcely noticeable and surely such woods are at all seasons much less agreeable than that rich and harmonious distribution of oak ash elm birch and alder that formerly clothed the sides of snowdon and helvellyn and of which no mean remains still survive at the head of ulswater <\s>
<s> on the italian side of the alps chesnut and walnut trees grow at a considerable height on the mountains but even there the foliage is not equal in beauty to the natural product of this climate <\s>
<s> in fact the sunshine of the south of europe so envied when heard of at a distance is in many respects injurious to rural beauty particularly as it incites to the cultivation of spots of ground which in colder climates would be left in the hands of nature favouring at the same time the culture of plants that are more valuable on account of the fruit they produce to gratify the palate than for affording pleasure to the eye as materials of landscape <\s>
<s> take for instance the promontory of bellagio so fortunate in its command of the three branches of the lake of como yet the ridge of the promontory itself being for the most part covered with vines interspersed with olive trees accords but ill with the vastness of the green unappropriated mountains and derogates not a little from the sublimity of those finely contrasted pictures to which it is a foreground <\s>
<s> the vine when cultivated upon a large scale notwithstanding all that may be said of it in poetry 64 makes but a dull formal appearance in landscape and the olive tree though one is loth to say so is not more grateful to the eye than our common willow which it much resembles but the hoariness of hue common to both has in the aquatic plant an appropriate delicacy harmonising with the situation in which it most delights <\s>
<s> the same may no doubt be said of the olive among the dry rocks of attica but i am speaking of it as found in gardens and vineyards in the north of italy <\s>
<s> at bellagio what englishman can resist the temptation of substituting in his fancy for these formal treasures of cultivation the natural variety of one of our parks its pastured lawns coverts of hawthorn of wild rose and honeysuckle and the majesty of forest trees such wild graces as the banks of derwent water shewed in the time of the ratcliffes and growbarrow park lowther and rydal do at this day <\s>
<s> 63 the greatest variety of trees is found in the valais <\s>
<s> as my object is to reconcile a briton to the scenery of his own country though not at the expense of truth i am not afraid of asserting that in many points of view our lakes also are much more interesting than those of the alps first as is implied above from being more happily proportioned to the other features of the landscape and next both as being infinitely more pellucid and less subject to agitation from the winds 65 64 lucretius has charmingly described a scene of this kind <\s>
<s> inque dies magis in montem succedere sylvas cogebant infráquo locum coucedere cultis prata lacus rivos segetes vinetaque laeta collibus et campis ut haberent atque olearum caerula distinguens inter plaga currere posset per tumulos et convalleis camposque profusa ut nunc esse vides vario distincta lepore onmia quae pomis intersita dulcibus ornant arbustisque teneut felicibus obsita circúm <\s>
<s> 65 it is remarkable that como as is probably the case with other italian lakes is more troubled by storms in summer than in winter <\s>
<s> hence the propriety of the following verses lari <\s>
<s> margine ubique confragoso nulli coelicolum negas sacellum picto pariete saxeoque tecto hinc miracula multa navitarum audis nee placido refellis ore sed nova usque pavas noto vel euro aestivas quatieutibus cavernas vel surgentis ab adduae cubili caeco grandinis imbre provoluto <\s>
<s> como which may perhaps be styled the king of lakes as lugano is certainly the queen is disturbed by a periodical wind blowing from the head in the morning and towards it in the afternoon <\s>
<s> the magnificent lake of the four cantons especially its noblest division called the lake of uri is not only much agitated by winds but in the night time is disturbed from the bottom as i was told and indeed as i witnessed without any apparent commotion in the air and when at rest the water is not pure to the eye but of a heavy green hue as is that of all the other lakes apparently according to the degree in which they are fed by melted snows <\s>
<s> if the lake of geneva furnish an exception this is probably owing to its vast extent which allows the water to deposit its impurities <\s>
<s> the water of the english lakes on the contrary being of a crystalline clearness the reflections of the surrounding hills are frequently so lively that it is scarcely possible to distinguish the point where the real object terminates and its unsubstantial duplicate begins <\s>
<s> the lower part of the lake of geneva from its narrowness must be much less subject to agitation than the higher divisions and as the water is clearer than that of the other swiss lakes it will frequently exhibit this appearance though it is scarcely possible in an equal degree <\s>
<s> during two comprehensive tours among the alps i did not observe except on one of the smaller lakes between lugano and ponte tresa a single instance of those beautiful repetitions of surrounding objects on the bosom of the water which are so frequently seen here not to speak of the fine dazzling trembling net work breezy motions and streaks and circles of intermingled smooth and rippled water which make the surface of our lakes a field of endless variety <\s>
<s> but among the alps where every thing tends to the grand and the sublime in surfaces as well as in forms if the lakes do not court the placid reflections of land objects those of first rate magnitude make compensation in some degree by exhibiting those ever changing fields of green blue and purple shadows or lights one scarcely knows which to name them that call to mind a sea prospect contemplated from a lofty cliff <\s>
<s> the subject of torrents and waterfalls has already been touched upon but it may be added that in switzerland the perpetual accompaniment of snow upon the higher regions takes much from the effect of foaming white streams while from their frequency they obstruct each other's influence upon the mind of the spectator and in all cases the effect of an individual cataract excepting the great fall of the rhine at schaffhausen is diminished by the general fury of the stream of which it is a part <\s>
<s> recurring to the reflections from still water i will describe a singular phenomenon of this kind of which i was an eye witness <\s>
<s> walking by the side of ulswater upon a calm september morning i saw deep within the bosom of the lake a magnificent castle with towers and battlements nothing could be more distinct than the whole edifice <\s>
<s> after gazing with delight upon it for some time as upon a work of enchantment i could not but regret that my previous knowledge of the place enabled me to account for the appearance <\s>
<s> it was in fact the reflection of a pleasure house called lyulph's tower the towers and battlements magnified and so much changed in shape as not to be immediately recognised <\s>
<s> in the meanwhile the pleasure house itself was altogether hidden from my view by a body of vapour stretching over it and along the hill side on which it stands but not so as to have intercepted its communication with the lake and hence this novel and most impressive object which if i had been a stranger to the spot would from its being inexplicable have long detained the mind in a state of pleasing astonishment <\s>
<s> appearances of this kind acting upon the credulity of early ages may have given birth to and favoured the belief in stories of sub aqueous palaces gardens and pleasure grounds the brilliant ornaments of romance <\s>
<s> with this inverted scene i will couple a much more extraordinary phenomenon which will show how other elegant fancies may have had their origin less in invention than in the actual processes of nature <\s>
<s> about eleven o'clock on the forenoon of a winter's day coming suddenly in company of a friend into view of the lake of grasmere we were alarmed by the sight of a newly created island the transitory thought of the moment was that it had been produced by an earthquake or some other convulsion of nature <\s>
<s> recovering from the alarm which was greater than the reader can possibly sympathise with but which was shared to its full extent by my companion we proceeded to examine the object before us <\s>
<s> the elevation of this new island exceeded considerably that of the old one its neighbour it was likewise larger in circumference comprehending a space of about five acres its surface rocky speckled with snow and sprinkled over with birch trees it was divided towards the south from the other island by a narrow frith and in like manner from the northern shore of the lake on the east and west it was separated from the shore by a much larger space of smooth water <\s>
<s> marvellous was the illusion <\s>
<s> comparing the new with the old island the surface of which is soft green and unvaried i do not scruple to say that as an object of sight it was much the more distinct <\s>
<s> how little faith we exclaimed is due to one sense unless its evidence be confirmed by some of its fellows <\s>
<s> what stranger could possibly be persuaded that this which we know to be an unsubstantial mockery is really so and that there exists only a single island on this beautiful lake <\s>
<s> at length the appearance underwent a gradual transmutation it lost its prominence and passed into a glimmering and dim inversion and then totally disappeared leaving behind it a clear open area of ice of the same dimensions <\s>
<s> we now perceived that this bed of ice which was thinly suffused with water had produced the illusion by reflecting and refracting as persons skilled in optics would no doubt easily explain a rocky and woody section of the opposite mountain named silver how <\s>

<s> if the lake of geneva furnish an exception this is probably owing to its vast extent which allows the water to deposit its impurities <\s>

<s> the lower part of the lake of geneva from its narrowness must be much less subject to agitation than the higher divisions and as the water is clearer than that of the other swiss lakes it will frequently exhibit this appearance though it is scarcely possible in an equal degree <\s>
<s> during two comprehensive tours among the alps i did not observe except on one of the smaller lakes between lugano and ponte tresa a single instance of those beautiful repetitions of surrounding objects on the bosom of the water which are so frequently seen here not to speak of the fine dazzling trembling net work breezy motions and streaks and circles of intermingled smooth and rippled water which make the surface of our lakes a field of endless variety <\s>
<s> but among the alps where every thing tends to the grand and the sublime in surfaces as well as in forms if the lakes do not court the placid reflections of land objects those of first rate magnitude make compensation in some degree by exhibiting those ever changing fields of green blue and purple shadows or lights one scarcely knows which to name them that call to mind a sea prospect contemplated from a lofty cliff <\s>
<s> the subject of torrents and waterfalls has already been touched upon but it may be added that in switzerland the perpetual accompaniment of snow upon the higher regions takes much from the effect of foaming white streams while from their frequency they obstruct each other's influence upon the mind of the spectator and in all cases the effect of an individual cataract excepting the great fall of the rhine at schaffhausen is diminished by the general fury of the stream of which it is a part <\s>
<s> recurring to the reflections from still water i will describe a singular phenomenon of this kind of which i was an eye witness <\s>
<s> walking by the side of ulswater upon a calm september morning i saw deep within the bosom of the lake a magnificent castle with towers and battlements nothing could be more distinct than the whole edifice <\s>
<s> after gazing with delight upon it for some time as upon a work of enchantment i could not but regret that my previous knowledge of the place enabled me to account for the appearance <\s>
<s> it was in fact the reflection of a pleasure house called lyulph's tower the towers and battlements magnified and so much changed in shape as not to be immediately recognised <\s>
<s> in the meanwhile the pleasure house itself was altogether hidden from my view by a body of vapour stretching over it and along the hill side on which it stands but not so as to have intercepted its communication with the lake and hence this novel and most impressive object which if i had been a stranger to the spot would from its being inexplicable have long detained the mind in a state of pleasing astonishment <\s>
<s> appearances of this kind acting upon the credulity of early ages may have given birth to and favoured the belief in stories of sub aqueous palaces gardens and pleasure grounds the brilliant ornaments of romance <\s>
<s> with this inverted scene i will couple a much more extraordinary phenomenon which will show how other elegant fancies may have had their origin less in invention than in the actual processes of nature <\s>
<s> about eleven o'clock on the forenoon of a winter's day coming suddenly in company of a friend into view of the lake of grasmere we were alarmed by the sight of a newly created island the transitory thought of the moment was that it had been produced by an earthquake or some other convulsion of nature <\s>
<s> recovering from the alarm which was greater than the reader can possibly sympathise with but which was shared to its full extent by my companion we proceeded to examine the object before us <\s>
<s> the elevation of this new island exceeded considerably that of the old one its neighbour it was likewise larger in circumference comprehending a space of about five acres its surface rocky speckled with snow and sprinkled over with birch trees it was divided towards the south from the other island by a narrow frith and in like manner from the northern shore of the lake on the east and west it was separated from the shore by a much larger space of smooth water <\s>
<s> marvellous was the illusion <\s>
<s> comparing the new with the old island the surface of which is soft green and unvaried i do not scruple to say that as an object of sight it was much the more distinct <\s>
<s> how little faith we exclaimed is due to one sense unless its evidence be confirmed by some of its fellows <\s>
<s> what stranger could possibly be persuaded that this which we know to be an unsubstantial mockery is really so and that there exists only a single island on this beautiful lake <\s>
<s> at length the appearance underwent a gradual transmutation it lost its prominence and passed into a glimmering and dim inversion and then totally disappeared leaving behind it a clear open area of ice of the same dimensions <\s>
<s> we now perceived that this bed of ice which was thinly suffused with water had produced the illusion by reflecting and refracting as persons skilled in optics would no doubt easily explain a rocky and woody section of the opposite mountain named silver how <\s>
<s> having dwelt so much upon the beauty of pure and still water and pointed out the advantage which the lakes of the north of england have in this particular over those of the alps it would be injustice not to advert to the sublimity that must often be given to alpine scenes by the agitations to which those vast bodies of diffused water are there subject <\s>
<s> i have witnessed many tremendous thunder storms among the alps and the most glorious effects of light and shadow but i never happened to be present when any lake was agitated by those hurricanes which i imagine must often torment them <\s>
<s> if the commotions be at all proportionable to the expanse and depth of the waters and the height of the surrounding mountains then if i may judge from what is frequently seen here the exhibition must be awful and astonishing on this day march 30 1822 the winds have been acting upon the small lake of rydal as if they had received command to carry its waters from their bed into the sky the white billows in different quarters disappeared under clouds or rather drifts of spray that were whirled along and up into the air by scouring winds charging each other in squadrons in every direction upon the lake <\s>
<s> the spray having been hurried aloft till it lost its consistency and whiteness was driven along the mountain tops like flying showers that vanish in the distance <\s>
<s> frequently an eddying wind scooped the waters out of the basin and forced them upwards in the very shape of an icelandic geyser or boiling fountain to the height of several hundred feet <\s>
<s> this small mere of rydal from its position is subject in a peculiar degree to these commotions <\s>
<s> the present season however is unusually stormy great numbers of fish two of them not less than 12 pounds weight were a few days ago cast on the shores of derwent water by the force of the waves <\s>
<s> lest in the foregoing comparative estimate i should be suspected of partiality to my native mountains i will support my general opinion by the authority of mr <\s>
<s> west whose guide to the lakes has been eminently serviceable to the tourist for nearly 50 years <\s>
<s> the author a roman catholic clergyman had passed much time abroad and was well acquainted with the scenery of the continent <\s>
<s> he thus expresses himself they who intend to make the continental tour should begin here as it will give in miniature an idea of what they are to meet with there in traversing the alps and appenines to which our northern mountains are not inferior in beauty of line or variety of summit number of lakes and transparency of water not in colouring of rock or softness of turf but in height and extent only <\s>
<s> the mountains here are all accessible to the summit and furnish prospects no less surprising and with more variety than the alps themselves <\s>
<s> for no traveller provided he be in good health and with any command of time would have a just privilege to visit such scenes if he could grudge the price of a little confinement among them or interruption in his journey for the sight or sound of a storm coming on or clearing away <\s>
<s> insensible must he be who would not congratulate himself upon the bold bursts of sunshine the descending vapours wandering lights and shadows and the invigorated torrents and waterfalls with which broken weather in a mountainous region is accompanied <\s>
<s> at such a time there is no cause to complain either of the monotony of midsummer colouring or the glaring atmosphere of long cloudless and hot days <\s>
<s> thus far concerning the respective advantages and disadvantages of the different seasons for visiting this country <\s>
<s> as to the order in which objects are best seen a lake being composed of water flowing from higher grounds and expanding itself till its receptacle is filled to the brim it follows that it will appear to most advantage when approached from its outlet especially if the lake be in a mountainous country for by this way of approach the traveller faces the grander features of the scene and is gradually conducted into its most sublime recesses <\s>
<s> now every one knows that from amenity and beauty the transition to sublimity is easy and favourable but the reverse is not so for after the faculties have been elevated they are indisposed to humbler excitement 62 62 the only instances to which the foregoing observations do not apply are derwent water and lowes water <\s>
<s> derwent is distinguished from all the other lakes by being surrounded with sublimity the fantastic mountains of borrowdale to the south the solitary majesty of skiddaw to the north the bold steeps of wallow crag and lodore to the east and to the west the clustering mountains of newlands <\s>
<s> lowes water is tame at the head but towards its outlet has a magnificent assemblage of mountains <\s>
<s> yet as far as respects the formation of such receptacles the general observation holds good neither derwent nor lowes water derive any supplies from the streams of those mountains that dignify the landscape towards the outlets <\s>
<s> it is not likely that a mountain will be ascended without disappointment if a wide range of prospect be the object unless either the summit be reached before sun rise or the visitant remain there until the time of sun set and afterwards <\s>
<s> the precipitous sides of the mountain and the neighbouring summits may be seen with effect under any atmosphere which allows them to be seen at all but he is the most fortunate adventurer who chances to be involved in vapours which open and let in an extent of country partially or dispersing suddenly reveal the whole region from centre to circumference <\s>
<s> a stranger to a mountainous country may not be aware that his walk in the early morning ought to be taken on the eastern side of the vale otherwise he will lose the morning light first touching the tops and thence creeping down the sides of the opposite hills as the sun ascends or he may go to some central eminence commanding both the shadows from the eastern and the lights upon the western mountains <\s>
<s> but if the horizon line in the east be low the western side may be taken for the sake of the reflections upon the water of light from the rising sun <\s>
<s> in the evening for like reasons the contrary course should be taken <\s>
<s> after all it is upon the mind which a traveller brings along with him that his acquisitions whether of pleasure or profit must principally depend may i be allowed a few words on this subject <\s>
<s> nothing is more injurious to genuine feeling than the practice of hastily and ungraciously depreciating the face of one country by comparing it with that of another <\s>
<s> true it is qui bene distinguit bene docet yet fastidiousness is a wretched travelling companion and the best guide to which in matters of taste we can entrust ourselves is a disposition to be pleased <\s>
<s> for example if a traveller be among the alps let him surrender up his mind to the fury of the gigantic torrents and take delight in the contemplation of their almost irresistible violence without complaining of the monotony of their foaming course or being disgusted with the muddiness of the water apparent even where it is violently agitated <\s>
<s> in cumberland and westmoreland let not the comparative weakness of the streams prevent him from sympathising with such impetuosity as they possess and making the most of the present objects let him as he justly may do observe with admiration the unrivalled brilliancy of the water and that variety of motion mood and character that arises out of the want of those resources by which the power of the streams in the alps is supported again with respect to the mountains though these are comparatively of diminutive size though there is little of perpetual snow and no voice of summer avalanches is heard among them and though traces left by the ravage of the elements are here comparatively rare and unimpressive yet out of this very deficiency proceeds a sense of stability and permanence that is to many minds more grateful while the hoarse rushes to the sweeping breeze sigh forth their ancient melodies <\s>
<s> among the alps are few places that do not preclude this feeling of tranquil sublimity <\s>
<s> havoc and ruin and desolation and encroachment are everywhere more or less obtruded and it is difficult notwithstanding the naked loftiness of the pikes and the snow capped summits of the mounts to escape from the depressing sensation that the whole are in a rapid process of dissolution and were it not that the destructive agency must abate as the heights diminish would in time to come be levelled with the plains <\s>
<s> nevertheless i would relish to the utmost the demonstrations of every species of power at work to effect such changes <\s>
<s> from these general views let us descend a moment to detail <\s>
<s> a stranger to mountain imagery naturally on his first arrival looks out for sublimity in every object that admits of it and is almost always disappointed <\s>
<s> for this disappointment there exists i believe no general preventive nor is it desirable that there should <\s>
<s> but with regard to one class of objects there is a point in which injurious expectations may be easily corrected <\s>
<s> it is generally supposed that waterfalls are scarcely worth being looked at except after much rain and that the more swoln the stream the more fortunate the spectator but this however is true only of large cataracts with sublime accompaniments and not even of these without some drawbacks <\s>
<s> in other instances what becomes at such a time of that sense of refreshing coolness which can only be felt in dry and sunny weather when the rocks herbs and flowers glisten with moisture diffused by the breath of the precipitous water <\s>
<s> but considering these things as objects of sight only it may be observed that the principal charm of the smaller waterfalls or cascades consists in certain proportions of form and affinities of colour among the component parts of the scene and in the contrast maintained between the falling water and that which is apparently at rest or rather settling gradually into quiet in the pool below <\s>
<s> the beauty of such a scene where there is naturally so much agitation is also heightened in a peculiar manner by the glimmering and towards the verge of the pool by the steady reflection of the surrounding images <\s>
<s> now all those delicate distinctions are destroyed by heavy floods and the whole stream rushes along in foam and tumultuous confusion <\s>
<s> a happy proportion of component parts is indeed noticeable among the landscapes of the north of england and in this characteristic essential to a perfect picture they surpass the scenes of scotland and in a still greater degree those of switzerland <\s>
<s> as a resident among the lakes i frequently hear the scenery of this country compared with that of the alps and therefore a few words shall be added to what has been incidentally said upon that subject <\s>
<s> if we could recall to this region of lakes the native pine forests with which many hundred years ago a large portion of the heights was covered then during spring and autumn it might frequently with much propriety be compared to switzerland the elements of the landscape would be the same one country representing the other in miniature <\s>

<s> a stranger to a mountainous country may not be aware that his walk in the early morning ought to be taken on the eastern side of the vale otherwise he will lose the morning light first touching the tops and thence creeping down the sides of the opposite hills as the sun ascends or he may go to some central eminence commanding both the shadows from the eastern and the lights upon the western mountains <\s>

<s> nothing is more injurious to genuine feeling than the practice of hastily and ungraciously depreciating the face of one country by comparing it with that of another <\s>
<s> true it is qui bene distinguit bene docet yet fastidiousness is a wretched travelling companion and the best guide to which in matters of taste we can entrust ourselves is a disposition to be pleased <\s>
<s> for example if a traveller be among the alps let him surrender up his mind to the fury of the gigantic torrents and take delight in the contemplation of their almost irresistible violence without complaining of the monotony of their foaming course or being disgusted with the muddiness of the water apparent even where it is violently agitated <\s>
<s> in cumberland and westmoreland let not the comparative weakness of the streams prevent him from sympathising with such impetuosity as they possess and making the most of the present objects let him as he justly may do observe with admiration the unrivalled brilliancy of the water and that variety of motion mood and character that arises out of the want of those resources by which the power of the streams in the alps is supported again with respect to the mountains though these are comparatively of diminutive size though there is little of perpetual snow and no voice of summer avalanches is heard among them and though traces left by the ravage of the elements are here comparatively rare and unimpressive yet out of this very deficiency proceeds a sense of stability and permanence that is to many minds more grateful while the hoarse rushes to the sweeping breeze sigh forth their ancient melodies <\s>
<s> among the alps are few places that do not preclude this feeling of tranquil sublimity <\s>
<s> havoc and ruin and desolation and encroachment are everywhere more or less obtruded and it is difficult notwithstanding the naked loftiness of the pikes and the snow capped summits of the mounts to escape from the depressing sensation that the whole are in a rapid process of dissolution and were it not that the destructive agency must abate as the heights diminish would in time to come be levelled with the plains <\s>
<s> nevertheless i would relish to the utmost the demonstrations of every species of power at work to effect such changes <\s>
<s> from these general views let us descend a moment to detail <\s>
<s> a stranger to mountain imagery naturally on his first arrival looks out for sublimity in every object that admits of it and is almost always disappointed <\s>
<s> for this disappointment there exists i believe no general preventive nor is it desirable that there should <\s>
<s> but with regard to one class of objects there is a point in which injurious expectations may be easily corrected <\s>
<s> it is generally supposed that waterfalls are scarcely worth being looked at except after much rain and that the more swoln the stream the more fortunate the spectator but this however is true only of large cataracts with sublime accompaniments and not even of these without some drawbacks <\s>
<s> in other instances what becomes at such a time of that sense of refreshing coolness which can only be felt in dry and sunny weather when the rocks herbs and flowers glisten with moisture diffused by the breath of the precipitous water <\s>
<s> but considering these things as objects of sight only it may be observed that the principal charm of the smaller waterfalls or cascades consists in certain proportions of form and affinities of colour among the component parts of the scene and in the contrast maintained between the falling water and that which is apparently at rest or rather settling gradually into quiet in the pool below <\s>
<s> the beauty of such a scene where there is naturally so much agitation is also heightened in a peculiar manner by the glimmering and towards the verge of the pool by the steady reflection of the surrounding images <\s>
<s> now all those delicate distinctions are destroyed by heavy floods and the whole stream rushes along in foam and tumultuous confusion <\s>
<s> a happy proportion of component parts is indeed noticeable among the landscapes of the north of england and in this characteristic essential to a perfect picture they surpass the scenes of scotland and in a still greater degree those of switzerland <\s>
<s> as a resident among the lakes i frequently hear the scenery of this country compared with that of the alps and therefore a few words shall be added to what has been incidentally said upon that subject <\s>
<s> if we could recall to this region of lakes the native pine forests with which many hundred years ago a large portion of the heights was covered then during spring and autumn it might frequently with much propriety be compared to switzerland the elements of the landscape would be the same one country representing the other in miniature <\s>
<s> towns villages churches rural seats bridges and roads green meadows and arable grounds with their various produce and deciduous woods of diversified foliage which occupy the vales and lower regions of the mountains would as in switzerland be divided by dark forests from ridges and round topped heights covered with snow and from pikes and sharp declivities imperfectly arrayed in the same glittering mantle and the resemblance would be still more perfect on those days when vapours resting upon and floating around the summits leave the elevation of the mountains less dependent upon the eye than on the imagination <\s>
<s> but the pine forests have wholly disappeared and only during late spring and early autumn is realised here that assemblage of the imagery of different seasons which is exhibited through the whole summer among the alps winter in the distance and warmth leafy woods verdure and fertility at hand and widely diffused <\s>
<s> striking then from among the permanent materials of the landscape that stage of vegetation which is occupied by pine forests and above that the perennial snows we have mountains the highest of which little exceed 3000 feet while some of the alps do not fall short of 14,000 or 15,000 and 8000 or 10,000 is not an uncommon elevation <\s>
<s> our tracts of wood and water are almost diminutive in comparison therefore as far as sublimity is dependent upon absolute bulk and height and atmospherical influences in connection with these it is obvious that there can be no rivalship <\s>
<s> but a short residence among the british mountains will furnish abundant proof that after a certain point of elevation viz <\s>
<s> that which allows of compact and fleecy clouds settling upon or sweeping over the summits the sense of sublimity depends more upon form and relation of objects to each other than upon their actual magnitude and that an elevation of 3000 feet is sufficient to call forth in a most impressive degree the creative and magnifying and softening powers of the atmosphere <\s>
<s> hence on the score even of sublimity the superiority of the alps is by no means so great as might hastily be inferred and as to the beauty of the lower regions of the swiss mountains it is noticeable that as they are all regularly mown their surface has nothing of that mellow tone and variety of hues by which mountain turf that is never touched by the scythe is distinguished <\s>
<s> on the smooth and steep slopes of the swiss hills these plots of verdure do indeed agreeably unite their colour with that of the deciduous trees or make a lively contrast with the dark green pine groves that define them and among which they run in endless variety of shapes but this is most pleasing at first sight the permanent gratification of the eye requires finer gradations of tone and a more delicate blending of hues into each other <\s>
<s> besides it is only in spring and late autumn that cattle animate by their presence the swiss lawns and though the pastures of the higher regions where they feed during the summer are left in their natural state of flowery herbage those pastures are so remote that their texture and colour are of no consequence in the composition of any picture in which a lake of the vales is a feature <\s>
<s> yet in those lofty regions how vegetation is invigorated by the genial climate of that country <\s>
<s> among the luxuriant flowers there met with groves or forests if i may so call them of monks hood are frequently seen the plant of deep rich blue and as tall as in our gardens and this at an elevation where in cumberland icelandic moss would only be found or the stony summits be utterly bare <\s>
<s> we have then for the colouring of switzerland principally a vivid green herbage black woods and dazzling snows presented in masses with a grandeur to which no one can be insensible but not often graduated by nature into soothing harmony and so ill suited to the pencil that though abundance of good subjects may be there found they are not such as can be deemed characteristic of the country nor is this unfitness confined to colour the forms of the mountains though many of them in some points of view the noblest that can be conceived are apt to run into spikes and needles and present a jagged outline which has a mean effect transferred to canvass <\s>
<s> this must have been felt by the ancient masters for if i am not mistaken they have not left a single landscape the materials of which are taken from the peculiar features of the alps yet titian passed his life almost in their neighbourhood the poussins and claude must have been well acquainted with their aspects and several admirable painters as tibaldi and luino were born among the italian alps <\s>
<s> a few experiments have lately been made by englishmen but they only prove that courage skill and judgment may surmount any obstacles and it may be safely affirmed that they who have done best in this bold adventure will be the least likely to repeat the attempt <\s>
<s> but though our scenes are better suited to painting than those of the alps i should be sorry to contemplate either country in reference to that art further than as its fitness or unfitness for the pencil renders it more or less pleasing to the eye of the spectator who has learned to observe and feel chiefly from nature herself <\s>
<s> deeming the points in which alpine imagery is superior to british too obvious to be insisted upon i will observe that the deciduous woods though in many places unapproachable by the axe and triumphing in the pomp and prodigality of nature have in general 63 neither the variety nor beauty which would exist in those of the mountains of britain if left to themselves <\s>
<s> magnificent walnut trees grow upon the plains of switzerland and fine trees of that species are found scattered over the hill sides birches also grow here and there in luxuriant beauty but neither these nor oaks are ever a prevailing tree nor can even be said to be common and the oaks as far as i had an opportunity of observing are greatly inferior to those of britain <\s>
<s> among the interior vallies the proportion of beeches and pines is so great that other trees are scarcely noticeable and surely such woods are at all seasons much less agreeable than that rich and harmonious distribution of oak ash elm birch and alder that formerly clothed the sides of snowdon and helvellyn and of which no mean remains still survive at the head of ulswater <\s>
<s> on the italian side of the alps chesnut and walnut trees grow at a considerable height on the mountains but even there the foliage is not equal in beauty to the natural product of this climate <\s>
<s> in fact the sunshine of the south of europe so envied when heard of at a distance is in many respects injurious to rural beauty particularly as it incites to the cultivation of spots of ground which in colder climates would be left in the hands of nature favouring at the same time the culture of plants that are more valuable on account of the fruit they produce to gratify the palate than for affording pleasure to the eye as materials of landscape <\s>
<s> take for instance the promontory of bellagio so fortunate in its command of the three branches of the lake of como yet the ridge of the promontory itself being for the most part covered with vines interspersed with olive trees accords but ill with the vastness of the green unappropriated mountains and derogates not a little from the sublimity of those finely contrasted pictures to which it is a foreground <\s>
<s> the vine when cultivated upon a large scale notwithstanding all that may be said of it in poetry 64 makes but a dull formal appearance in landscape and the olive tree though one is loth to say so is not more grateful to the eye than our common willow which it much resembles but the hoariness of hue common to both has in the aquatic plant an appropriate delicacy harmonising with the situation in which it most delights <\s>
<s> the same may no doubt be said of the olive among the dry rocks of attica but i am speaking of it as found in gardens and vineyards in the north of italy <\s>
<s> at bellagio what englishman can resist the temptation of substituting in his fancy for these formal treasures of cultivation the natural variety of one of our parks its pastured lawns coverts of hawthorn of wild rose and honeysuckle and the majesty of forest trees such wild graces as the banks of derwent water shewed in the time of the ratcliffes and growbarrow park lowther and rydal do at this day <\s>
<s> 63 the greatest variety of trees is found in the valais <\s>
<s> as my object is to reconcile a briton to the scenery of his own country though not at the expense of truth i am not afraid of asserting that in many points of view our lakes also are much more interesting than those of the alps first as is implied above from being more happily proportioned to the other features of the landscape and next both as being infinitely more pellucid and less subject to agitation from the winds 65 64 lucretius has charmingly described a scene of this kind <\s>
<s> inque dies magis in montem succedere sylvas cogebant infráquo locum coucedere cultis prata lacus rivos segetes vinetaque laeta collibus et campis ut haberent atque olearum caerula distinguens inter plaga currere posset per tumulos et convalleis camposque profusa ut nunc esse vides vario distincta lepore onmia quae pomis intersita dulcibus ornant arbustisque teneut felicibus obsita circúm <\s>
<s> 65 it is remarkable that como as is probably the case with other italian lakes is more troubled by storms in summer than in winter <\s>
<s> hence the propriety of the following verses lari <\s>
<s> margine ubique confragoso nulli coelicolum negas sacellum picto pariete saxeoque tecto hinc miracula multa navitarum audis nee placido refellis ore sed nova usque pavas noto vel euro aestivas quatieutibus cavernas vel surgentis ab adduae cubili caeco grandinis imbre provoluto <\s>
<s> como which may perhaps be styled the king of lakes as lugano is certainly the queen is disturbed by a periodical wind blowing from the head in the morning and towards it in the afternoon <\s>
<s> the magnificent lake of the four cantons especially its noblest division called the lake of uri is not only much agitated by winds but in the night time is disturbed from the bottom as i was told and indeed as i witnessed without any apparent commotion in the air and when at rest the water is not pure to the eye but of a heavy green hue as is that of all the other lakes apparently according to the degree in which they are fed by melted snows <\s>
<s> if the lake of geneva furnish an exception this is probably owing to its vast extent which allows the water to deposit its impurities <\s>
<s> the water of the english lakes on the contrary being of a crystalline clearness the reflections of the surrounding hills are frequently so lively that it is scarcely possible to distinguish the point where the real object terminates and its unsubstantial duplicate begins <\s>
<s> the lower part of the lake of geneva from its narrowness must be much less subject to agitation than the higher divisions and as the water is clearer than that of the other swiss lakes it will frequently exhibit this appearance though it is scarcely possible in an equal degree <\s>
<s> during two comprehensive tours among the alps i did not observe except on one of the smaller lakes between lugano and ponte tresa a single instance of those beautiful repetitions of surrounding objects on the bosom of the water which are so frequently seen here not to speak of the fine dazzling trembling net work breezy motions and streaks and circles of intermingled smooth and rippled water which make the surface of our lakes a field of endless variety <\s>
<s> but among the alps where every thing tends to the grand and the sublime in surfaces as well as in forms if the lakes do not court the placid reflections of land objects those of first rate magnitude make compensation in some degree by exhibiting those ever changing fields of green blue and purple shadows or lights one scarcely knows which to name them that call to mind a sea prospect contemplated from a lofty cliff <\s>
<s> the subject of torrents and waterfalls has already been touched upon but it may be added that in switzerland the perpetual accompaniment of snow upon the higher regions takes much from the effect of foaming white streams while from their frequency they obstruct each other's influence upon the mind of the spectator and in all cases the effect of an individual cataract excepting the great fall of the rhine at schaffhausen is diminished by the general fury of the stream of which it is a part <\s>
<s> recurring to the reflections from still water i will describe a singular phenomenon of this kind of which i was an eye witness <\s>

<s> true it is qui bene distinguit bene docet yet fastidiousness is a wretched travelling companion and the best guide to which in matters of taste we can entrust ourselves is a disposition to be pleased <\s>
<s> for example if a traveller be among the alps let him surrender up his mind to the fury of the gigantic torrents and take delight in the contemplation of their almost irresistible violence without complaining of the monotony of their foaming course or being disgusted with the muddiness of the water apparent even where it is violently agitated <\s>
<s> in cumberland and westmoreland let not the comparative weakness of the streams prevent him from sympathising with such impetuosity as they possess and making the most of the present objects let him as he justly may do observe with admiration the unrivalled brilliancy of the water and that variety of motion mood and character that arises out of the want of those resources by which the power of the streams in the alps is supported again with respect to the mountains though these are comparatively of diminutive size though there is little of perpetual snow and no voice of summer avalanches is heard among them and though traces left by the ravage of the elements are here comparatively rare and unimpressive yet out of this very deficiency proceeds a sense of stability and permanence that is to many minds more grateful while the hoarse rushes to the sweeping breeze sigh forth their ancient melodies <\s>
<s> among the alps are few places that do not preclude this feeling of tranquil sublimity <\s>
<s> havoc and ruin and desolation and encroachment are everywhere more or less obtruded and it is difficult notwithstanding the naked loftiness of the pikes and the snow capped summits of the mounts to escape from the depressing sensation that the whole are in a rapid process of dissolution and were it not that the destructive agency must abate as the heights diminish would in time to come be levelled with the plains <\s>
<s> nevertheless i would relish to the utmost the demonstrations of every species of power at work to effect such changes <\s>
<s> from these general views let us descend a moment to detail <\s>
<s> a stranger to mountain imagery naturally on his first arrival looks out for sublimity in every object that admits of it and is almost always disappointed <\s>
<s> for this disappointment there exists i believe no general preventive nor is it desirable that there should <\s>
<s> but with regard to one class of objects there is a point in which injurious expectations may be easily corrected <\s>
<s> it is generally supposed that waterfalls are scarcely worth being looked at except after much rain and that the more swoln the stream the more fortunate the spectator but this however is true only of large cataracts with sublime accompaniments and not even of these without some drawbacks <\s>
<s> in other instances what becomes at such a time of that sense of refreshing coolness which can only be felt in dry and sunny weather when the rocks herbs and flowers glisten with moisture diffused by the breath of the precipitous water <\s>
<s> but considering these things as objects of sight only it may be observed that the principal charm of the smaller waterfalls or cascades consists in certain proportions of form and affinities of colour among the component parts of the scene and in the contrast maintained between the falling water and that which is apparently at rest or rather settling gradually into quiet in the pool below <\s>
<s> the beauty of such a scene where there is naturally so much agitation is also heightened in a peculiar manner by the glimmering and towards the verge of the pool by the steady reflection of the surrounding images <\s>
<s> now all those delicate distinctions are destroyed by heavy floods and the whole stream rushes along in foam and tumultuous confusion <\s>
<s> a happy proportion of component parts is indeed noticeable among the landscapes of the north of england and in this characteristic essential to a perfect picture they surpass the scenes of scotland and in a still greater degree those of switzerland <\s>
<s> as a resident among the lakes i frequently hear the scenery of this country compared with that of the alps and therefore a few words shall be added to what has been incidentally said upon that subject <\s>
<s> if we could recall to this region of lakes the native pine forests with which many hundred years ago a large portion of the heights was covered then during spring and autumn it might frequently with much propriety be compared to switzerland the elements of the landscape would be the same one country representing the other in miniature <\s>
<s> towns villages churches rural seats bridges and roads green meadows and arable grounds with their various produce and deciduous woods of diversified foliage which occupy the vales and lower regions of the mountains would as in switzerland be divided by dark forests from ridges and round topped heights covered with snow and from pikes and sharp declivities imperfectly arrayed in the same glittering mantle and the resemblance would be still more perfect on those days when vapours resting upon and floating around the summits leave the elevation of the mountains less dependent upon the eye than on the imagination <\s>
<s> but the pine forests have wholly disappeared and only during late spring and early autumn is realised here that assemblage of the imagery of different seasons which is exhibited through the whole summer among the alps winter in the distance and warmth leafy woods verdure and fertility at hand and widely diffused <\s>
<s> striking then from among the permanent materials of the landscape that stage of vegetation which is occupied by pine forests and above that the perennial snows we have mountains the highest of which little exceed 3000 feet while some of the alps do not fall short of 14,000 or 15,000 and 8000 or 10,000 is not an uncommon elevation <\s>
<s> our tracts of wood and water are almost diminutive in comparison therefore as far as sublimity is dependent upon absolute bulk and height and atmospherical influences in connection with these it is obvious that there can be no rivalship <\s>
<s> but a short residence among the british mountains will furnish abundant proof that after a certain point of elevation viz <\s>
<s> that which allows of compact and fleecy clouds settling upon or sweeping over the summits the sense of sublimity depends more upon form and relation of objects to each other than upon their actual magnitude and that an elevation of 3000 feet is sufficient to call forth in a most impressive degree the creative and magnifying and softening powers of the atmosphere <\s>
<s> hence on the score even of sublimity the superiority of the alps is by no means so great as might hastily be inferred and as to the beauty of the lower regions of the swiss mountains it is noticeable that as they are all regularly mown their surface has nothing of that mellow tone and variety of hues by which mountain turf that is never touched by the scythe is distinguished <\s>
<s> on the smooth and steep slopes of the swiss hills these plots of verdure do indeed agreeably unite their colour with that of the deciduous trees or make a lively contrast with the dark green pine groves that define them and among which they run in endless variety of shapes but this is most pleasing at first sight the permanent gratification of the eye requires finer gradations of tone and a more delicate blending of hues into each other <\s>
<s> besides it is only in spring and late autumn that cattle animate by their presence the swiss lawns and though the pastures of the higher regions where they feed during the summer are left in their natural state of flowery herbage those pastures are so remote that their texture and colour are of no consequence in the composition of any picture in which a lake of the vales is a feature <\s>
<s> yet in those lofty regions how vegetation is invigorated by the genial climate of that country <\s>
<s> among the luxuriant flowers there met with groves or forests if i may so call them of monks hood are frequently seen the plant of deep rich blue and as tall as in our gardens and this at an elevation where in cumberland icelandic moss would only be found or the stony summits be utterly bare <\s>
<s> we have then for the colouring of switzerland principally a vivid green herbage black woods and dazzling snows presented in masses with a grandeur to which no one can be insensible but not often graduated by nature into soothing harmony and so ill suited to the pencil that though abundance of good subjects may be there found they are not such as can be deemed characteristic of the country nor is this unfitness confined to colour the forms of the mountains though many of them in some points of view the noblest that can be conceived are apt to run into spikes and needles and present a jagged outline which has a mean effect transferred to canvass <\s>
<s> this must have been felt by the ancient masters for if i am not mistaken they have not left a single landscape the materials of which are taken from the peculiar features of the alps yet titian passed his life almost in their neighbourhood the poussins and claude must have been well acquainted with their aspects and several admirable painters as tibaldi and luino were born among the italian alps <\s>
<s> a few experiments have lately been made by englishmen but they only prove that courage skill and judgment may surmount any obstacles and it may be safely affirmed that they who have done best in this bold adventure will be the least likely to repeat the attempt <\s>
<s> but though our scenes are better suited to painting than those of the alps i should be sorry to contemplate either country in reference to that art further than as its fitness or unfitness for the pencil renders it more or less pleasing to the eye of the spectator who has learned to observe and feel chiefly from nature herself <\s>
<s> deeming the points in which alpine imagery is superior to british too obvious to be insisted upon i will observe that the deciduous woods though in many places unapproachable by the axe and triumphing in the pomp and prodigality of nature have in general 63 neither the variety nor beauty which would exist in those of the mountains of britain if left to themselves <\s>
<s> magnificent walnut trees grow upon the plains of switzerland and fine trees of that species are found scattered over the hill sides birches also grow here and there in luxuriant beauty but neither these nor oaks are ever a prevailing tree nor can even be said to be common and the oaks as far as i had an opportunity of observing are greatly inferior to those of britain <\s>
<s> among the interior vallies the proportion of beeches and pines is so great that other trees are scarcely noticeable and surely such woods are at all seasons much less agreeable than that rich and harmonious distribution of oak ash elm birch and alder that formerly clothed the sides of snowdon and helvellyn and of which no mean remains still survive at the head of ulswater <\s>
<s> on the italian side of the alps chesnut and walnut trees grow at a considerable height on the mountains but even there the foliage is not equal in beauty to the natural product of this climate <\s>
<s> in fact the sunshine of the south of europe so envied when heard of at a distance is in many respects injurious to rural beauty particularly as it incites to the cultivation of spots of ground which in colder climates would be left in the hands of nature favouring at the same time the culture of plants that are more valuable on account of the fruit they produce to gratify the palate than for affording pleasure to the eye as materials of landscape <\s>
<s> take for instance the promontory of bellagio so fortunate in its command of the three branches of the lake of como yet the ridge of the promontory itself being for the most part covered with vines interspersed with olive trees accords but ill with the vastness of the green unappropriated mountains and derogates not a little from the sublimity of those finely contrasted pictures to which it is a foreground <\s>
<s> the vine when cultivated upon a large scale notwithstanding all that may be said of it in poetry 64 makes but a dull formal appearance in landscape and the olive tree though one is loth to say so is not more grateful to the eye than our common willow which it much resembles but the hoariness of hue common to both has in the aquatic plant an appropriate delicacy harmonising with the situation in which it most delights <\s>
<s> the same may no doubt be said of the olive among the dry rocks of attica but i am speaking of it as found in gardens and vineyards in the north of italy <\s>
<s> at bellagio what englishman can resist the temptation of substituting in his fancy for these formal treasures of cultivation the natural variety of one of our parks its pastured lawns coverts of hawthorn of wild rose and honeysuckle and the majesty of forest trees such wild graces as the banks of derwent water shewed in the time of the ratcliffes and growbarrow park lowther and rydal do at this day <\s>
<s> 63 the greatest variety of trees is found in the valais <\s>
<s> as my object is to reconcile a briton to the scenery of his own country though not at the expense of truth i am not afraid of asserting that in many points of view our lakes also are much more interesting than those of the alps first as is implied above from being more happily proportioned to the other features of the landscape and next both as being infinitely more pellucid and less subject to agitation from the winds 65 64 lucretius has charmingly described a scene of this kind <\s>
<s> inque dies magis in montem succedere sylvas cogebant infráquo locum coucedere cultis prata lacus rivos segetes vinetaque laeta collibus et campis ut haberent atque olearum caerula distinguens inter plaga currere posset per tumulos et convalleis camposque profusa ut nunc esse vides vario distincta lepore onmia quae pomis intersita dulcibus ornant arbustisque teneut felicibus obsita circúm <\s>
<s> 65 it is remarkable that como as is probably the case with other italian lakes is more troubled by storms in summer than in winter <\s>
<s> hence the propriety of the following verses lari <\s>
<s> margine ubique confragoso nulli coelicolum negas sacellum picto pariete saxeoque tecto hinc miracula multa navitarum audis nee placido refellis ore sed nova usque pavas noto vel euro aestivas quatieutibus cavernas vel surgentis ab adduae cubili caeco grandinis imbre provoluto <\s>
<s> como which may perhaps be styled the king of lakes as lugano is certainly the queen is disturbed by a periodical wind blowing from the head in the morning and towards it in the afternoon <\s>
<s> the magnificent lake of the four cantons especially its noblest division called the lake of uri is not only much agitated by winds but in the night time is disturbed from the bottom as i was told and indeed as i witnessed without any apparent commotion in the air and when at rest the water is not pure to the eye but of a heavy green hue as is that of all the other lakes apparently according to the degree in which they are fed by melted snows <\s>
<s> if the lake of geneva furnish an exception this is probably owing to its vast extent which allows the water to deposit its impurities <\s>
<s> the water of the english lakes on the contrary being of a crystalline clearness the reflections of the surrounding hills are frequently so lively that it is scarcely possible to distinguish the point where the real object terminates and its unsubstantial duplicate begins <\s>
<s> the lower part of the lake of geneva from its narrowness must be much less subject to agitation than the higher divisions and as the water is clearer than that of the other swiss lakes it will frequently exhibit this appearance though it is scarcely possible in an equal degree <\s>
<s> during two comprehensive tours among the alps i did not observe except on one of the smaller lakes between lugano and ponte tresa a single instance of those beautiful repetitions of surrounding objects on the bosom of the water which are so frequently seen here not to speak of the fine dazzling trembling net work breezy motions and streaks and circles of intermingled smooth and rippled water which make the surface of our lakes a field of endless variety <\s>
<s> but among the alps where every thing tends to the grand and the sublime in surfaces as well as in forms if the lakes do not court the placid reflections of land objects those of first rate magnitude make compensation in some degree by exhibiting those ever changing fields of green blue and purple shadows or lights one scarcely knows which to name them that call to mind a sea prospect contemplated from a lofty cliff <\s>
<s> the subject of torrents and waterfalls has already been touched upon but it may be added that in switzerland the perpetual accompaniment of snow upon the higher regions takes much from the effect of foaming white streams while from their frequency they obstruct each other's influence upon the mind of the spectator and in all cases the effect of an individual cataract excepting the great fall of the rhine at schaffhausen is diminished by the general fury of the stream of which it is a part <\s>
<s> recurring to the reflections from still water i will describe a singular phenomenon of this kind of which i was an eye witness <\s>
<s> walking by the side of ulswater upon a calm september morning i saw deep within the bosom of the lake a magnificent castle with towers and battlements nothing could be more distinct than the whole edifice <\s>
<s> after gazing with delight upon it for some time as upon a work of enchantment i could not but regret that my previous knowledge of the place enabled me to account for the appearance <\s>
<s> it was in fact the reflection of a pleasure house called lyulph's tower the towers and battlements magnified and so much changed in shape as not to be immediately recognised <\s>
<s> in the meanwhile the pleasure house itself was altogether hidden from my view by a body of vapour stretching over it and along the hill side on which it stands but not so as to have intercepted its communication with the lake and hence this novel and most impressive object which if i had been a stranger to the spot would from its being inexplicable have long detained the mind in a state of pleasing astonishment <\s>
<s> appearances of this kind acting upon the credulity of early ages may have given birth to and favoured the belief in stories of sub aqueous palaces gardens and pleasure grounds the brilliant ornaments of romance <\s>
<s> with this inverted scene i will couple a much more extraordinary phenomenon which will show how other elegant fancies may have had their origin less in invention than in the actual processes of nature <\s>
<s> about eleven o'clock on the forenoon of a winter's day coming suddenly in company of a friend into view of the lake of grasmere we were alarmed by the sight of a newly created island the transitory thought of the moment was that it had been produced by an earthquake or some other convulsion of nature <\s>
<s> recovering from the alarm which was greater than the reader can possibly sympathise with but which was shared to its full extent by my companion we proceeded to examine the object before us <\s>
<s> the elevation of this new island exceeded considerably that of the old one its neighbour it was likewise larger in circumference comprehending a space of about five acres its surface rocky speckled with snow and sprinkled over with birch trees it was divided towards the south from the other island by a narrow frith and in like manner from the northern shore of the lake on the east and west it was separated from the shore by a much larger space of smooth water <\s>
<s> marvellous was the illusion <\s>
<s> comparing the new with the old island the surface of which is soft green and unvaried i do not scruple to say that as an object of sight it was much the more distinct <\s>
<s> how little faith we exclaimed is due to one sense unless its evidence be confirmed by some of its fellows <\s>
<s> what stranger could possibly be persuaded that this which we know to be an unsubstantial mockery is really so and that there exists only a single island on this beautiful lake <\s>
<s> at length the appearance underwent a gradual transmutation it lost its prominence and passed into a glimmering and dim inversion and then totally disappeared leaving behind it a clear open area of ice of the same dimensions <\s>
<s> we now perceived that this bed of ice which was thinly suffused with water had produced the illusion by reflecting and refracting as persons skilled in optics would no doubt easily explain a rocky and woody section of the opposite mountain named silver how <\s>
<s> having dwelt so much upon the beauty of pure and still water and pointed out the advantage which the lakes of the north of england have in this particular over those of the alps it would be injustice not to advert to the sublimity that must often be given to alpine scenes by the agitations to which those vast bodies of diffused water are there subject <\s>
<s> i have witnessed many tremendous thunder storms among the alps and the most glorious effects of light and shadow but i never happened to be present when any lake was agitated by those hurricanes which i imagine must often torment them <\s>
<s> if the commotions be at all proportionable to the expanse and depth of the waters and the height of the surrounding mountains then if i may judge from what is frequently seen here the exhibition must be awful and astonishing on this day march 30 1822 the winds have been acting upon the small lake of rydal as if they had received command to carry its waters from their bed into the sky the white billows in different quarters disappeared under clouds or rather drifts of spray that were whirled along and up into the air by scouring winds charging each other in squadrons in every direction upon the lake <\s>
<s> the spray having been hurried aloft till it lost its consistency and whiteness was driven along the mountain tops like flying showers that vanish in the distance <\s>
<s> frequently an eddying wind scooped the waters out of the basin and forced them upwards in the very shape of an icelandic geyser or boiling fountain to the height of several hundred feet <\s>
<s> this small mere of rydal from its position is subject in a peculiar degree to these commotions <\s>
<s> the present season however is unusually stormy great numbers of fish two of them not less than 12 pounds weight were a few days ago cast on the shores of derwent water by the force of the waves <\s>
<s> lest in the foregoing comparative estimate i should be suspected of partiality to my native mountains i will support my general opinion by the authority of mr <\s>
<s> west whose guide to the lakes has been eminently serviceable to the tourist for nearly 50 years <\s>
<s> the author a roman catholic clergyman had passed much time abroad and was well acquainted with the scenery of the continent <\s>
<s> he thus expresses himself they who intend to make the continental tour should begin here as it will give in miniature an idea of what they are to meet with there in traversing the alps and appenines to which our northern mountains are not inferior in beauty of line or variety of summit number of lakes and transparency of water not in colouring of rock or softness of turf but in height and extent only <\s>
<s> the mountains here are all accessible to the summit and furnish prospects no less surprising and with more variety than the alps themselves <\s>

<s> klopstock to the house of his brother the poet which stands about a quarter of a mile from the city gate <\s>
<s> it is one of a row of little common place summer houses for so they looked with four or five rows of young meagre elm trees before the windows beyond which is a green and then a dead flat intersected with several roads <\s>
<s> whatever beauty thought i may be before the poet's eyes at present it must certainly be purely of his own creation <\s>
<s> we waited a few minutes in a neat little parlour ornamented with the figures of two of the muses and with prints the subjects of which were from klopstock's odes 225 225 there is a rhetorical amplitude and brilliancy in the messias says mr <\s>
<s> carlyle which elicits in our critic mr <\s>
<s> taylor an instinct truer than his philosophy is <\s>
<s> neither has the still purer spirit of klopstock's odes escaped him <\s>
<s> perhaps there is no writing in our language that offers so correct an emblem of him as this analysis <\s>
<s> i remember thinking taylor's clear outline of the messias the most satisfying account of a poem i ever read it fills the mind with a vision of pomp and magnificence which it is pleasanter to contemplate as it were from afar massed together in that general survey than to examine part by part <\s>
<s> carlyle agree in exalting that ode of klopstock's in which he represents the muse of britain and the muse of germany running a race <\s>
<s> the piece seems to me more rhetorical than strictly poetical and if the younger muse's power of keeping up the race depends on productions of this sort i would not give a penny for her chance at least if the contest relates to pure poetry <\s>
<s> klopstock's herman mentioned afterwards consists of three chorus dramas as mr <\s>
<s> taylor calls them the battle of herman herman and the princes and the death of herman <\s>
<s> herman is the arminius of the roman historians <\s>
<s> i was much disappointed in his countenance and recognised in it no likeness to the bust <\s>
<s> there was no comprehension in the forehead no weight over the eye brows no expression of peculiarity moral or intellectual on the eyes no massiveness in the general countenance <\s>
<s> he is if anything rather below the middle size <\s>
<s> he wore very large half boots which his legs filled so fearfully were they swollen <\s>
<s> however though neither w nor myself could discover any indications of sublimity or enthusiasm in his physiognomy we were both equally impressed with his liveliness and his kind and ready courtesy <\s>
<s> he talked in french with my friend and with difficulty spoke a few sentences to me in english <\s>
<s> his enunciation was not in the least affected by the entire want of his upper teeth <\s>
<s> the conversation began on his part by the expression of his rapture at the surrender of the detachment of french troops under general humbert <\s>
<s> their proceedings in ireland with regard to the committee which they had appointed with the rest of their organizing system seemed to have given the poet great entertainment <\s>
<s> he then declared his sanguine belief in nelson's victory and anticipated its confirmation with a keen and triumphant pleasure <\s>
<s> his words tones looks implied the most vehement anti gallicanism <\s>
<s> the subject changed to literature and i inquired in latin concerning the history of german poetry and the elder german poets <\s>
<s> to my great astonishment he confessed that he knew very little on the subject <\s>
<s> he had indeed occasionally read one or two of their elder writers but not so as to enable him to speak of their merits <\s>
<s> professor ebeling he said would probably give me every information of this kind the subject had not particularly excited his curiosity <\s>
<s> he then talked of milton and glover and thought glover's blank verse superiour to milton's 226 226 leonidus an epic poem by r <\s>
<s> glover first appeared in may 1737 in the fifth edition published in 1770 it was corrected and extended from nine books to twelve <\s>
<s> glover was the author of boadicea and medea tragedies which had some success on the stage <\s>
<s> i believe that leonidas has more merit in the conduct of the design and in the delineation of character than as poetry <\s>
<s> he write an epic poem said thomson who never saw a mountain <\s>
<s> glover had seen the sun and moon yet he seems to have looked for their poetical aspects in homer and milton rather than in the sky <\s>
<s> there is not a single simile in leonidas says lyttleton that is borrowed from any of the ancients and yet there is hardly any poem that has such a variety of beautiful comparisons <\s>
<s> the similes of milton come so flat and dry out of glover's mangle that they are indeed quite another thing from what they appear in the poems of that immortal ex <\s>
<s> gr like wintry clouds which opening for a time tinge their black folds with gleams of scattered light is not this milton's silver lining stretched and mangled <\s>
<s> the queen of night gleam'd from the centre of th etherial vault and o'er the raven plumes of darkness shed her placid light <\s>
<s> this is flattened from the well known passage in comus <\s>
<s> soon will savage mars deform the lovely ringlets of thy shrubs <\s>
<s> a genteel improvement upon milton's bush with frizzled hair implicit <\s>
<s> then we have delicious to the sight soft dales meand'ring show their flowery laps among rude piles of nature spoiled from the flowery lap of some irriguous valley spread its store <\s>
<s> thus does this poet shatter and dissolve the blooming sprays of another man's plantation instead of pushing through them some new shoots of his own to crown them with fresh blossoms <\s>
<s> milton himself borrowed as much as glover <\s>
<s> aye ten times more yet every passage in his poetry is miltonic more than anything else <\s>
<s> on the other hand his imitators miltonize yet produce nothing worthy of milton the important characteristic of whose writings my father well expressed when he said the reader of milton must be always on his duty he is surrounded with sense <\s>
<s> a man must have his sense to imitate him worthily <\s>
<s> how we look through his words at the deluge as he floods it upon us in book xi <\s>
<s> 738 53 the attic bees produce honey so flavoured with the thyme of hymettus that it is scarcely eatable though to smell the herb itself in a breezy walk upon that celebrated mount would be an exceeding pleasure thus certain epic poems are overpoweringly flavoured with herbs of milton while yet the fragrant balm and fresh breeze of his poetry is not to be found in them <\s>
<s> w and myself expressed our surprise and my friend gave his definition and notion of harmonious verse that it consisted the english iambic blank verse above all in the apt arrangement of pauses and cadences and the sweep of whole paragraphs with many a winding bout of linked sweetness long drawn out and not in the even flow much less in the prominence or antithetic vigour of single lines which were indeed injurious to the total effect except where they were introduced for some specific purpose <\s>
<s> klopstock assented and said that he meant to confine glover's superiority to single lines 227 227 the abrupt and laconic structure of glover's periods appears at the very commencement of leonidas which has something military in its movement but rather the stiff gait of the drilled soldier than the proud march of the martial hero <\s>
<s> the virtuous spartan who resign'd his life to save his country at th oetaen straits thermopylae when all the peopled east in arms with xerxes filled the grecian plains o muse record <\s>
<s> the hellespont they passed o'erpowering thrace <\s>
<s> the dreadful tidings swift to corinth flew <\s>
<s> her isthmus was the seat of grecian council <\s>
<s> orpheus thence returns to lacedaemon <\s>
<s> in assembly full c <\s>
<s> glover's best passages are of a soft character <\s>
<s> this is a pleasing homerism lycis dies for boist'rous war ill chosen <\s>
<s> he was skill'd to tune the lulling flute and melt the heart or with his pipe's awak'ning strains allure the lovely dames of lydia to the dance <\s>
<s> they on the verdant level graceful mov'd in vary'd measures while the cooling breeze beneath their swelling garments wanton'd o'er their snowy breasts and smooth cayster's streams soft gliding murmur'd by <\s>

<s> 109 placid were his days which flow'd through blessings <\s>
<s> as a river pure whose sides are flowery and whose meadows fair meets in his course a subterranean void there dips his silver head again to rise and rising glide through flow'rs and meadows new so shall oïleus in those happier fields where never tempests roar nor humid clouds in mists dissolve nor white descending flakes of winter violate th eternal green where never gloom of trouble shades the mind nor gust of passion heaves the quiet breast nor dews of grief are sprinkled <\s>
<s> he told us that he had read milton in a prose translation when he was fourteen 228 i understood him thus myself and w interpreted klopstock's french as i had already construed it <\s>
<s> he appeared to know very little of milton or indeed of our poets in general <\s>
<s> he spoke with great indignation of the english prose translation of his messiah <\s>
<s> all the translations had been bad very bad but the english was no translation there were pages on pages not in the original and half the original was not to be found in the translation <\s>
<s> w told him that i intended to translate a few of his odes as specimens of german lyrics he then said to me in english i wish you would render into english some select passages of the messiah and revenge me of your countryman <\s>
<s> 228 this was accidentally confirmed to me by an old german gentleman at helmstadt who had been klopstock's school and bed fellow <\s>
<s> among other boyish anecdotes he related that the young poet set a particular value on a translation of the paradise lost and always slept with it under his pillow <\s>
<s> it was the liveliest thing which he produced in the whole conversation <\s>
<s> he told us that his first ode was fifty years older than his last <\s>
<s> i looked at him with much emotion i considered him as the venerable father of german poetry as a good man as a christian seventy four years old with legs enormously swollen yet active lively cheerful and kind and communicative <\s>
<s> my eyes felt as if a tear were swelling into them <\s>
<s> in the portrait of lessing there was a toupee periwig which enormously injured the effect of his physiognomy klopstock wore the same powdered and frizzled <\s>
<s> by the bye old men ought never to wear powder the contrast between a large snow white wig and the colour of an old man's skin is disgusting and wrinkles in such a neighbourhood appear only channels for dirt <\s>
<s> it is an honour to poets and great men that you think of them as parts of nature and anything of trick and fashion wounds you in them as much as when you see venerable yews clipped into miserable peacocks the author of the messiah should have worn his own grey hair his powder and periwig were to the eye what mr <\s>
<s> virgil would be to the ear <\s>
<s> klopstock dwelt much on the superiour power which the german language possessed of concentrating meaning <\s>
<s> he said he had often translated parts of homer and virgil line by line and a german line proved always sufficient for a greek or latin one <\s>
<s> in english you cannot do this <\s>
<s> i answered that in english we could commonly render one greek heroic line in a line and a half of our common heroic metre and i conjectured that this line and a half would be found to contain no more syllables than one german or greek hexameter <\s>
<s> he did not understand me :[ 229 and i who wished to hear his opinions not to correct them was glad that he did not <\s>
<s> 229 klopstock's observation was partly true and partly erroneous <\s>
<s> in the literal sense of his words and if we confine the comparison to the average of space required for the expression of the same thought in the two languages it is erroneous <\s>
<s> i have translated some german hexameters into english hexameters and find that on the average three english lines will express four lines german <\s>
<s> the reason is evident our language abounds in monosyllables and dissyllables <\s>
<s> the german not less than the greek is a polysyllable language <\s>
<s> but in another point of view the remark was not without foundation <\s>

<s> on leaving the fields of sandwyke while ascending by a gentle slope along the valley of martindale we had occasion to observe that in thinly peopled glens of this character the general want of wood gives a peculiar interest to the scattered cottages embowered in sycamore <\s>
<s> towards its head this valley splits into two parts and in one of these that to the left there is no house nor any building to be seen but a cattle shed on the side of a hill which is sprinkled over with trees evidently the remains of an extensive forest <\s>

<s> a few old trees remain relics of the forest a little stream hastens though with serpentine windings through the uncultivated hollow where many cattle were pasturing <\s>
<s> the cattle of this country are generally white or light coloured but these were dark brown or black which heightened the resemblance this scene bears to many parts of the highlands of scotland while we paused to rest upon the hill side though well contented with the quiet every day sounds the lowing of cattle bleating of sheep and the very gentle murmuring of the valley stream we could not but think what a grand effect the music of the bugle horn would have among these mountains <\s>
<s> it is still heard once every year at the chase i have spoken of a day of festivity for the inhabitants of this district except the poor deer the most ancient of them all <\s>
<s> our ascent even to the top was very easy when it was accomplished we had exceedingly fine views some of the lofty fells being resplendent with sunshine and others partly shrouded by clouds <\s>
<s> ullswater bordered by black steeps was of dazzling brightness the plain beyond penrith smooth and bright or rather gleamy as the sea or sea sands <\s>
<s> looked down into boardale which like stybarrow has been named from the wild swine that formerly abounded here but it has now no sylvan covert being smooth and bare a long narrow deep cradle shaped glen lying so sheltered that one would be pleased to see it planted by human hands there being a sufficiency of soil and the trees would be sheltered almost like shrubs in a green house after having walked some way along the top of the hill came in view of glenriddin and the mountains at the head of grisdale before we began to descend turned aside to a small ruin called at this day the chapel where it is said the inhabitants of martindale and patterdale were accustomed to assemble for worship <\s>
<s> there are now no traces from which you could infer for what use the building had been erected the loose stones and the few which yet continue piled up resemble those which lie elsewhere on the mountain but the shape of the building having been oblong its remains differ from those of a common sheep fold and it has stood east and west <\s>
<s> scarcely did the druids when they fled to these fastnesses perform their rites in any situation more exposed to disturbance from the elements <\s>
<s> one cannot pass by without being reminded that the rustic psalmody must have had the accompaniment of many a wildly whistling blast and what dismal storms must have often drowned the voice of the preacher <\s>
<s> as we descend patterdale opens upon the eye in grand simplicity screened by mountains and proceeding from two heads deep dale and hartshope where lies the little lake of brotherswater named in old maps broaderwater and probably rightly so for bassenthwaite mere at this day is familiarly called broadwater but the change in the appellation of this small lake or pool if it be a corruption may have been assisted by some melancholy accident similar to what happened about twenty years ago when two brothers were drowned there having gone out to take their holiday pleasure upon the ice on a new year's day <\s>
<s> a rough and precipitous peat track brought us down to our friend's house another fine moonlight night but a thick fog rising from the neighbouring river enveloped the rocky and wood crested knoll on which our fancy cottage had been erected and under the damp cast upon my feelings i consoled myself with moralising on the folly of hasty decisions in matters of importance and the necessity of having at least one year's knowledge of a place before you realise airy suggestions in solid stone <\s>
<s> saturday november 10th at the breakfast table tidings reached us of the death of lord nelson and of the victory at trafalgar <\s>
<s> sequestered as we were from the sympathy of a crowd we were shocked to hear that the bells had been ringing joyously at penrith to celebrate the triumph <\s>
<s> in the rebellion of the year 1745 people fled with their valuables from the open country to patterdale as a place of refuge secure from the incursions of strangers <\s>
<s> at that time news such as we had heard might have been long in penetrating so far into the recesses of the mountains but now as you know the approach is easy and the communication in summer time almost hourly nor is this strange for travellers after pleasure are become not less active and more numerous than those who formerly left their homes for purposes of gain <\s>
<s> the priest on the banks of the remotest stream of lapland will talk familiarly of buonaparte's last conquests and discuss the progress of the french revolution having acquired much of his information from adventurers impelled by curiosity alone <\s>
<s> the morning was clear and cheerful after a night of sharp frost <\s>
<s> at 10 o'clock we took our way on foot towards pooley bridge on the same side of the lake we had coasted in a boat the day before looked backwards to the south from our favourite station above blowick <\s>
<s> the dazzling sunbeams striking upon the church and village while the earth was steaming with exhalations not traceable in other quarters rendered their forms even more indistinct than the partial and flitting veil of unillumined vapour had done two days before <\s>
<s> the grass on which we trod and the trees in every thicket were dripping with melted hoar frost <\s>
<s> we observed the lemon coloured leaves of the birches as the breeze turned them to the sun sparkle or rather flash like diamonds and the leafless purple twigs were tipped with globes of shining crystal <\s>
<s> the day continued delightful and unclouded to the end <\s>
<s> i will not describe the country which we slowly travelled through nor relate our adventures and will only add that on the afternoon of the 13th we returned along the banks of ullswater by the usual road <\s>
<s> the lake lay in deep repose after the agitations of a wet and stormy morning <\s>
<s> the trees in gowbarrow park were in that state when what is gained by the disclosure of their bark and branches compensates almost for the loss of foliage exhibiting the variety which characterises the point of time between autumn and winter <\s>
<s> the hawthorns were leafless their round heads covered with rich scarlet berries and adorned with arches of green brambles and eglantines hung with glossy hips and the grey trunks of some of the ancient oaks which in the summer season might have been regarded only for their venerable majesty now attracted notice by a pretty embellishment of green mosses and fern intermixed with russet leaves retained by those slender outstarting twigs which the veteran tree would not have tolerated in his strength <\s>
<s> the smooth silver branches of the ashes were bare most of the alders as green as the devonshire cottage myrtle that weathers the snows of christmas will you accept it as some apology for my having dwelt so long on the woodland ornaments of these scenes that artists speak of the trees on the banks of ullswater and especially along the bays of stybarrow crags as having a peculiar character of picturesque intricacy in their stems and branches which their rocky stations and the mountain winds have combined to give them <\s>
<s> at the end of gowbarrow park a large herd of deer were either moving slowly or standing still among the fern <\s>
<s> i was sorry when a chance companion who had joined us by the way startled them with a whistle disturbing an image of grave simplicity and thoughtful enjoyment for i could have fancied that those natives of this wild and beautiful region were partaking with us a sensation of the solemnity of the closing day <\s>
<s> the sun had been set some time and we could perceive that the light was fading away from the coves of helvellyn but the lake under a luminous sky was more brilliant than before <\s>
<s> after tea at patterdale set out again a fine evening the seven stars close to the mountain top all the stars seemed brighter than usual <\s>
<s> the steeps were reflected in brotherswater and above the lake appeared like enormous black perpendicular walls <\s>
<s> the kirkstone torrents had been swoln by the rains and now filled the mountain pass with their roaring which added greatly to the solemnity of our walk <\s>
<s> behind us when we had climbed to a great height we saw one light very distinct in the vale like a large red star a solitary one in the gloomy region <\s>
<s> the cheerfulness of the scene was in the sky above us <\s>
<s> reached home a little before midnight <\s>

<s> the pass of kirkstone <\s>
<s> within the mind strong fancies work a deep delight the bosom thrills oft as i pass along the fork of these fraternal hills where save the rugged road we find no appanage of human kind nor hint of man if stone or rock seem not his handy work to mock by something cognizably shaped mockery or model roughly hewn and left as if by earthquake strewn or from the flood escaped altars for druid service fit but where no fire was ever lit unless the glow worm to the skies thence offer nightly sacrifice ;) wrinkled egyptian monument green moss grown tower or hoary tent tents of a camp that never shall be raised on which four thousand years have gazed <\s>

<s> they saw adventurously impelled and older eyes than theirs beheld this block and yon whose church like frame gives to the savage pass its name <\s>
<s> that lov'st to hide thy daring in a vapoury bourn not seldom may the hour return when thou shalt be my guide and i as often we find cause when life is at a weary pause and we have panted up the hill of duty with reluctant will be thankful even though tired and faint for the rich bounties of constraint whence oft invigorating transports flow that choice lacked courage to bestow <\s>
<s> my soul was grateful for delight that wore a threatening brow a veil is lifted can she slight the scene that opens now <\s>
<s> though habitation none appear the greenness tells man must be there the shelter that the perspective is of the clime in which we live where toil pursues his daily round where pity sheds sweet tears and love in woodbine bower or birchen grove inflicts his tender wound <\s>
<s> who comes not hither ne'er shall know how beautiful the world below nor can he guess how lightly leaps the brook adown the rocky steeps <\s>

<s> the smooth silver branches of the ashes were bare most of the alders as green as the devonshire cottage myrtle that weathers the snows of christmas will you accept it as some apology for my having dwelt so long on the woodland ornaments of these scenes that artists speak of the trees on the banks of ullswater and especially along the bays of stybarrow crags as having a peculiar character of picturesque intricacy in their stems and branches which their rocky stations and the mountain winds have combined to give them <\s>
<s> at the end of gowbarrow park a large herd of deer were either moving slowly or standing still among the fern <\s>
<s> i was sorry when a chance companion who had joined us by the way startled them with a whistle disturbing an image of grave simplicity and thoughtful enjoyment for i could have fancied that those natives of this wild and beautiful region were partaking with us a sensation of the solemnity of the closing day <\s>

<s> the good woman treated us with oaten cake new and crisp and after this welcome refreshment and rest we proceeded on our return to patterdale by a short cut over the mountains <\s>
<s> on leaving the fields of sandwyke while ascending by a gentle slope along the valley of martindale we had occasion to observe that in thinly peopled glens of this character the general want of wood gives a peculiar interest to the scattered cottages embowered in sycamore <\s>
<s> towards its head this valley splits into two parts and in one of these that to the left there is no house nor any building to be seen but a cattle shed on the side of a hill which is sprinkled over with trees evidently the remains of an extensive forest <\s>
<s> near the entrance of the other division stands the house where we were entertained and beyond the enclosures of that farm there are no other <\s>
<s> a few old trees remain relics of the forest a little stream hastens though with serpentine windings through the uncultivated hollow where many cattle were pasturing <\s>
<s> the cattle of this country are generally white or light coloured but these were dark brown or black which heightened the resemblance this scene bears to many parts of the highlands of scotland while we paused to rest upon the hill side though well contented with the quiet every day sounds the lowing of cattle bleating of sheep and the very gentle murmuring of the valley stream we could not but think what a grand effect the music of the bugle horn would have among these mountains <\s>
<s> it is still heard once every year at the chase i have spoken of a day of festivity for the inhabitants of this district except the poor deer the most ancient of them all <\s>
<s> our ascent even to the top was very easy when it was accomplished we had exceedingly fine views some of the lofty fells being resplendent with sunshine and others partly shrouded by clouds <\s>
<s> ullswater bordered by black steeps was of dazzling brightness the plain beyond penrith smooth and bright or rather gleamy as the sea or sea sands <\s>
<s> looked down into boardale which like stybarrow has been named from the wild swine that formerly abounded here but it has now no sylvan covert being smooth and bare a long narrow deep cradle shaped glen lying so sheltered that one would be pleased to see it planted by human hands there being a sufficiency of soil and the trees would be sheltered almost like shrubs in a green house after having walked some way along the top of the hill came in view of glenriddin and the mountains at the head of grisdale before we began to descend turned aside to a small ruin called at this day the chapel where it is said the inhabitants of martindale and patterdale were accustomed to assemble for worship <\s>
<s> there are now no traces from which you could infer for what use the building had been erected the loose stones and the few which yet continue piled up resemble those which lie elsewhere on the mountain but the shape of the building having been oblong its remains differ from those of a common sheep fold and it has stood east and west <\s>
<s> scarcely did the druids when they fled to these fastnesses perform their rites in any situation more exposed to disturbance from the elements <\s>
<s> one cannot pass by without being reminded that the rustic psalmody must have had the accompaniment of many a wildly whistling blast and what dismal storms must have often drowned the voice of the preacher <\s>
<s> as we descend patterdale opens upon the eye in grand simplicity screened by mountains and proceeding from two heads deep dale and hartshope where lies the little lake of brotherswater named in old maps broaderwater and probably rightly so for bassenthwaite mere at this day is familiarly called broadwater but the change in the appellation of this small lake or pool if it be a corruption may have been assisted by some melancholy accident similar to what happened about twenty years ago when two brothers were drowned there having gone out to take their holiday pleasure upon the ice on a new year's day <\s>
<s> a rough and precipitous peat track brought us down to our friend's house another fine moonlight night but a thick fog rising from the neighbouring river enveloped the rocky and wood crested knoll on which our fancy cottage had been erected and under the damp cast upon my feelings i consoled myself with moralising on the folly of hasty decisions in matters of importance and the necessity of having at least one year's knowledge of a place before you realise airy suggestions in solid stone <\s>
<s> saturday november 10th at the breakfast table tidings reached us of the death of lord nelson and of the victory at trafalgar <\s>
<s> sequestered as we were from the sympathy of a crowd we were shocked to hear that the bells had been ringing joyously at penrith to celebrate the triumph <\s>
<s> in the rebellion of the year 1745 people fled with their valuables from the open country to patterdale as a place of refuge secure from the incursions of strangers <\s>
<s> at that time news such as we had heard might have been long in penetrating so far into the recesses of the mountains but now as you know the approach is easy and the communication in summer time almost hourly nor is this strange for travellers after pleasure are become not less active and more numerous than those who formerly left their homes for purposes of gain <\s>
<s> the priest on the banks of the remotest stream of lapland will talk familiarly of buonaparte's last conquests and discuss the progress of the french revolution having acquired much of his information from adventurers impelled by curiosity alone <\s>

<s> the room is fitted up in the sportsman's style with a cupboard for bottles and glasses with strong chairs and a dining table and ornamented with the horns of the stags caught at these hunts for a succession of years the length of the last race each had run being recorded under his spreading antlers <\s>
<s> the good woman treated us with oaten cake new and crisp and after this welcome refreshment and rest we proceeded on our return to patterdale by a short cut over the mountains <\s>
<s> on leaving the fields of sandwyke while ascending by a gentle slope along the valley of martindale we had occasion to observe that in thinly peopled glens of this character the general want of wood gives a peculiar interest to the scattered cottages embowered in sycamore <\s>
<s> towards its head this valley splits into two parts and in one of these that to the left there is no house nor any building to be seen but a cattle shed on the side of a hill which is sprinkled over with trees evidently the remains of an extensive forest <\s>
<s> near the entrance of the other division stands the house where we were entertained and beyond the enclosures of that farm there are no other <\s>
<s> a few old trees remain relics of the forest a little stream hastens though with serpentine windings through the uncultivated hollow where many cattle were pasturing <\s>
<s> the cattle of this country are generally white or light coloured but these were dark brown or black which heightened the resemblance this scene bears to many parts of the highlands of scotland while we paused to rest upon the hill side though well contented with the quiet every day sounds the lowing of cattle bleating of sheep and the very gentle murmuring of the valley stream we could not but think what a grand effect the music of the bugle horn would have among these mountains <\s>
<s> it is still heard once every year at the chase i have spoken of a day of festivity for the inhabitants of this district except the poor deer the most ancient of them all <\s>
<s> our ascent even to the top was very easy when it was accomplished we had exceedingly fine views some of the lofty fells being resplendent with sunshine and others partly shrouded by clouds <\s>
<s> ullswater bordered by black steeps was of dazzling brightness the plain beyond penrith smooth and bright or rather gleamy as the sea or sea sands <\s>
<s> looked down into boardale which like stybarrow has been named from the wild swine that formerly abounded here but it has now no sylvan covert being smooth and bare a long narrow deep cradle shaped glen lying so sheltered that one would be pleased to see it planted by human hands there being a sufficiency of soil and the trees would be sheltered almost like shrubs in a green house after having walked some way along the top of the hill came in view of glenriddin and the mountains at the head of grisdale before we began to descend turned aside to a small ruin called at this day the chapel where it is said the inhabitants of martindale and patterdale were accustomed to assemble for worship <\s>
<s> there are now no traces from which you could infer for what use the building had been erected the loose stones and the few which yet continue piled up resemble those which lie elsewhere on the mountain but the shape of the building having been oblong its remains differ from those of a common sheep fold and it has stood east and west <\s>
<s> scarcely did the druids when they fled to these fastnesses perform their rites in any situation more exposed to disturbance from the elements <\s>
<s> one cannot pass by without being reminded that the rustic psalmody must have had the accompaniment of many a wildly whistling blast and what dismal storms must have often drowned the voice of the preacher <\s>
<s> as we descend patterdale opens upon the eye in grand simplicity screened by mountains and proceeding from two heads deep dale and hartshope where lies the little lake of brotherswater named in old maps broaderwater and probably rightly so for bassenthwaite mere at this day is familiarly called broadwater but the change in the appellation of this small lake or pool if it be a corruption may have been assisted by some melancholy accident similar to what happened about twenty years ago when two brothers were drowned there having gone out to take their holiday pleasure upon the ice on a new year's day <\s>
<s> a rough and precipitous peat track brought us down to our friend's house another fine moonlight night but a thick fog rising from the neighbouring river enveloped the rocky and wood crested knoll on which our fancy cottage had been erected and under the damp cast upon my feelings i consoled myself with moralising on the folly of hasty decisions in matters of importance and the necessity of having at least one year's knowledge of a place before you realise airy suggestions in solid stone <\s>
<s> saturday november 10th at the breakfast table tidings reached us of the death of lord nelson and of the victory at trafalgar <\s>
<s> sequestered as we were from the sympathy of a crowd we were shocked to hear that the bells had been ringing joyously at penrith to celebrate the triumph <\s>
<s> in the rebellion of the year 1745 people fled with their valuables from the open country to patterdale as a place of refuge secure from the incursions of strangers <\s>
<s> at that time news such as we had heard might have been long in penetrating so far into the recesses of the mountains but now as you know the approach is easy and the communication in summer time almost hourly nor is this strange for travellers after pleasure are become not less active and more numerous than those who formerly left their homes for purposes of gain <\s>
<s> the priest on the banks of the remotest stream of lapland will talk familiarly of buonaparte's last conquests and discuss the progress of the french revolution having acquired much of his information from adventurers impelled by curiosity alone <\s>
<s> the morning was clear and cheerful after a night of sharp frost <\s>
<s> at 10 o'clock we took our way on foot towards pooley bridge on the same side of the lake we had coasted in a boat the day before looked backwards to the south from our favourite station above blowick <\s>
<s> the dazzling sunbeams striking upon the church and village while the earth was steaming with exhalations not traceable in other quarters rendered their forms even more indistinct than the partial and flitting veil of unillumined vapour had done two days before <\s>
<s> the grass on which we trod and the trees in every thicket were dripping with melted hoar frost <\s>
<s> we observed the lemon coloured leaves of the birches as the breeze turned them to the sun sparkle or rather flash like diamonds and the leafless purple twigs were tipped with globes of shining crystal <\s>
<s> the day continued delightful and unclouded to the end <\s>
<s> i will not describe the country which we slowly travelled through nor relate our adventures and will only add that on the afternoon of the 13th we returned along the banks of ullswater by the usual road <\s>
<s> the lake lay in deep repose after the agitations of a wet and stormy morning <\s>
<s> the trees in gowbarrow park were in that state when what is gained by the disclosure of their bark and branches compensates almost for the loss of foliage exhibiting the variety which characterises the point of time between autumn and winter <\s>
<s> the hawthorns were leafless their round heads covered with rich scarlet berries and adorned with arches of green brambles and eglantines hung with glossy hips and the grey trunks of some of the ancient oaks which in the summer season might have been regarded only for their venerable majesty now attracted notice by a pretty embellishment of green mosses and fern intermixed with russet leaves retained by those slender outstarting twigs which the veteran tree would not have tolerated in his strength <\s>
<s> the smooth silver branches of the ashes were bare most of the alders as green as the devonshire cottage myrtle that weathers the snows of christmas will you accept it as some apology for my having dwelt so long on the woodland ornaments of these scenes that artists speak of the trees on the banks of ullswater and especially along the bays of stybarrow crags as having a peculiar character of picturesque intricacy in their stems and branches which their rocky stations and the mountain winds have combined to give them <\s>
<s> at the end of gowbarrow park a large herd of deer were either moving slowly or standing still among the fern <\s>
<s> i was sorry when a chance companion who had joined us by the way startled them with a whistle disturbing an image of grave simplicity and thoughtful enjoyment for i could have fancied that those natives of this wild and beautiful region were partaking with us a sensation of the solemnity of the closing day <\s>
<s> the sun had been set some time and we could perceive that the light was fading away from the coves of helvellyn but the lake under a luminous sky was more brilliant than before <\s>
<s> after tea at patterdale set out again a fine evening the seven stars close to the mountain top all the stars seemed brighter than usual <\s>
<s> the steeps were reflected in brotherswater and above the lake appeared like enormous black perpendicular walls <\s>
<s> the kirkstone torrents had been swoln by the rains and now filled the mountain pass with their roaring which added greatly to the solemnity of our walk <\s>
<s> behind us when we had climbed to a great height we saw one light very distinct in the vale like a large red star a solitary one in the gloomy region <\s>
<s> the cheerfulness of the scene was in the sky above us <\s>

<s> on leaving the fields of sandwyke while ascending by a gentle slope along the valley of martindale we had occasion to observe that in thinly peopled glens of this character the general want of wood gives a peculiar interest to the scattered cottages embowered in sycamore <\s>
<s> towards its head this valley splits into two parts and in one of these that to the left there is no house nor any building to be seen but a cattle shed on the side of a hill which is sprinkled over with trees evidently the remains of an extensive forest <\s>

<s> a few old trees remain relics of the forest a little stream hastens though with serpentine windings through the uncultivated hollow where many cattle were pasturing <\s>
<s> the cattle of this country are generally white or light coloured but these were dark brown or black which heightened the resemblance this scene bears to many parts of the highlands of scotland while we paused to rest upon the hill side though well contented with the quiet every day sounds the lowing of cattle bleating of sheep and the very gentle murmuring of the valley stream we could not but think what a grand effect the music of the bugle horn would have among these mountains <\s>
<s> it is still heard once every year at the chase i have spoken of a day of festivity for the inhabitants of this district except the poor deer the most ancient of them all <\s>
<s> our ascent even to the top was very easy when it was accomplished we had exceedingly fine views some of the lofty fells being resplendent with sunshine and others partly shrouded by clouds <\s>
<s> ullswater bordered by black steeps was of dazzling brightness the plain beyond penrith smooth and bright or rather gleamy as the sea or sea sands <\s>
<s> looked down into boardale which like stybarrow has been named from the wild swine that formerly abounded here but it has now no sylvan covert being smooth and bare a long narrow deep cradle shaped glen lying so sheltered that one would be pleased to see it planted by human hands there being a sufficiency of soil and the trees would be sheltered almost like shrubs in a green house after having walked some way along the top of the hill came in view of glenriddin and the mountains at the head of grisdale before we began to descend turned aside to a small ruin called at this day the chapel where it is said the inhabitants of martindale and patterdale were accustomed to assemble for worship <\s>
<s> there are now no traces from which you could infer for what use the building had been erected the loose stones and the few which yet continue piled up resemble those which lie elsewhere on the mountain but the shape of the building having been oblong its remains differ from those of a common sheep fold and it has stood east and west <\s>
<s> scarcely did the druids when they fled to these fastnesses perform their rites in any situation more exposed to disturbance from the elements <\s>
<s> one cannot pass by without being reminded that the rustic psalmody must have had the accompaniment of many a wildly whistling blast and what dismal storms must have often drowned the voice of the preacher <\s>
<s> as we descend patterdale opens upon the eye in grand simplicity screened by mountains and proceeding from two heads deep dale and hartshope where lies the little lake of brotherswater named in old maps broaderwater and probably rightly so for bassenthwaite mere at this day is familiarly called broadwater but the change in the appellation of this small lake or pool if it be a corruption may have been assisted by some melancholy accident similar to what happened about twenty years ago when two brothers were drowned there having gone out to take their holiday pleasure upon the ice on a new year's day <\s>
<s> a rough and precipitous peat track brought us down to our friend's house another fine moonlight night but a thick fog rising from the neighbouring river enveloped the rocky and wood crested knoll on which our fancy cottage had been erected and under the damp cast upon my feelings i consoled myself with moralising on the folly of hasty decisions in matters of importance and the necessity of having at least one year's knowledge of a place before you realise airy suggestions in solid stone <\s>
<s> saturday november 10th at the breakfast table tidings reached us of the death of lord nelson and of the victory at trafalgar <\s>
<s> sequestered as we were from the sympathy of a crowd we were shocked to hear that the bells had been ringing joyously at penrith to celebrate the triumph <\s>
<s> in the rebellion of the year 1745 people fled with their valuables from the open country to patterdale as a place of refuge secure from the incursions of strangers <\s>
<s> at that time news such as we had heard might have been long in penetrating so far into the recesses of the mountains but now as you know the approach is easy and the communication in summer time almost hourly nor is this strange for travellers after pleasure are become not less active and more numerous than those who formerly left their homes for purposes of gain <\s>
<s> the priest on the banks of the remotest stream of lapland will talk familiarly of buonaparte's last conquests and discuss the progress of the french revolution having acquired much of his information from adventurers impelled by curiosity alone <\s>
<s> the morning was clear and cheerful after a night of sharp frost <\s>
<s> at 10 o'clock we took our way on foot towards pooley bridge on the same side of the lake we had coasted in a boat the day before looked backwards to the south from our favourite station above blowick <\s>
<s> the dazzling sunbeams striking upon the church and village while the earth was steaming with exhalations not traceable in other quarters rendered their forms even more indistinct than the partial and flitting veil of unillumined vapour had done two days before <\s>
<s> the grass on which we trod and the trees in every thicket were dripping with melted hoar frost <\s>
<s> we observed the lemon coloured leaves of the birches as the breeze turned them to the sun sparkle or rather flash like diamonds and the leafless purple twigs were tipped with globes of shining crystal <\s>
<s> the day continued delightful and unclouded to the end <\s>
<s> i will not describe the country which we slowly travelled through nor relate our adventures and will only add that on the afternoon of the 13th we returned along the banks of ullswater by the usual road <\s>
<s> the lake lay in deep repose after the agitations of a wet and stormy morning <\s>
<s> the trees in gowbarrow park were in that state when what is gained by the disclosure of their bark and branches compensates almost for the loss of foliage exhibiting the variety which characterises the point of time between autumn and winter <\s>
<s> the hawthorns were leafless their round heads covered with rich scarlet berries and adorned with arches of green brambles and eglantines hung with glossy hips and the grey trunks of some of the ancient oaks which in the summer season might have been regarded only for their venerable majesty now attracted notice by a pretty embellishment of green mosses and fern intermixed with russet leaves retained by those slender outstarting twigs which the veteran tree would not have tolerated in his strength <\s>
<s> the smooth silver branches of the ashes were bare most of the alders as green as the devonshire cottage myrtle that weathers the snows of christmas will you accept it as some apology for my having dwelt so long on the woodland ornaments of these scenes that artists speak of the trees on the banks of ullswater and especially along the bays of stybarrow crags as having a peculiar character of picturesque intricacy in their stems and branches which their rocky stations and the mountain winds have combined to give them <\s>
<s> at the end of gowbarrow park a large herd of deer were either moving slowly or standing still among the fern <\s>
<s> i was sorry when a chance companion who had joined us by the way startled them with a whistle disturbing an image of grave simplicity and thoughtful enjoyment for i could have fancied that those natives of this wild and beautiful region were partaking with us a sensation of the solemnity of the closing day <\s>
<s> the sun had been set some time and we could perceive that the light was fading away from the coves of helvellyn but the lake under a luminous sky was more brilliant than before <\s>
<s> after tea at patterdale set out again a fine evening the seven stars close to the mountain top all the stars seemed brighter than usual <\s>
<s> the steeps were reflected in brotherswater and above the lake appeared like enormous black perpendicular walls <\s>
<s> the kirkstone torrents had been swoln by the rains and now filled the mountain pass with their roaring which added greatly to the solemnity of our walk <\s>
<s> behind us when we had climbed to a great height we saw one light very distinct in the vale like a large red star a solitary one in the gloomy region <\s>
<s> the cheerfulness of the scene was in the sky above us <\s>
<s> reached home a little before midnight <\s>

<s> the pass of kirkstone <\s>
<s> within the mind strong fancies work a deep delight the bosom thrills oft as i pass along the fork of these fraternal hills where save the rugged road we find no appanage of human kind nor hint of man if stone or rock seem not his handy work to mock by something cognizably shaped mockery or model roughly hewn and left as if by earthquake strewn or from the flood escaped altars for druid service fit but where no fire was ever lit unless the glow worm to the skies thence offer nightly sacrifice ;) wrinkled egyptian monument green moss grown tower or hoary tent tents of a camp that never shall be raised on which four thousand years have gazed <\s>

<s> they saw adventurously impelled and older eyes than theirs beheld this block and yon whose church like frame gives to the savage pass its name <\s>
<s> that lov'st to hide thy daring in a vapoury bourn not seldom may the hour return when thou shalt be my guide and i as often we find cause when life is at a weary pause and we have panted up the hill of duty with reluctant will be thankful even though tired and faint for the rich bounties of constraint whence oft invigorating transports flow that choice lacked courage to bestow <\s>
<s> my soul was grateful for delight that wore a threatening brow a veil is lifted can she slight the scene that opens now <\s>
<s> though habitation none appear the greenness tells man must be there the shelter that the perspective is of the clime in which we live where toil pursues his daily round where pity sheds sweet tears and love in woodbine bower or birchen grove inflicts his tender wound <\s>
<s> who comes not hither ne'er shall know how beautiful the world below nor can he guess how lightly leaps the brook adown the rocky steeps <\s>

<s> the smooth silver branches of the ashes were bare most of the alders as green as the devonshire cottage myrtle that weathers the snows of christmas will you accept it as some apology for my having dwelt so long on the woodland ornaments of these scenes that artists speak of the trees on the banks of ullswater and especially along the bays of stybarrow crags as having a peculiar character of picturesque intricacy in their stems and branches which their rocky stations and the mountain winds have combined to give them <\s>
<s> at the end of gowbarrow park a large herd of deer were either moving slowly or standing still among the fern <\s>
<s> i was sorry when a chance companion who had joined us by the way startled them with a whistle disturbing an image of grave simplicity and thoughtful enjoyment for i could have fancied that those natives of this wild and beautiful region were partaking with us a sensation of the solemnity of the closing day <\s>

<s> the good woman treated us with oaten cake new and crisp and after this welcome refreshment and rest we proceeded on our return to patterdale by a short cut over the mountains <\s>
<s> on leaving the fields of sandwyke while ascending by a gentle slope along the valley of martindale we had occasion to observe that in thinly peopled glens of this character the general want of wood gives a peculiar interest to the scattered cottages embowered in sycamore <\s>
<s> towards its head this valley splits into two parts and in one of these that to the left there is no house nor any building to be seen but a cattle shed on the side of a hill which is sprinkled over with trees evidently the remains of an extensive forest <\s>
<s> near the entrance of the other division stands the house where we were entertained and beyond the enclosures of that farm there are no other <\s>
<s> a few old trees remain relics of the forest a little stream hastens though with serpentine windings through the uncultivated hollow where many cattle were pasturing <\s>
<s> the cattle of this country are generally white or light coloured but these were dark brown or black which heightened the resemblance this scene bears to many parts of the highlands of scotland while we paused to rest upon the hill side though well contented with the quiet every day sounds the lowing of cattle bleating of sheep and the very gentle murmuring of the valley stream we could not but think what a grand effect the music of the bugle horn would have among these mountains <\s>
<s> it is still heard once every year at the chase i have spoken of a day of festivity for the inhabitants of this district except the poor deer the most ancient of them all <\s>
<s> our ascent even to the top was very easy when it was accomplished we had exceedingly fine views some of the lofty fells being resplendent with sunshine and others partly shrouded by clouds <\s>
<s> ullswater bordered by black steeps was of dazzling brightness the plain beyond penrith smooth and bright or rather gleamy as the sea or sea sands <\s>
<s> looked down into boardale which like stybarrow has been named from the wild swine that formerly abounded here but it has now no sylvan covert being smooth and bare a long narrow deep cradle shaped glen lying so sheltered that one would be pleased to see it planted by human hands there being a sufficiency of soil and the trees would be sheltered almost like shrubs in a green house after having walked some way along the top of the hill came in view of glenriddin and the mountains at the head of grisdale before we began to descend turned aside to a small ruin called at this day the chapel where it is said the inhabitants of martindale and patterdale were accustomed to assemble for worship <\s>
<s> there are now no traces from which you could infer for what use the building had been erected the loose stones and the few which yet continue piled up resemble those which lie elsewhere on the mountain but the shape of the building having been oblong its remains differ from those of a common sheep fold and it has stood east and west <\s>
<s> scarcely did the druids when they fled to these fastnesses perform their rites in any situation more exposed to disturbance from the elements <\s>
<s> one cannot pass by without being reminded that the rustic psalmody must have had the accompaniment of many a wildly whistling blast and what dismal storms must have often drowned the voice of the preacher <\s>
<s> as we descend patterdale opens upon the eye in grand simplicity screened by mountains and proceeding from two heads deep dale and hartshope where lies the little lake of brotherswater named in old maps broaderwater and probably rightly so for bassenthwaite mere at this day is familiarly called broadwater but the change in the appellation of this small lake or pool if it be a corruption may have been assisted by some melancholy accident similar to what happened about twenty years ago when two brothers were drowned there having gone out to take their holiday pleasure upon the ice on a new year's day <\s>
<s> a rough and precipitous peat track brought us down to our friend's house another fine moonlight night but a thick fog rising from the neighbouring river enveloped the rocky and wood crested knoll on which our fancy cottage had been erected and under the damp cast upon my feelings i consoled myself with moralising on the folly of hasty decisions in matters of importance and the necessity of having at least one year's knowledge of a place before you realise airy suggestions in solid stone <\s>
<s> saturday november 10th at the breakfast table tidings reached us of the death of lord nelson and of the victory at trafalgar <\s>
<s> sequestered as we were from the sympathy of a crowd we were shocked to hear that the bells had been ringing joyously at penrith to celebrate the triumph <\s>
<s> in the rebellion of the year 1745 people fled with their valuables from the open country to patterdale as a place of refuge secure from the incursions of strangers <\s>
<s> at that time news such as we had heard might have been long in penetrating so far into the recesses of the mountains but now as you know the approach is easy and the communication in summer time almost hourly nor is this strange for travellers after pleasure are become not less active and more numerous than those who formerly left their homes for purposes of gain <\s>
<s> the priest on the banks of the remotest stream of lapland will talk familiarly of buonaparte's last conquests and discuss the progress of the french revolution having acquired much of his information from adventurers impelled by curiosity alone <\s>

<s> the room is fitted up in the sportsman's style with a cupboard for bottles and glasses with strong chairs and a dining table and ornamented with the horns of the stags caught at these hunts for a succession of years the length of the last race each had run being recorded under his spreading antlers <\s>
<s> the good woman treated us with oaten cake new and crisp and after this welcome refreshment and rest we proceeded on our return to patterdale by a short cut over the mountains <\s>
<s> on leaving the fields of sandwyke while ascending by a gentle slope along the valley of martindale we had occasion to observe that in thinly peopled glens of this character the general want of wood gives a peculiar interest to the scattered cottages embowered in sycamore <\s>
<s> towards its head this valley splits into two parts and in one of these that to the left there is no house nor any building to be seen but a cattle shed on the side of a hill which is sprinkled over with trees evidently the remains of an extensive forest <\s>
<s> near the entrance of the other division stands the house where we were entertained and beyond the enclosures of that farm there are no other <\s>
<s> a few old trees remain relics of the forest a little stream hastens though with serpentine windings through the uncultivated hollow where many cattle were pasturing <\s>
<s> the cattle of this country are generally white or light coloured but these were dark brown or black which heightened the resemblance this scene bears to many parts of the highlands of scotland while we paused to rest upon the hill side though well contented with the quiet every day sounds the lowing of cattle bleating of sheep and the very gentle murmuring of the valley stream we could not but think what a grand effect the music of the bugle horn would have among these mountains <\s>
<s> it is still heard once every year at the chase i have spoken of a day of festivity for the inhabitants of this district except the poor deer the most ancient of them all <\s>
<s> our ascent even to the top was very easy when it was accomplished we had exceedingly fine views some of the lofty fells being resplendent with sunshine and others partly shrouded by clouds <\s>
<s> ullswater bordered by black steeps was of dazzling brightness the plain beyond penrith smooth and bright or rather gleamy as the sea or sea sands <\s>
<s> looked down into boardale which like stybarrow has been named from the wild swine that formerly abounded here but it has now no sylvan covert being smooth and bare a long narrow deep cradle shaped glen lying so sheltered that one would be pleased to see it planted by human hands there being a sufficiency of soil and the trees would be sheltered almost like shrubs in a green house after having walked some way along the top of the hill came in view of glenriddin and the mountains at the head of grisdale before we began to descend turned aside to a small ruin called at this day the chapel where it is said the inhabitants of martindale and patterdale were accustomed to assemble for worship <\s>
<s> there are now no traces from which you could infer for what use the building had been erected the loose stones and the few which yet continue piled up resemble those which lie elsewhere on the mountain but the shape of the building having been oblong its remains differ from those of a common sheep fold and it has stood east and west <\s>
<s> scarcely did the druids when they fled to these fastnesses perform their rites in any situation more exposed to disturbance from the elements <\s>
<s> one cannot pass by without being reminded that the rustic psalmody must have had the accompaniment of many a wildly whistling blast and what dismal storms must have often drowned the voice of the preacher <\s>
<s> as we descend patterdale opens upon the eye in grand simplicity screened by mountains and proceeding from two heads deep dale and hartshope where lies the little lake of brotherswater named in old maps broaderwater and probably rightly so for bassenthwaite mere at this day is familiarly called broadwater but the change in the appellation of this small lake or pool if it be a corruption may have been assisted by some melancholy accident similar to what happened about twenty years ago when two brothers were drowned there having gone out to take their holiday pleasure upon the ice on a new year's day <\s>
<s> a rough and precipitous peat track brought us down to our friend's house another fine moonlight night but a thick fog rising from the neighbouring river enveloped the rocky and wood crested knoll on which our fancy cottage had been erected and under the damp cast upon my feelings i consoled myself with moralising on the folly of hasty decisions in matters of importance and the necessity of having at least one year's knowledge of a place before you realise airy suggestions in solid stone <\s>
<s> saturday november 10th at the breakfast table tidings reached us of the death of lord nelson and of the victory at trafalgar <\s>
<s> sequestered as we were from the sympathy of a crowd we were shocked to hear that the bells had been ringing joyously at penrith to celebrate the triumph <\s>
<s> in the rebellion of the year 1745 people fled with their valuables from the open country to patterdale as a place of refuge secure from the incursions of strangers <\s>
<s> at that time news such as we had heard might have been long in penetrating so far into the recesses of the mountains but now as you know the approach is easy and the communication in summer time almost hourly nor is this strange for travellers after pleasure are become not less active and more numerous than those who formerly left their homes for purposes of gain <\s>
<s> the priest on the banks of the remotest stream of lapland will talk familiarly of buonaparte's last conquests and discuss the progress of the french revolution having acquired much of his information from adventurers impelled by curiosity alone <\s>
<s> the morning was clear and cheerful after a night of sharp frost <\s>
<s> at 10 o'clock we took our way on foot towards pooley bridge on the same side of the lake we had coasted in a boat the day before looked backwards to the south from our favourite station above blowick <\s>
<s> the dazzling sunbeams striking upon the church and village while the earth was steaming with exhalations not traceable in other quarters rendered their forms even more indistinct than the partial and flitting veil of unillumined vapour had done two days before <\s>
<s> the grass on which we trod and the trees in every thicket were dripping with melted hoar frost <\s>
<s> we observed the lemon coloured leaves of the birches as the breeze turned them to the sun sparkle or rather flash like diamonds and the leafless purple twigs were tipped with globes of shining crystal <\s>
<s> the day continued delightful and unclouded to the end <\s>
<s> i will not describe the country which we slowly travelled through nor relate our adventures and will only add that on the afternoon of the 13th we returned along the banks of ullswater by the usual road <\s>
<s> the lake lay in deep repose after the agitations of a wet and stormy morning <\s>
<s> the trees in gowbarrow park were in that state when what is gained by the disclosure of their bark and branches compensates almost for the loss of foliage exhibiting the variety which characterises the point of time between autumn and winter <\s>
<s> the hawthorns were leafless their round heads covered with rich scarlet berries and adorned with arches of green brambles and eglantines hung with glossy hips and the grey trunks of some of the ancient oaks which in the summer season might have been regarded only for their venerable majesty now attracted notice by a pretty embellishment of green mosses and fern intermixed with russet leaves retained by those slender outstarting twigs which the veteran tree would not have tolerated in his strength <\s>
<s> the smooth silver branches of the ashes were bare most of the alders as green as the devonshire cottage myrtle that weathers the snows of christmas will you accept it as some apology for my having dwelt so long on the woodland ornaments of these scenes that artists speak of the trees on the banks of ullswater and especially along the bays of stybarrow crags as having a peculiar character of picturesque intricacy in their stems and branches which their rocky stations and the mountain winds have combined to give them <\s>
<s> at the end of gowbarrow park a large herd of deer were either moving slowly or standing still among the fern <\s>
<s> i was sorry when a chance companion who had joined us by the way startled them with a whistle disturbing an image of grave simplicity and thoughtful enjoyment for i could have fancied that those natives of this wild and beautiful region were partaking with us a sensation of the solemnity of the closing day <\s>
<s> the sun had been set some time and we could perceive that the light was fading away from the coves of helvellyn but the lake under a luminous sky was more brilliant than before <\s>
<s> after tea at patterdale set out again a fine evening the seven stars close to the mountain top all the stars seemed brighter than usual <\s>
<s> the steeps were reflected in brotherswater and above the lake appeared like enormous black perpendicular walls <\s>
<s> the kirkstone torrents had been swoln by the rains and now filled the mountain pass with their roaring which added greatly to the solemnity of our walk <\s>
<s> behind us when we had climbed to a great height we saw one light very distinct in the vale like a large red star a solitary one in the gloomy region <\s>
<s> the cheerfulness of the scene was in the sky above us <\s>

<s> on leaving the fields of sandwyke while ascending by a gentle slope along the valley of martindale we had occasion to observe that in thinly peopled glens of this character the general want of wood gives a peculiar interest to the scattered cottages embowered in sycamore <\s>
<s> towards its head this valley splits into two parts and in one of these that to the left there is no house nor any building to be seen but a cattle shed on the side of a hill which is sprinkled over with trees evidently the remains of an extensive forest <\s>

<s> a few old trees remain relics of the forest a little stream hastens though with serpentine windings through the uncultivated hollow where many cattle were pasturing <\s>
<s> the cattle of this country are generally white or light coloured but these were dark brown or black which heightened the resemblance this scene bears to many parts of the highlands of scotland while we paused to rest upon the hill side though well contented with the quiet every day sounds the lowing of cattle bleating of sheep and the very gentle murmuring of the valley stream we could not but think what a grand effect the music of the bugle horn would have among these mountains <\s>
<s> it is still heard once every year at the chase i have spoken of a day of festivity for the inhabitants of this district except the poor deer the most ancient of them all <\s>
<s> our ascent even to the top was very easy when it was accomplished we had exceedingly fine views some of the lofty fells being resplendent with sunshine and others partly shrouded by clouds <\s>
<s> ullswater bordered by black steeps was of dazzling brightness the plain beyond penrith smooth and bright or rather gleamy as the sea or sea sands <\s>
<s> looked down into boardale which like stybarrow has been named from the wild swine that formerly abounded here but it has now no sylvan covert being smooth and bare a long narrow deep cradle shaped glen lying so sheltered that one would be pleased to see it planted by human hands there being a sufficiency of soil and the trees would be sheltered almost like shrubs in a green house after having walked some way along the top of the hill came in view of glenriddin and the mountains at the head of grisdale before we began to descend turned aside to a small ruin called at this day the chapel where it is said the inhabitants of martindale and patterdale were accustomed to assemble for worship <\s>
<s> there are now no traces from which you could infer for what use the building had been erected the loose stones and the few which yet continue piled up resemble those which lie elsewhere on the mountain but the shape of the building having been oblong its remains differ from those of a common sheep fold and it has stood east and west <\s>
<s> scarcely did the druids when they fled to these fastnesses perform their rites in any situation more exposed to disturbance from the elements <\s>
<s> one cannot pass by without being reminded that the rustic psalmody must have had the accompaniment of many a wildly whistling blast and what dismal storms must have often drowned the voice of the preacher <\s>
<s> as we descend patterdale opens upon the eye in grand simplicity screened by mountains and proceeding from two heads deep dale and hartshope where lies the little lake of brotherswater named in old maps broaderwater and probably rightly so for bassenthwaite mere at this day is familiarly called broadwater but the change in the appellation of this small lake or pool if it be a corruption may have been assisted by some melancholy accident similar to what happened about twenty years ago when two brothers were drowned there having gone out to take their holiday pleasure upon the ice on a new year's day <\s>
<s> a rough and precipitous peat track brought us down to our friend's house another fine moonlight night but a thick fog rising from the neighbouring river enveloped the rocky and wood crested knoll on which our fancy cottage had been erected and under the damp cast upon my feelings i consoled myself with moralising on the folly of hasty decisions in matters of importance and the necessity of having at least one year's knowledge of a place before you realise airy suggestions in solid stone <\s>
<s> saturday november 10th at the breakfast table tidings reached us of the death of lord nelson and of the victory at trafalgar <\s>
<s> sequestered as we were from the sympathy of a crowd we were shocked to hear that the bells had been ringing joyously at penrith to celebrate the triumph <\s>
<s> in the rebellion of the year 1745 people fled with their valuables from the open country to patterdale as a place of refuge secure from the incursions of strangers <\s>
<s> at that time news such as we had heard might have been long in penetrating so far into the recesses of the mountains but now as you know the approach is easy and the communication in summer time almost hourly nor is this strange for travellers after pleasure are become not less active and more numerous than those who formerly left their homes for purposes of gain <\s>
<s> the priest on the banks of the remotest stream of lapland will talk familiarly of buonaparte's last conquests and discuss the progress of the french revolution having acquired much of his information from adventurers impelled by curiosity alone <\s>
<s> the morning was clear and cheerful after a night of sharp frost <\s>
<s> at 10 o'clock we took our way on foot towards pooley bridge on the same side of the lake we had coasted in a boat the day before looked backwards to the south from our favourite station above blowick <\s>
<s> the dazzling sunbeams striking upon the church and village while the earth was steaming with exhalations not traceable in other quarters rendered their forms even more indistinct than the partial and flitting veil of unillumined vapour had done two days before <\s>
<s> the grass on which we trod and the trees in every thicket were dripping with melted hoar frost <\s>
<s> we observed the lemon coloured leaves of the birches as the breeze turned them to the sun sparkle or rather flash like diamonds and the leafless purple twigs were tipped with globes of shining crystal <\s>
<s> the day continued delightful and unclouded to the end <\s>
<s> i will not describe the country which we slowly travelled through nor relate our adventures and will only add that on the afternoon of the 13th we returned along the banks of ullswater by the usual road <\s>
<s> the lake lay in deep repose after the agitations of a wet and stormy morning <\s>
<s> the trees in gowbarrow park were in that state when what is gained by the disclosure of their bark and branches compensates almost for the loss of foliage exhibiting the variety which characterises the point of time between autumn and winter <\s>
<s> the hawthorns were leafless their round heads covered with rich scarlet berries and adorned with arches of green brambles and eglantines hung with glossy hips and the grey trunks of some of the ancient oaks which in the summer season might have been regarded only for their venerable majesty now attracted notice by a pretty embellishment of green mosses and fern intermixed with russet leaves retained by those slender outstarting twigs which the veteran tree would not have tolerated in his strength <\s>
<s> the smooth silver branches of the ashes were bare most of the alders as green as the devonshire cottage myrtle that weathers the snows of christmas will you accept it as some apology for my having dwelt so long on the woodland ornaments of these scenes that artists speak of the trees on the banks of ullswater and especially along the bays of stybarrow crags as having a peculiar character of picturesque intricacy in their stems and branches which their rocky stations and the mountain winds have combined to give them <\s>
<s> at the end of gowbarrow park a large herd of deer were either moving slowly or standing still among the fern <\s>
<s> i was sorry when a chance companion who had joined us by the way startled them with a whistle disturbing an image of grave simplicity and thoughtful enjoyment for i could have fancied that those natives of this wild and beautiful region were partaking with us a sensation of the solemnity of the closing day <\s>
<s> the sun had been set some time and we could perceive that the light was fading away from the coves of helvellyn but the lake under a luminous sky was more brilliant than before <\s>
<s> after tea at patterdale set out again a fine evening the seven stars close to the mountain top all the stars seemed brighter than usual <\s>
<s> the steeps were reflected in brotherswater and above the lake appeared like enormous black perpendicular walls <\s>
<s> the kirkstone torrents had been swoln by the rains and now filled the mountain pass with their roaring which added greatly to the solemnity of our walk <\s>
<s> behind us when we had climbed to a great height we saw one light very distinct in the vale like a large red star a solitary one in the gloomy region <\s>
<s> the cheerfulness of the scene was in the sky above us <\s>
<s> reached home a little before midnight <\s>

<s> the pass of kirkstone <\s>
<s> within the mind strong fancies work a deep delight the bosom thrills oft as i pass along the fork of these fraternal hills where save the rugged road we find no appanage of human kind nor hint of man if stone or rock seem not his handy work to mock by something cognizably shaped mockery or model roughly hewn and left as if by earthquake strewn or from the flood escaped altars for druid service fit but where no fire was ever lit unless the glow worm to the skies thence offer nightly sacrifice ;) wrinkled egyptian monument green moss grown tower or hoary tent tents of a camp that never shall be raised on which four thousand years have gazed <\s>

<s> they saw adventurously impelled and older eyes than theirs beheld this block and yon whose church like frame gives to the savage pass its name <\s>
<s> that lov'st to hide thy daring in a vapoury bourn not seldom may the hour return when thou shalt be my guide and i as often we find cause when life is at a weary pause and we have panted up the hill of duty with reluctant will be thankful even though tired and faint for the rich bounties of constraint whence oft invigorating transports flow that choice lacked courage to bestow <\s>
<s> my soul was grateful for delight that wore a threatening brow a veil is lifted can she slight the scene that opens now <\s>
<s> though habitation none appear the greenness tells man must be there the shelter that the perspective is of the clime in which we live where toil pursues his daily round where pity sheds sweet tears and love in woodbine bower or birchen grove inflicts his tender wound <\s>
<s> who comes not hither ne'er shall know how beautiful the world below nor can he guess how lightly leaps the brook adown the rocky steeps <\s>

<s> the smooth silver branches of the ashes were bare most of the alders as green as the devonshire cottage myrtle that weathers the snows of christmas will you accept it as some apology for my having dwelt so long on the woodland ornaments of these scenes that artists speak of the trees on the banks of ullswater and especially along the bays of stybarrow crags as having a peculiar character of picturesque intricacy in their stems and branches which their rocky stations and the mountain winds have combined to give them <\s>
<s> at the end of gowbarrow park a large herd of deer were either moving slowly or standing still among the fern <\s>
<s> i was sorry when a chance companion who had joined us by the way startled them with a whistle disturbing an image of grave simplicity and thoughtful enjoyment for i could have fancied that those natives of this wild and beautiful region were partaking with us a sensation of the solemnity of the closing day <\s>

<s> the good woman treated us with oaten cake new and crisp and after this welcome refreshment and rest we proceeded on our return to patterdale by a short cut over the mountains <\s>
<s> on leaving the fields of sandwyke while ascending by a gentle slope along the valley of martindale we had occasion to observe that in thinly peopled glens of this character the general want of wood gives a peculiar interest to the scattered cottages embowered in sycamore <\s>
<s> towards its head this valley splits into two parts and in one of these that to the left there is no house nor any building to be seen but a cattle shed on the side of a hill which is sprinkled over with trees evidently the remains of an extensive forest <\s>
<s> near the entrance of the other division stands the house where we were entertained and beyond the enclosures of that farm there are no other <\s>
<s> a few old trees remain relics of the forest a little stream hastens though with serpentine windings through the uncultivated hollow where many cattle were pasturing <\s>
<s> the cattle of this country are generally white or light coloured but these were dark brown or black which heightened the resemblance this scene bears to many parts of the highlands of scotland while we paused to rest upon the hill side though well contented with the quiet every day sounds the lowing of cattle bleating of sheep and the very gentle murmuring of the valley stream we could not but think what a grand effect the music of the bugle horn would have among these mountains <\s>
<s> it is still heard once every year at the chase i have spoken of a day of festivity for the inhabitants of this district except the poor deer the most ancient of them all <\s>
<s> our ascent even to the top was very easy when it was accomplished we had exceedingly fine views some of the lofty fells being resplendent with sunshine and others partly shrouded by clouds <\s>
<s> ullswater bordered by black steeps was of dazzling brightness the plain beyond penrith smooth and bright or rather gleamy as the sea or sea sands <\s>
<s> looked down into boardale which like stybarrow has been named from the wild swine that formerly abounded here but it has now no sylvan covert being smooth and bare a long narrow deep cradle shaped glen lying so sheltered that one would be pleased to see it planted by human hands there being a sufficiency of soil and the trees would be sheltered almost like shrubs in a green house after having walked some way along the top of the hill came in view of glenriddin and the mountains at the head of grisdale before we began to descend turned aside to a small ruin called at this day the chapel where it is said the inhabitants of martindale and patterdale were accustomed to assemble for worship <\s>
<s> there are now no traces from which you could infer for what use the building had been erected the loose stones and the few which yet continue piled up resemble those which lie elsewhere on the mountain but the shape of the building having been oblong its remains differ from those of a common sheep fold and it has stood east and west <\s>
<s> scarcely did the druids when they fled to these fastnesses perform their rites in any situation more exposed to disturbance from the elements <\s>
<s> one cannot pass by without being reminded that the rustic psalmody must have had the accompaniment of many a wildly whistling blast and what dismal storms must have often drowned the voice of the preacher <\s>
<s> as we descend patterdale opens upon the eye in grand simplicity screened by mountains and proceeding from two heads deep dale and hartshope where lies the little lake of brotherswater named in old maps broaderwater and probably rightly so for bassenthwaite mere at this day is familiarly called broadwater but the change in the appellation of this small lake or pool if it be a corruption may have been assisted by some melancholy accident similar to what happened about twenty years ago when two brothers were drowned there having gone out to take their holiday pleasure upon the ice on a new year's day <\s>
<s> a rough and precipitous peat track brought us down to our friend's house another fine moonlight night but a thick fog rising from the neighbouring river enveloped the rocky and wood crested knoll on which our fancy cottage had been erected and under the damp cast upon my feelings i consoled myself with moralising on the folly of hasty decisions in matters of importance and the necessity of having at least one year's knowledge of a place before you realise airy suggestions in solid stone <\s>
<s> saturday november 10th at the breakfast table tidings reached us of the death of lord nelson and of the victory at trafalgar <\s>
<s> sequestered as we were from the sympathy of a crowd we were shocked to hear that the bells had been ringing joyously at penrith to celebrate the triumph <\s>
<s> in the rebellion of the year 1745 people fled with their valuables from the open country to patterdale as a place of refuge secure from the incursions of strangers <\s>
<s> at that time news such as we had heard might have been long in penetrating so far into the recesses of the mountains but now as you know the approach is easy and the communication in summer time almost hourly nor is this strange for travellers after pleasure are become not less active and more numerous than those who formerly left their homes for purposes of gain <\s>
<s> the priest on the banks of the remotest stream of lapland will talk familiarly of buonaparte's last conquests and discuss the progress of the french revolution having acquired much of his information from adventurers impelled by curiosity alone <\s>

<s> the room is fitted up in the sportsman's style with a cupboard for bottles and glasses with strong chairs and a dining table and ornamented with the horns of the stags caught at these hunts for a succession of years the length of the last race each had run being recorded under his spreading antlers <\s>
<s> the good woman treated us with oaten cake new and crisp and after this welcome refreshment and rest we proceeded on our return to patterdale by a short cut over the mountains <\s>
<s> on leaving the fields of sandwyke while ascending by a gentle slope along the valley of martindale we had occasion to observe that in thinly peopled glens of this character the general want of wood gives a peculiar interest to the scattered cottages embowered in sycamore <\s>
<s> towards its head this valley splits into two parts and in one of these that to the left there is no house nor any building to be seen but a cattle shed on the side of a hill which is sprinkled over with trees evidently the remains of an extensive forest <\s>
<s> near the entrance of the other division stands the house where we were entertained and beyond the enclosures of that farm there are no other <\s>
<s> a few old trees remain relics of the forest a little stream hastens though with serpentine windings through the uncultivated hollow where many cattle were pasturing <\s>
<s> the cattle of this country are generally white or light coloured but these were dark brown or black which heightened the resemblance this scene bears to many parts of the highlands of scotland while we paused to rest upon the hill side though well contented with the quiet every day sounds the lowing of cattle bleating of sheep and the very gentle murmuring of the valley stream we could not but think what a grand effect the music of the bugle horn would have among these mountains <\s>
<s> it is still heard once every year at the chase i have spoken of a day of festivity for the inhabitants of this district except the poor deer the most ancient of them all <\s>
<s> our ascent even to the top was very easy when it was accomplished we had exceedingly fine views some of the lofty fells being resplendent with sunshine and others partly shrouded by clouds <\s>
<s> ullswater bordered by black steeps was of dazzling brightness the plain beyond penrith smooth and bright or rather gleamy as the sea or sea sands <\s>
<s> looked down into boardale which like stybarrow has been named from the wild swine that formerly abounded here but it has now no sylvan covert being smooth and bare a long narrow deep cradle shaped glen lying so sheltered that one would be pleased to see it planted by human hands there being a sufficiency of soil and the trees would be sheltered almost like shrubs in a green house after having walked some way along the top of the hill came in view of glenriddin and the mountains at the head of grisdale before we began to descend turned aside to a small ruin called at this day the chapel where it is said the inhabitants of martindale and patterdale were accustomed to assemble for worship <\s>
<s> there are now no traces from which you could infer for what use the building had been erected the loose stones and the few which yet continue piled up resemble those which lie elsewhere on the mountain but the shape of the building having been oblong its remains differ from those of a common sheep fold and it has stood east and west <\s>
<s> scarcely did the druids when they fled to these fastnesses perform their rites in any situation more exposed to disturbance from the elements <\s>
<s> one cannot pass by without being reminded that the rustic psalmody must have had the accompaniment of many a wildly whistling blast and what dismal storms must have often drowned the voice of the preacher <\s>
<s> as we descend patterdale opens upon the eye in grand simplicity screened by mountains and proceeding from two heads deep dale and hartshope where lies the little lake of brotherswater named in old maps broaderwater and probably rightly so for bassenthwaite mere at this day is familiarly called broadwater but the change in the appellation of this small lake or pool if it be a corruption may have been assisted by some melancholy accident similar to what happened about twenty years ago when two brothers were drowned there having gone out to take their holiday pleasure upon the ice on a new year's day <\s>
<s> a rough and precipitous peat track brought us down to our friend's house another fine moonlight night but a thick fog rising from the neighbouring river enveloped the rocky and wood crested knoll on which our fancy cottage had been erected and under the damp cast upon my feelings i consoled myself with moralising on the folly of hasty decisions in matters of importance and the necessity of having at least one year's knowledge of a place before you realise airy suggestions in solid stone <\s>
<s> saturday november 10th at the breakfast table tidings reached us of the death of lord nelson and of the victory at trafalgar <\s>
<s> sequestered as we were from the sympathy of a crowd we were shocked to hear that the bells had been ringing joyously at penrith to celebrate the triumph <\s>
<s> in the rebellion of the year 1745 people fled with their valuables from the open country to patterdale as a place of refuge secure from the incursions of strangers <\s>
<s> at that time news such as we had heard might have been long in penetrating so far into the recesses of the mountains but now as you know the approach is easy and the communication in summer time almost hourly nor is this strange for travellers after pleasure are become not less active and more numerous than those who formerly left their homes for purposes of gain <\s>
<s> the priest on the banks of the remotest stream of lapland will talk familiarly of buonaparte's last conquests and discuss the progress of the french revolution having acquired much of his information from adventurers impelled by curiosity alone <\s>
<s> the morning was clear and cheerful after a night of sharp frost <\s>
<s> at 10 o'clock we took our way on foot towards pooley bridge on the same side of the lake we had coasted in a boat the day before looked backwards to the south from our favourite station above blowick <\s>
<s> the dazzling sunbeams striking upon the church and village while the earth was steaming with exhalations not traceable in other quarters rendered their forms even more indistinct than the partial and flitting veil of unillumined vapour had done two days before <\s>
<s> the grass on which we trod and the trees in every thicket were dripping with melted hoar frost <\s>
<s> we observed the lemon coloured leaves of the birches as the breeze turned them to the sun sparkle or rather flash like diamonds and the leafless purple twigs were tipped with globes of shining crystal <\s>
<s> the day continued delightful and unclouded to the end <\s>
<s> i will not describe the country which we slowly travelled through nor relate our adventures and will only add that on the afternoon of the 13th we returned along the banks of ullswater by the usual road <\s>
<s> the lake lay in deep repose after the agitations of a wet and stormy morning <\s>
<s> the trees in gowbarrow park were in that state when what is gained by the disclosure of their bark and branches compensates almost for the loss of foliage exhibiting the variety which characterises the point of time between autumn and winter <\s>
<s> the hawthorns were leafless their round heads covered with rich scarlet berries and adorned with arches of green brambles and eglantines hung with glossy hips and the grey trunks of some of the ancient oaks which in the summer season might have been regarded only for their venerable majesty now attracted notice by a pretty embellishment of green mosses and fern intermixed with russet leaves retained by those slender outstarting twigs which the veteran tree would not have tolerated in his strength <\s>
<s> the smooth silver branches of the ashes were bare most of the alders as green as the devonshire cottage myrtle that weathers the snows of christmas will you accept it as some apology for my having dwelt so long on the woodland ornaments of these scenes that artists speak of the trees on the banks of ullswater and especially along the bays of stybarrow crags as having a peculiar character of picturesque intricacy in their stems and branches which their rocky stations and the mountain winds have combined to give them <\s>
<s> at the end of gowbarrow park a large herd of deer were either moving slowly or standing still among the fern <\s>
<s> i was sorry when a chance companion who had joined us by the way startled them with a whistle disturbing an image of grave simplicity and thoughtful enjoyment for i could have fancied that those natives of this wild and beautiful region were partaking with us a sensation of the solemnity of the closing day <\s>
<s> the sun had been set some time and we could perceive that the light was fading away from the coves of helvellyn but the lake under a luminous sky was more brilliant than before <\s>
<s> after tea at patterdale set out again a fine evening the seven stars close to the mountain top all the stars seemed brighter than usual <\s>
<s> the steeps were reflected in brotherswater and above the lake appeared like enormous black perpendicular walls <\s>
<s> the kirkstone torrents had been swoln by the rains and now filled the mountain pass with their roaring which added greatly to the solemnity of our walk <\s>
<s> behind us when we had climbed to a great height we saw one light very distinct in the vale like a large red star a solitary one in the gloomy region <\s>
<s> the cheerfulness of the scene was in the sky above us <\s>

<s> it happens i believe that the intended railway would pass through this little property and i hope that an apology for the answer will not be thought necessary by one who enters into the strength of the feeling <\s>
<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>
<s> the nuisance was swept away when the late mr <\s>
<s> curwen became the owner of this favoured spot <\s>
<s> english was followed by mr <\s>
<s> pocklington a native of nottinghamshire who played strange pranks by his buildings and plantations upon vicar's island in derwent water which his admiration such as it was of the country and probably a wish to be a leader in a new fashion had tempted him to purchase <\s>
<s> but what has all this to do with the subject why to show that a vivid perception of romantic scenery is neither inherent in mankind nor a necessary consequence of even a comprehensive education <\s>
<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>
<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>
<s> the wall was backed by a bank of earth and was exquisitely decorated with ivy flowers moss and ferns such as grow of themselves in like places but the mere notion of fitness associated with a trim garden wall prevented in this instance all sense of the spontaneous bounty and delicate care of nature <\s>
<s> in the midst of a small pleasure ground immediately below my house rises a detached rock equally remarkable for the beauty of its form the ancient oaks that grow out of it and the flowers and shrubs which adorn it <\s>
<s> what a nice place would this be said a manchester tradesman pointing to the rock if that ugly lump were but out of the way <\s>
<s> men as little advanced in the pleasure which such objects give to others are so far from being rare that they may be said fairly to represent a large majority of mankind <\s>
<s> this is a fact and none but the deceiver and the willingly deceived can be offended by its being stated <\s>
<s> but as a more susceptible taste is undoubtedly a great acquisition and has been spreading among us for some years the question is what means are most likely to be beneficial in extending its operation <\s>
<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>
<s> for further illustration of the subject turn to what we know of a man of extraordinary genius who was bred to hard labour in agricultural employments burns the poet <\s>
<s> when he had become distinguished by the publication of a volume of verses and was enabled to travel by the profit his poems brought him he made a tour in the course of which as his companion dr <\s>
<s> adair tells us he visited scenes inferior to none in scotland in beauty sublimity and romantic interest and the doctor having noticed with other companions that he seemed little moved upon one occasion by the sight of such a scene says 'i doubt if he had much taste for the picturesque <\s>
<s> the personal testimony however upon this point is conflicting but when dr <\s>
<s> currie refers to certain local poems as decisive proofs that burns fellow traveller was mistaken the biographer is surely unfortunate <\s>
<s> how vague and tame are the poet's expressions in those few local poems compared with his language when he is describing objects with which his position in life allowed him to be familiar <\s>
<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>
<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>
<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>
<s> the wide spread waters of these regions are in their nature peaceful so are the steep mountains and the rocky glens nor can they be profitably enjoyed but by a mind disposed to peace <\s>
<s> go to a pantomime a farce or a puppet show if you want noisy pleasure the crowd of spectators who partake your enjoyment will by their presence and acclamations enhance it but may those who have given proof that they prefer other gratifications continue to be safe from the molestation of cheap trains pouring out their hundreds at a time along the margin of windermere nor let any one be liable to the charge of being selfishly disregardful of the poor and their innocent and salutary enjoyments if he does not congratulate himself upon the especial benefit which would thus be conferred on such a concourse <\s>
<s> o nature a thy shows an forms to feeling pensive hearts hae charms <\s>
<s> so exclaimed the ayrshire ploughman speaking of ordinary rural nature under the varying influences of the seasons and the sentiment has found an echo in the bosoms of thousands in as humble a condition as he himself was when he gave vent to it <\s>
<s> but then they were feeling pensive hearts men who would be among the first to lament the facility with which they had approached this region by a sacrifice of so much of its quiet and beauty as from the intrusion of a railway would be inseparable <\s>
<s> what can in truth be more absurd than that either rich or poor should be spared the trouble of travelling by the high roads over so short a space according to their respective means if the unavoidable consequence must be a great disturbance of the retirement and in many places a destruction of the beauty of the country which the parties are come in search of <\s>
<s> would not this be pretty much like the child's cutting up his drum to learn where the sound came from <\s>
<s> having i trust given sufficient reason for the belief that the imperfectly educated classes are not likely to draw much good from rare visits to the lakes performed in this way and surely on their own account it is not desirable that the visits should be frequent let us glance at the mischief which such facilities would certainly produce <\s>
<s> the directors of railway companies are always ready to devise or encourage entertainments for tempting the humbler classes to leave their homes <\s>
<s> accordingly for the profit of the shareholders and that of the lower class of innkeepers we should have wrestling matches horse and boat races without number and pot houses and beer shops would keep pace with these excitements and recreations most of which might too easily be had elsewhere <\s>
<s> the injury which would thus be done to morals both among this influx of strangers and the lower class of inhabitants is obvious and supposing such extraordinary temptations not to be held out there cannot be a doubt that the sabbath day in the towns of bowness and ambleside and other parts of the district would be subject to much additional desecration <\s>
<s> whatever comes of the scheme which we have endeavoured to discountenance the charge against its opponents of being selfishly regardless of the poor ought to cease <\s>
<s> the cry has been raised and kept up by three classes of persons they who wish to bring into discredit all such as stand in the way of their gains or gambling speculations they who are dazzled by the application of physical science to the useful arts and indiscriminately applaud what they call the spirit of the age as manifested in this way and lastly those persons who are ever ready to step forward in what appears to them to be the cause of the poor but not always with becoming attention to particulars <\s>
<s> i am well aware that upon the first class what has been said will be of no avail but upon the two latter some impression will i trust be made <\s>
<s> the railway power we know well will not admit of being materially counteracted by sentiment and who would wish it where large towns are connected and the interests of trade and agriculture are substantially promoted by such mode of intercommunication <\s>
<s> but be it remembered that this case is as has been said before a peculiar one and that the staple of the country is its beauty and its character of retirement <\s>
<s> let then the beauty be undisfigured and the retirement unviolated unless there be reason for believing that rights and interests of a higher kind and more apparent than those which have been urged in behalf of the projected intrusion will compensate the sacrifice <\s>
<s> thanking you for the judicious observations that have appeared in your paper upon the subject of railways i remain sir your obliged wm <\s>
<s> note to the instances named in this letter of the indifference even of men of genius to the sublime forms of nature in mountainous districts the author of the interesting essays in the morning post entitled table talk has justly added goldsmith and i give the passage in his own words <\s>
<s> the simple and gentle hearted goldsmith who had an exquisite sense of rural beauty in the familiar forms of hill and dale and meadows with their hawthorn scented hedges does not seem to have dreamt of any such thing as beauty in the swiss alps though he traversed them on foot and had therefore the best opportunities of observing them <\s>

<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>
<s> the nuisance was swept away when the late mr <\s>
<s> curwen became the owner of this favoured spot <\s>
<s> english was followed by mr <\s>
<s> pocklington a native of nottinghamshire who played strange pranks by his buildings and plantations upon vicar's island in derwent water which his admiration such as it was of the country and probably a wish to be a leader in a new fashion had tempted him to purchase <\s>
<s> but what has all this to do with the subject why to show that a vivid perception of romantic scenery is neither inherent in mankind nor a necessary consequence of even a comprehensive education <\s>
<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>
<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>
<s> the wall was backed by a bank of earth and was exquisitely decorated with ivy flowers moss and ferns such as grow of themselves in like places but the mere notion of fitness associated with a trim garden wall prevented in this instance all sense of the spontaneous bounty and delicate care of nature <\s>
<s> in the midst of a small pleasure ground immediately below my house rises a detached rock equally remarkable for the beauty of its form the ancient oaks that grow out of it and the flowers and shrubs which adorn it <\s>
<s> what a nice place would this be said a manchester tradesman pointing to the rock if that ugly lump were but out of the way <\s>
<s> men as little advanced in the pleasure which such objects give to others are so far from being rare that they may be said fairly to represent a large majority of mankind <\s>
<s> this is a fact and none but the deceiver and the willingly deceived can be offended by its being stated <\s>
<s> but as a more susceptible taste is undoubtedly a great acquisition and has been spreading among us for some years the question is what means are most likely to be beneficial in extending its operation <\s>
<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>
<s> for further illustration of the subject turn to what we know of a man of extraordinary genius who was bred to hard labour in agricultural employments burns the poet <\s>
<s> when he had become distinguished by the publication of a volume of verses and was enabled to travel by the profit his poems brought him he made a tour in the course of which as his companion dr <\s>
<s> adair tells us he visited scenes inferior to none in scotland in beauty sublimity and romantic interest and the doctor having noticed with other companions that he seemed little moved upon one occasion by the sight of such a scene says 'i doubt if he had much taste for the picturesque <\s>
<s> the personal testimony however upon this point is conflicting but when dr <\s>
<s> currie refers to certain local poems as decisive proofs that burns fellow traveller was mistaken the biographer is surely unfortunate <\s>
<s> how vague and tame are the poet's expressions in those few local poems compared with his language when he is describing objects with which his position in life allowed him to be familiar <\s>
<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>

<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>

<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>
<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>
<s> the wall was backed by a bank of earth and was exquisitely decorated with ivy flowers moss and ferns such as grow of themselves in like places but the mere notion of fitness associated with a trim garden wall prevented in this instance all sense of the spontaneous bounty and delicate care of nature <\s>
<s> in the midst of a small pleasure ground immediately below my house rises a detached rock equally remarkable for the beauty of its form the ancient oaks that grow out of it and the flowers and shrubs which adorn it <\s>

<s> but as a more susceptible taste is undoubtedly a great acquisition and has been spreading among us for some years the question is what means are most likely to be beneficial in extending its operation <\s>
<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>

<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>
<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>
<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>

<s> rydal mount october 12th 1844 <\s>
<s> the degree and kind of attachment which many of the yeomanry feel to their small inheritances can scarcely be over rated <\s>
<s> near the house of one of them stands a magnificent tree which a neighbour of the owner advised him to fell for profit's sake <\s>
<s> fell it exclaimed the yeoman i had rather fall on my knees and worship it <\s>
<s> it happens i believe that the intended railway would pass through this little property and i hope that an apology for the answer will not be thought necessary by one who enters into the strength of the feeling <\s>
<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>

<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>
<s> the nuisance was swept away when the late mr <\s>
<s> curwen became the owner of this favoured spot <\s>
<s> english was followed by mr <\s>
<s> pocklington a native of nottinghamshire who played strange pranks by his buildings and plantations upon vicar's island in derwent water which his admiration such as it was of the country and probably a wish to be a leader in a new fashion had tempted him to purchase <\s>
<s> but what has all this to do with the subject why to show that a vivid perception of romantic scenery is neither inherent in mankind nor a necessary consequence of even a comprehensive education <\s>
<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>
<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>
<s> the wall was backed by a bank of earth and was exquisitely decorated with ivy flowers moss and ferns such as grow of themselves in like places but the mere notion of fitness associated with a trim garden wall prevented in this instance all sense of the spontaneous bounty and delicate care of nature <\s>
<s> in the midst of a small pleasure ground immediately below my house rises a detached rock equally remarkable for the beauty of its form the ancient oaks that grow out of it and the flowers and shrubs which adorn it <\s>
<s> what a nice place would this be said a manchester tradesman pointing to the rock if that ugly lump were but out of the way <\s>
<s> men as little advanced in the pleasure which such objects give to others are so far from being rare that they may be said fairly to represent a large majority of mankind <\s>
<s> this is a fact and none but the deceiver and the willingly deceived can be offended by its being stated <\s>
<s> but as a more susceptible taste is undoubtedly a great acquisition and has been spreading among us for some years the question is what means are most likely to be beneficial in extending its operation <\s>
<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>
<s> for further illustration of the subject turn to what we know of a man of extraordinary genius who was bred to hard labour in agricultural employments burns the poet <\s>
<s> when he had become distinguished by the publication of a volume of verses and was enabled to travel by the profit his poems brought him he made a tour in the course of which as his companion dr <\s>
<s> adair tells us he visited scenes inferior to none in scotland in beauty sublimity and romantic interest and the doctor having noticed with other companions that he seemed little moved upon one occasion by the sight of such a scene says 'i doubt if he had much taste for the picturesque <\s>
<s> the personal testimony however upon this point is conflicting but when dr <\s>
<s> currie refers to certain local poems as decisive proofs that burns fellow traveller was mistaken the biographer is surely unfortunate <\s>
<s> how vague and tame are the poet's expressions in those few local poems compared with his language when he is describing objects with which his position in life allowed him to be familiar <\s>
<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>
<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>
<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>
<s> the wide spread waters of these regions are in their nature peaceful so are the steep mountains and the rocky glens nor can they be profitably enjoyed but by a mind disposed to peace <\s>
<s> go to a pantomime a farce or a puppet show if you want noisy pleasure the crowd of spectators who partake your enjoyment will by their presence and acclamations enhance it but may those who have given proof that they prefer other gratifications continue to be safe from the molestation of cheap trains pouring out their hundreds at a time along the margin of windermere nor let any one be liable to the charge of being selfishly disregardful of the poor and their innocent and salutary enjoyments if he does not congratulate himself upon the especial benefit which would thus be conferred on such a concourse <\s>
<s> o nature a thy shows an forms to feeling pensive hearts hae charms <\s>
<s> so exclaimed the ayrshire ploughman speaking of ordinary rural nature under the varying influences of the seasons and the sentiment has found an echo in the bosoms of thousands in as humble a condition as he himself was when he gave vent to it <\s>
<s> but then they were feeling pensive hearts men who would be among the first to lament the facility with which they had approached this region by a sacrifice of so much of its quiet and beauty as from the intrusion of a railway would be inseparable <\s>
<s> what can in truth be more absurd than that either rich or poor should be spared the trouble of travelling by the high roads over so short a space according to their respective means if the unavoidable consequence must be a great disturbance of the retirement and in many places a destruction of the beauty of the country which the parties are come in search of <\s>
<s> would not this be pretty much like the child's cutting up his drum to learn where the sound came from <\s>
<s> having i trust given sufficient reason for the belief that the imperfectly educated classes are not likely to draw much good from rare visits to the lakes performed in this way and surely on their own account it is not desirable that the visits should be frequent let us glance at the mischief which such facilities would certainly produce <\s>
<s> the directors of railway companies are always ready to devise or encourage entertainments for tempting the humbler classes to leave their homes <\s>
<s> accordingly for the profit of the shareholders and that of the lower class of innkeepers we should have wrestling matches horse and boat races without number and pot houses and beer shops would keep pace with these excitements and recreations most of which might too easily be had elsewhere <\s>
<s> the injury which would thus be done to morals both among this influx of strangers and the lower class of inhabitants is obvious and supposing such extraordinary temptations not to be held out there cannot be a doubt that the sabbath day in the towns of bowness and ambleside and other parts of the district would be subject to much additional desecration <\s>
<s> whatever comes of the scheme which we have endeavoured to discountenance the charge against its opponents of being selfishly regardless of the poor ought to cease <\s>
<s> the cry has been raised and kept up by three classes of persons they who wish to bring into discredit all such as stand in the way of their gains or gambling speculations they who are dazzled by the application of physical science to the useful arts and indiscriminately applaud what they call the spirit of the age as manifested in this way and lastly those persons who are ever ready to step forward in what appears to them to be the cause of the poor but not always with becoming attention to particulars <\s>
<s> i am well aware that upon the first class what has been said will be of no avail but upon the two latter some impression will i trust be made <\s>
<s> the railway power we know well will not admit of being materially counteracted by sentiment and who would wish it where large towns are connected and the interests of trade and agriculture are substantially promoted by such mode of intercommunication <\s>
<s> but be it remembered that this case is as has been said before a peculiar one and that the staple of the country is its beauty and its character of retirement <\s>
<s> let then the beauty be undisfigured and the retirement unviolated unless there be reason for believing that rights and interests of a higher kind and more apparent than those which have been urged in behalf of the projected intrusion will compensate the sacrifice <\s>

<s> it happens i believe that the intended railway would pass through this little property and i hope that an apology for the answer will not be thought necessary by one who enters into the strength of the feeling <\s>
<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>
<s> the nuisance was swept away when the late mr <\s>
<s> curwen became the owner of this favoured spot <\s>
<s> english was followed by mr <\s>
<s> pocklington a native of nottinghamshire who played strange pranks by his buildings and plantations upon vicar's island in derwent water which his admiration such as it was of the country and probably a wish to be a leader in a new fashion had tempted him to purchase <\s>
<s> but what has all this to do with the subject why to show that a vivid perception of romantic scenery is neither inherent in mankind nor a necessary consequence of even a comprehensive education <\s>
<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>
<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>
<s> the wall was backed by a bank of earth and was exquisitely decorated with ivy flowers moss and ferns such as grow of themselves in like places but the mere notion of fitness associated with a trim garden wall prevented in this instance all sense of the spontaneous bounty and delicate care of nature <\s>
<s> in the midst of a small pleasure ground immediately below my house rises a detached rock equally remarkable for the beauty of its form the ancient oaks that grow out of it and the flowers and shrubs which adorn it <\s>
<s> what a nice place would this be said a manchester tradesman pointing to the rock if that ugly lump were but out of the way <\s>
<s> men as little advanced in the pleasure which such objects give to others are so far from being rare that they may be said fairly to represent a large majority of mankind <\s>
<s> this is a fact and none but the deceiver and the willingly deceived can be offended by its being stated <\s>
<s> but as a more susceptible taste is undoubtedly a great acquisition and has been spreading among us for some years the question is what means are most likely to be beneficial in extending its operation <\s>
<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>
<s> for further illustration of the subject turn to what we know of a man of extraordinary genius who was bred to hard labour in agricultural employments burns the poet <\s>
<s> when he had become distinguished by the publication of a volume of verses and was enabled to travel by the profit his poems brought him he made a tour in the course of which as his companion dr <\s>
<s> adair tells us he visited scenes inferior to none in scotland in beauty sublimity and romantic interest and the doctor having noticed with other companions that he seemed little moved upon one occasion by the sight of such a scene says 'i doubt if he had much taste for the picturesque <\s>
<s> the personal testimony however upon this point is conflicting but when dr <\s>
<s> currie refers to certain local poems as decisive proofs that burns fellow traveller was mistaken the biographer is surely unfortunate <\s>
<s> how vague and tame are the poet's expressions in those few local poems compared with his language when he is describing objects with which his position in life allowed him to be familiar <\s>
<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>
<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>
<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>
<s> the wide spread waters of these regions are in their nature peaceful so are the steep mountains and the rocky glens nor can they be profitably enjoyed but by a mind disposed to peace <\s>
<s> go to a pantomime a farce or a puppet show if you want noisy pleasure the crowd of spectators who partake your enjoyment will by their presence and acclamations enhance it but may those who have given proof that they prefer other gratifications continue to be safe from the molestation of cheap trains pouring out their hundreds at a time along the margin of windermere nor let any one be liable to the charge of being selfishly disregardful of the poor and their innocent and salutary enjoyments if he does not congratulate himself upon the especial benefit which would thus be conferred on such a concourse <\s>
<s> o nature a thy shows an forms to feeling pensive hearts hae charms <\s>
<s> so exclaimed the ayrshire ploughman speaking of ordinary rural nature under the varying influences of the seasons and the sentiment has found an echo in the bosoms of thousands in as humble a condition as he himself was when he gave vent to it <\s>

<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>

<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>

<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>

<s> near the house of one of them stands a magnificent tree which a neighbour of the owner advised him to fell for profit's sake <\s>
<s> fell it exclaimed the yeoman i had rather fall on my knees and worship it <\s>
<s> it happens i believe that the intended railway would pass through this little property and i hope that an apology for the answer will not be thought necessary by one who enters into the strength of the feeling <\s>
<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>
<s> the nuisance was swept away when the late mr <\s>
<s> curwen became the owner of this favoured spot <\s>
<s> english was followed by mr <\s>
<s> pocklington a native of nottinghamshire who played strange pranks by his buildings and plantations upon vicar's island in derwent water which his admiration such as it was of the country and probably a wish to be a leader in a new fashion had tempted him to purchase <\s>
<s> but what has all this to do with the subject why to show that a vivid perception of romantic scenery is neither inherent in mankind nor a necessary consequence of even a comprehensive education <\s>
<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>

<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>

<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>

<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>

<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>

<s> how vague and tame are the poet's expressions in those few local poems compared with his language when he is describing objects with which his position in life allowed him to be familiar <\s>
<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>
<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>
<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>

<s> would not this be pretty much like the child's cutting up his drum to learn where the sound came from <\s>

<s> whatever comes of the scheme which we have endeavoured to discountenance the charge against its opponents of being selfishly regardless of the poor ought to cease <\s>
<s> the cry has been raised and kept up by three classes of persons they who wish to bring into discredit all such as stand in the way of their gains or gambling speculations they who are dazzled by the application of physical science to the useful arts and indiscriminately applaud what they call the spirit of the age as manifested in this way and lastly those persons who are ever ready to step forward in what appears to them to be the cause of the poor but not always with becoming attention to particulars <\s>
<s> i am well aware that upon the first class what has been said will be of no avail but upon the two latter some impression will i trust be made <\s>

<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>

<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>
<s> the nuisance was swept away when the late mr <\s>
<s> curwen became the owner of this favoured spot <\s>
<s> english was followed by mr <\s>
<s> pocklington a native of nottinghamshire who played strange pranks by his buildings and plantations upon vicar's island in derwent water which his admiration such as it was of the country and probably a wish to be a leader in a new fashion had tempted him to purchase <\s>
<s> but what has all this to do with the subject why to show that a vivid perception of romantic scenery is neither inherent in mankind nor a necessary consequence of even a comprehensive education <\s>
<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>
<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>
<s> the wall was backed by a bank of earth and was exquisitely decorated with ivy flowers moss and ferns such as grow of themselves in like places but the mere notion of fitness associated with a trim garden wall prevented in this instance all sense of the spontaneous bounty and delicate care of nature <\s>
<s> in the midst of a small pleasure ground immediately below my house rises a detached rock equally remarkable for the beauty of its form the ancient oaks that grow out of it and the flowers and shrubs which adorn it <\s>
<s> what a nice place would this be said a manchester tradesman pointing to the rock if that ugly lump were but out of the way <\s>
<s> men as little advanced in the pleasure which such objects give to others are so far from being rare that they may be said fairly to represent a large majority of mankind <\s>
<s> this is a fact and none but the deceiver and the willingly deceived can be offended by its being stated <\s>
<s> but as a more susceptible taste is undoubtedly a great acquisition and has been spreading among us for some years the question is what means are most likely to be beneficial in extending its operation <\s>
<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>
<s> for further illustration of the subject turn to what we know of a man of extraordinary genius who was bred to hard labour in agricultural employments burns the poet <\s>
<s> when he had become distinguished by the publication of a volume of verses and was enabled to travel by the profit his poems brought him he made a tour in the course of which as his companion dr <\s>
<s> adair tells us he visited scenes inferior to none in scotland in beauty sublimity and romantic interest and the doctor having noticed with other companions that he seemed little moved upon one occasion by the sight of such a scene says 'i doubt if he had much taste for the picturesque <\s>
<s> the personal testimony however upon this point is conflicting but when dr <\s>
<s> currie refers to certain local poems as decisive proofs that burns fellow traveller was mistaken the biographer is surely unfortunate <\s>
<s> how vague and tame are the poet's expressions in those few local poems compared with his language when he is describing objects with which his position in life allowed him to be familiar <\s>
<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>
<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>
<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>
<s> the wide spread waters of these regions are in their nature peaceful so are the steep mountains and the rocky glens nor can they be profitably enjoyed but by a mind disposed to peace <\s>
<s> go to a pantomime a farce or a puppet show if you want noisy pleasure the crowd of spectators who partake your enjoyment will by their presence and acclamations enhance it but may those who have given proof that they prefer other gratifications continue to be safe from the molestation of cheap trains pouring out their hundreds at a time along the margin of windermere nor let any one be liable to the charge of being selfishly disregardful of the poor and their innocent and salutary enjoyments if he does not congratulate himself upon the especial benefit which would thus be conferred on such a concourse <\s>
<s> o nature a thy shows an forms to feeling pensive hearts hae charms <\s>
<s> so exclaimed the ayrshire ploughman speaking of ordinary rural nature under the varying influences of the seasons and the sentiment has found an echo in the bosoms of thousands in as humble a condition as he himself was when he gave vent to it <\s>
<s> but then they were feeling pensive hearts men who would be among the first to lament the facility with which they had approached this region by a sacrifice of so much of its quiet and beauty as from the intrusion of a railway would be inseparable <\s>
<s> what can in truth be more absurd than that either rich or poor should be spared the trouble of travelling by the high roads over so short a space according to their respective means if the unavoidable consequence must be a great disturbance of the retirement and in many places a destruction of the beauty of the country which the parties are come in search of <\s>
<s> would not this be pretty much like the child's cutting up his drum to learn where the sound came from <\s>
<s> having i trust given sufficient reason for the belief that the imperfectly educated classes are not likely to draw much good from rare visits to the lakes performed in this way and surely on their own account it is not desirable that the visits should be frequent let us glance at the mischief which such facilities would certainly produce <\s>
<s> the directors of railway companies are always ready to devise or encourage entertainments for tempting the humbler classes to leave their homes <\s>
<s> accordingly for the profit of the shareholders and that of the lower class of innkeepers we should have wrestling matches horse and boat races without number and pot houses and beer shops would keep pace with these excitements and recreations most of which might too easily be had elsewhere <\s>
<s> the injury which would thus be done to morals both among this influx of strangers and the lower class of inhabitants is obvious and supposing such extraordinary temptations not to be held out there cannot be a doubt that the sabbath day in the towns of bowness and ambleside and other parts of the district would be subject to much additional desecration <\s>
<s> whatever comes of the scheme which we have endeavoured to discountenance the charge against its opponents of being selfishly regardless of the poor ought to cease <\s>
<s> the cry has been raised and kept up by three classes of persons they who wish to bring into discredit all such as stand in the way of their gains or gambling speculations they who are dazzled by the application of physical science to the useful arts and indiscriminately applaud what they call the spirit of the age as manifested in this way and lastly those persons who are ever ready to step forward in what appears to them to be the cause of the poor but not always with becoming attention to particulars <\s>

<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>

<s> how vague and tame are the poet's expressions in those few local poems compared with his language when he is describing objects with which his position in life allowed him to be familiar <\s>
<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>
<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>
<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>

<s> it happens i believe that the intended railway would pass through this little property and i hope that an apology for the answer will not be thought necessary by one who enters into the strength of the feeling <\s>
<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>
<s> the nuisance was swept away when the late mr <\s>
<s> curwen became the owner of this favoured spot <\s>
<s> english was followed by mr <\s>
<s> pocklington a native of nottinghamshire who played strange pranks by his buildings and plantations upon vicar's island in derwent water which his admiration such as it was of the country and probably a wish to be a leader in a new fashion had tempted him to purchase <\s>
<s> but what has all this to do with the subject why to show that a vivid perception of romantic scenery is neither inherent in mankind nor a necessary consequence of even a comprehensive education <\s>
<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>
<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>
<s> the wall was backed by a bank of earth and was exquisitely decorated with ivy flowers moss and ferns such as grow of themselves in like places but the mere notion of fitness associated with a trim garden wall prevented in this instance all sense of the spontaneous bounty and delicate care of nature <\s>
<s> in the midst of a small pleasure ground immediately below my house rises a detached rock equally remarkable for the beauty of its form the ancient oaks that grow out of it and the flowers and shrubs which adorn it <\s>
<s> what a nice place would this be said a manchester tradesman pointing to the rock if that ugly lump were but out of the way <\s>
<s> men as little advanced in the pleasure which such objects give to others are so far from being rare that they may be said fairly to represent a large majority of mankind <\s>
<s> this is a fact and none but the deceiver and the willingly deceived can be offended by its being stated <\s>
<s> but as a more susceptible taste is undoubtedly a great acquisition and has been spreading among us for some years the question is what means are most likely to be beneficial in extending its operation <\s>
<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>

<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>

<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>

<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>

<s> it happens i believe that the intended railway would pass through this little property and i hope that an apology for the answer will not be thought necessary by one who enters into the strength of the feeling <\s>
<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>

<s> it happens i believe that the intended railway would pass through this little property and i hope that an apology for the answer will not be thought necessary by one who enters into the strength of the feeling <\s>
<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>
<s> the nuisance was swept away when the late mr <\s>
<s> curwen became the owner of this favoured spot <\s>
<s> english was followed by mr <\s>
<s> pocklington a native of nottinghamshire who played strange pranks by his buildings and plantations upon vicar's island in derwent water which his admiration such as it was of the country and probably a wish to be a leader in a new fashion had tempted him to purchase <\s>
<s> but what has all this to do with the subject why to show that a vivid perception of romantic scenery is neither inherent in mankind nor a necessary consequence of even a comprehensive education <\s>
<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>
<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>
<s> the wall was backed by a bank of earth and was exquisitely decorated with ivy flowers moss and ferns such as grow of themselves in like places but the mere notion of fitness associated with a trim garden wall prevented in this instance all sense of the spontaneous bounty and delicate care of nature <\s>
<s> in the midst of a small pleasure ground immediately below my house rises a detached rock equally remarkable for the beauty of its form the ancient oaks that grow out of it and the flowers and shrubs which adorn it <\s>
<s> what a nice place would this be said a manchester tradesman pointing to the rock if that ugly lump were but out of the way <\s>
<s> men as little advanced in the pleasure which such objects give to others are so far from being rare that they may be said fairly to represent a large majority of mankind <\s>
<s> this is a fact and none but the deceiver and the willingly deceived can be offended by its being stated <\s>
<s> but as a more susceptible taste is undoubtedly a great acquisition and has been spreading among us for some years the question is what means are most likely to be beneficial in extending its operation <\s>
<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>
<s> for further illustration of the subject turn to what we know of a man of extraordinary genius who was bred to hard labour in agricultural employments burns the poet <\s>
<s> when he had become distinguished by the publication of a volume of verses and was enabled to travel by the profit his poems brought him he made a tour in the course of which as his companion dr <\s>
<s> adair tells us he visited scenes inferior to none in scotland in beauty sublimity and romantic interest and the doctor having noticed with other companions that he seemed little moved upon one occasion by the sight of such a scene says 'i doubt if he had much taste for the picturesque <\s>
<s> the personal testimony however upon this point is conflicting but when dr <\s>
<s> currie refers to certain local poems as decisive proofs that burns fellow traveller was mistaken the biographer is surely unfortunate <\s>
<s> how vague and tame are the poet's expressions in those few local poems compared with his language when he is describing objects with which his position in life allowed him to be familiar <\s>
<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>
<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>
<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>
<s> the wide spread waters of these regions are in their nature peaceful so are the steep mountains and the rocky glens nor can they be profitably enjoyed but by a mind disposed to peace <\s>
<s> go to a pantomime a farce or a puppet show if you want noisy pleasure the crowd of spectators who partake your enjoyment will by their presence and acclamations enhance it but may those who have given proof that they prefer other gratifications continue to be safe from the molestation of cheap trains pouring out their hundreds at a time along the margin of windermere nor let any one be liable to the charge of being selfishly disregardful of the poor and their innocent and salutary enjoyments if he does not congratulate himself upon the especial benefit which would thus be conferred on such a concourse <\s>
<s> o nature a thy shows an forms to feeling pensive hearts hae charms <\s>
<s> so exclaimed the ayrshire ploughman speaking of ordinary rural nature under the varying influences of the seasons and the sentiment has found an echo in the bosoms of thousands in as humble a condition as he himself was when he gave vent to it <\s>
<s> but then they were feeling pensive hearts men who would be among the first to lament the facility with which they had approached this region by a sacrifice of so much of its quiet and beauty as from the intrusion of a railway would be inseparable <\s>
<s> what can in truth be more absurd than that either rich or poor should be spared the trouble of travelling by the high roads over so short a space according to their respective means if the unavoidable consequence must be a great disturbance of the retirement and in many places a destruction of the beauty of the country which the parties are come in search of <\s>
<s> would not this be pretty much like the child's cutting up his drum to learn where the sound came from <\s>
<s> having i trust given sufficient reason for the belief that the imperfectly educated classes are not likely to draw much good from rare visits to the lakes performed in this way and surely on their own account it is not desirable that the visits should be frequent let us glance at the mischief which such facilities would certainly produce <\s>
<s> the directors of railway companies are always ready to devise or encourage entertainments for tempting the humbler classes to leave their homes <\s>
<s> accordingly for the profit of the shareholders and that of the lower class of innkeepers we should have wrestling matches horse and boat races without number and pot houses and beer shops would keep pace with these excitements and recreations most of which might too easily be had elsewhere <\s>
<s> the injury which would thus be done to morals both among this influx of strangers and the lower class of inhabitants is obvious and supposing such extraordinary temptations not to be held out there cannot be a doubt that the sabbath day in the towns of bowness and ambleside and other parts of the district would be subject to much additional desecration <\s>
<s> whatever comes of the scheme which we have endeavoured to discountenance the charge against its opponents of being selfishly regardless of the poor ought to cease <\s>
<s> the cry has been raised and kept up by three classes of persons they who wish to bring into discredit all such as stand in the way of their gains or gambling speculations they who are dazzled by the application of physical science to the useful arts and indiscriminately applaud what they call the spirit of the age as manifested in this way and lastly those persons who are ever ready to step forward in what appears to them to be the cause of the poor but not always with becoming attention to particulars <\s>
<s> i am well aware that upon the first class what has been said will be of no avail but upon the two latter some impression will i trust be made <\s>
<s> the railway power we know well will not admit of being materially counteracted by sentiment and who would wish it where large towns are connected and the interests of trade and agriculture are substantially promoted by such mode of intercommunication <\s>
<s> but be it remembered that this case is as has been said before a peculiar one and that the staple of the country is its beauty and its character of retirement <\s>
<s> let then the beauty be undisfigured and the retirement unviolated unless there be reason for believing that rights and interests of a higher kind and more apparent than those which have been urged in behalf of the projected intrusion will compensate the sacrifice <\s>
<s> thanking you for the judicious observations that have appeared in your paper upon the subject of railways i remain sir your obliged wm <\s>
<s> note to the instances named in this letter of the indifference even of men of genius to the sublime forms of nature in mountainous districts the author of the interesting essays in the morning post entitled table talk has justly added goldsmith and i give the passage in his own words <\s>
<s> the simple and gentle hearted goldsmith who had an exquisite sense of rural beauty in the familiar forms of hill and dale and meadows with their hawthorn scented hedges does not seem to have dreamt of any such thing as beauty in the swiss alps though he traversed them on foot and had therefore the best opportunities of observing them <\s>

<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>
<s> the nuisance was swept away when the late mr <\s>
<s> curwen became the owner of this favoured spot <\s>
<s> english was followed by mr <\s>
<s> pocklington a native of nottinghamshire who played strange pranks by his buildings and plantations upon vicar's island in derwent water which his admiration such as it was of the country and probably a wish to be a leader in a new fashion had tempted him to purchase <\s>
<s> but what has all this to do with the subject why to show that a vivid perception of romantic scenery is neither inherent in mankind nor a necessary consequence of even a comprehensive education <\s>
<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>
<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>
<s> the wall was backed by a bank of earth and was exquisitely decorated with ivy flowers moss and ferns such as grow of themselves in like places but the mere notion of fitness associated with a trim garden wall prevented in this instance all sense of the spontaneous bounty and delicate care of nature <\s>
<s> in the midst of a small pleasure ground immediately below my house rises a detached rock equally remarkable for the beauty of its form the ancient oaks that grow out of it and the flowers and shrubs which adorn it <\s>
<s> what a nice place would this be said a manchester tradesman pointing to the rock if that ugly lump were but out of the way <\s>
<s> men as little advanced in the pleasure which such objects give to others are so far from being rare that they may be said fairly to represent a large majority of mankind <\s>
<s> this is a fact and none but the deceiver and the willingly deceived can be offended by its being stated <\s>
<s> but as a more susceptible taste is undoubtedly a great acquisition and has been spreading among us for some years the question is what means are most likely to be beneficial in extending its operation <\s>
<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>
<s> for further illustration of the subject turn to what we know of a man of extraordinary genius who was bred to hard labour in agricultural employments burns the poet <\s>
<s> when he had become distinguished by the publication of a volume of verses and was enabled to travel by the profit his poems brought him he made a tour in the course of which as his companion dr <\s>
<s> adair tells us he visited scenes inferior to none in scotland in beauty sublimity and romantic interest and the doctor having noticed with other companions that he seemed little moved upon one occasion by the sight of such a scene says 'i doubt if he had much taste for the picturesque <\s>
<s> the personal testimony however upon this point is conflicting but when dr <\s>
<s> currie refers to certain local poems as decisive proofs that burns fellow traveller was mistaken the biographer is surely unfortunate <\s>
<s> how vague and tame are the poet's expressions in those few local poems compared with his language when he is describing objects with which his position in life allowed him to be familiar <\s>
<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>

<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>

<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>
<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>
<s> the wall was backed by a bank of earth and was exquisitely decorated with ivy flowers moss and ferns such as grow of themselves in like places but the mere notion of fitness associated with a trim garden wall prevented in this instance all sense of the spontaneous bounty and delicate care of nature <\s>
<s> in the midst of a small pleasure ground immediately below my house rises a detached rock equally remarkable for the beauty of its form the ancient oaks that grow out of it and the flowers and shrubs which adorn it <\s>

<s> but as a more susceptible taste is undoubtedly a great acquisition and has been spreading among us for some years the question is what means are most likely to be beneficial in extending its operation <\s>
<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>

<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>
<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>
<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>

<s> rydal mount october 12th 1844 <\s>
<s> the degree and kind of attachment which many of the yeomanry feel to their small inheritances can scarcely be over rated <\s>
<s> near the house of one of them stands a magnificent tree which a neighbour of the owner advised him to fell for profit's sake <\s>
<s> fell it exclaimed the yeoman i had rather fall on my knees and worship it <\s>
<s> it happens i believe that the intended railway would pass through this little property and i hope that an apology for the answer will not be thought necessary by one who enters into the strength of the feeling <\s>
<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>

<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>
<s> the nuisance was swept away when the late mr <\s>
<s> curwen became the owner of this favoured spot <\s>
<s> english was followed by mr <\s>
<s> pocklington a native of nottinghamshire who played strange pranks by his buildings and plantations upon vicar's island in derwent water which his admiration such as it was of the country and probably a wish to be a leader in a new fashion had tempted him to purchase <\s>
<s> but what has all this to do with the subject why to show that a vivid perception of romantic scenery is neither inherent in mankind nor a necessary consequence of even a comprehensive education <\s>
<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>
<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>
<s> the wall was backed by a bank of earth and was exquisitely decorated with ivy flowers moss and ferns such as grow of themselves in like places but the mere notion of fitness associated with a trim garden wall prevented in this instance all sense of the spontaneous bounty and delicate care of nature <\s>
<s> in the midst of a small pleasure ground immediately below my house rises a detached rock equally remarkable for the beauty of its form the ancient oaks that grow out of it and the flowers and shrubs which adorn it <\s>
<s> what a nice place would this be said a manchester tradesman pointing to the rock if that ugly lump were but out of the way <\s>
<s> men as little advanced in the pleasure which such objects give to others are so far from being rare that they may be said fairly to represent a large majority of mankind <\s>
<s> this is a fact and none but the deceiver and the willingly deceived can be offended by its being stated <\s>
<s> but as a more susceptible taste is undoubtedly a great acquisition and has been spreading among us for some years the question is what means are most likely to be beneficial in extending its operation <\s>
<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>
<s> for further illustration of the subject turn to what we know of a man of extraordinary genius who was bred to hard labour in agricultural employments burns the poet <\s>
<s> when he had become distinguished by the publication of a volume of verses and was enabled to travel by the profit his poems brought him he made a tour in the course of which as his companion dr <\s>
<s> adair tells us he visited scenes inferior to none in scotland in beauty sublimity and romantic interest and the doctor having noticed with other companions that he seemed little moved upon one occasion by the sight of such a scene says 'i doubt if he had much taste for the picturesque <\s>
<s> the personal testimony however upon this point is conflicting but when dr <\s>
<s> currie refers to certain local poems as decisive proofs that burns fellow traveller was mistaken the biographer is surely unfortunate <\s>
<s> how vague and tame are the poet's expressions in those few local poems compared with his language when he is describing objects with which his position in life allowed him to be familiar <\s>
<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>
<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>
<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>
<s> the wide spread waters of these regions are in their nature peaceful so are the steep mountains and the rocky glens nor can they be profitably enjoyed but by a mind disposed to peace <\s>
<s> go to a pantomime a farce or a puppet show if you want noisy pleasure the crowd of spectators who partake your enjoyment will by their presence and acclamations enhance it but may those who have given proof that they prefer other gratifications continue to be safe from the molestation of cheap trains pouring out their hundreds at a time along the margin of windermere nor let any one be liable to the charge of being selfishly disregardful of the poor and their innocent and salutary enjoyments if he does not congratulate himself upon the especial benefit which would thus be conferred on such a concourse <\s>
<s> o nature a thy shows an forms to feeling pensive hearts hae charms <\s>
<s> so exclaimed the ayrshire ploughman speaking of ordinary rural nature under the varying influences of the seasons and the sentiment has found an echo in the bosoms of thousands in as humble a condition as he himself was when he gave vent to it <\s>
<s> but then they were feeling pensive hearts men who would be among the first to lament the facility with which they had approached this region by a sacrifice of so much of its quiet and beauty as from the intrusion of a railway would be inseparable <\s>
<s> what can in truth be more absurd than that either rich or poor should be spared the trouble of travelling by the high roads over so short a space according to their respective means if the unavoidable consequence must be a great disturbance of the retirement and in many places a destruction of the beauty of the country which the parties are come in search of <\s>
<s> would not this be pretty much like the child's cutting up his drum to learn where the sound came from <\s>
<s> having i trust given sufficient reason for the belief that the imperfectly educated classes are not likely to draw much good from rare visits to the lakes performed in this way and surely on their own account it is not desirable that the visits should be frequent let us glance at the mischief which such facilities would certainly produce <\s>
<s> the directors of railway companies are always ready to devise or encourage entertainments for tempting the humbler classes to leave their homes <\s>
<s> accordingly for the profit of the shareholders and that of the lower class of innkeepers we should have wrestling matches horse and boat races without number and pot houses and beer shops would keep pace with these excitements and recreations most of which might too easily be had elsewhere <\s>
<s> the injury which would thus be done to morals both among this influx of strangers and the lower class of inhabitants is obvious and supposing such extraordinary temptations not to be held out there cannot be a doubt that the sabbath day in the towns of bowness and ambleside and other parts of the district would be subject to much additional desecration <\s>
<s> whatever comes of the scheme which we have endeavoured to discountenance the charge against its opponents of being selfishly regardless of the poor ought to cease <\s>
<s> the cry has been raised and kept up by three classes of persons they who wish to bring into discredit all such as stand in the way of their gains or gambling speculations they who are dazzled by the application of physical science to the useful arts and indiscriminately applaud what they call the spirit of the age as manifested in this way and lastly those persons who are ever ready to step forward in what appears to them to be the cause of the poor but not always with becoming attention to particulars <\s>
<s> i am well aware that upon the first class what has been said will be of no avail but upon the two latter some impression will i trust be made <\s>
<s> the railway power we know well will not admit of being materially counteracted by sentiment and who would wish it where large towns are connected and the interests of trade and agriculture are substantially promoted by such mode of intercommunication <\s>
<s> but be it remembered that this case is as has been said before a peculiar one and that the staple of the country is its beauty and its character of retirement <\s>
<s> let then the beauty be undisfigured and the retirement unviolated unless there be reason for believing that rights and interests of a higher kind and more apparent than those which have been urged in behalf of the projected intrusion will compensate the sacrifice <\s>

<s> it happens i believe that the intended railway would pass through this little property and i hope that an apology for the answer will not be thought necessary by one who enters into the strength of the feeling <\s>
<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>
<s> the nuisance was swept away when the late mr <\s>
<s> curwen became the owner of this favoured spot <\s>
<s> english was followed by mr <\s>
<s> pocklington a native of nottinghamshire who played strange pranks by his buildings and plantations upon vicar's island in derwent water which his admiration such as it was of the country and probably a wish to be a leader in a new fashion had tempted him to purchase <\s>
<s> but what has all this to do with the subject why to show that a vivid perception of romantic scenery is neither inherent in mankind nor a necessary consequence of even a comprehensive education <\s>
<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>
<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>
<s> the wall was backed by a bank of earth and was exquisitely decorated with ivy flowers moss and ferns such as grow of themselves in like places but the mere notion of fitness associated with a trim garden wall prevented in this instance all sense of the spontaneous bounty and delicate care of nature <\s>
<s> in the midst of a small pleasure ground immediately below my house rises a detached rock equally remarkable for the beauty of its form the ancient oaks that grow out of it and the flowers and shrubs which adorn it <\s>
<s> what a nice place would this be said a manchester tradesman pointing to the rock if that ugly lump were but out of the way <\s>
<s> men as little advanced in the pleasure which such objects give to others are so far from being rare that they may be said fairly to represent a large majority of mankind <\s>
<s> this is a fact and none but the deceiver and the willingly deceived can be offended by its being stated <\s>
<s> but as a more susceptible taste is undoubtedly a great acquisition and has been spreading among us for some years the question is what means are most likely to be beneficial in extending its operation <\s>
<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>
<s> for further illustration of the subject turn to what we know of a man of extraordinary genius who was bred to hard labour in agricultural employments burns the poet <\s>
<s> when he had become distinguished by the publication of a volume of verses and was enabled to travel by the profit his poems brought him he made a tour in the course of which as his companion dr <\s>
<s> adair tells us he visited scenes inferior to none in scotland in beauty sublimity and romantic interest and the doctor having noticed with other companions that he seemed little moved upon one occasion by the sight of such a scene says 'i doubt if he had much taste for the picturesque <\s>
<s> the personal testimony however upon this point is conflicting but when dr <\s>
<s> currie refers to certain local poems as decisive proofs that burns fellow traveller was mistaken the biographer is surely unfortunate <\s>
<s> how vague and tame are the poet's expressions in those few local poems compared with his language when he is describing objects with which his position in life allowed him to be familiar <\s>
<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>
<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>
<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>
<s> the wide spread waters of these regions are in their nature peaceful so are the steep mountains and the rocky glens nor can they be profitably enjoyed but by a mind disposed to peace <\s>
<s> go to a pantomime a farce or a puppet show if you want noisy pleasure the crowd of spectators who partake your enjoyment will by their presence and acclamations enhance it but may those who have given proof that they prefer other gratifications continue to be safe from the molestation of cheap trains pouring out their hundreds at a time along the margin of windermere nor let any one be liable to the charge of being selfishly disregardful of the poor and their innocent and salutary enjoyments if he does not congratulate himself upon the especial benefit which would thus be conferred on such a concourse <\s>
<s> o nature a thy shows an forms to feeling pensive hearts hae charms <\s>
<s> so exclaimed the ayrshire ploughman speaking of ordinary rural nature under the varying influences of the seasons and the sentiment has found an echo in the bosoms of thousands in as humble a condition as he himself was when he gave vent to it <\s>

<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>

<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>

<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>

<s> near the house of one of them stands a magnificent tree which a neighbour of the owner advised him to fell for profit's sake <\s>
<s> fell it exclaimed the yeoman i had rather fall on my knees and worship it <\s>
<s> it happens i believe that the intended railway would pass through this little property and i hope that an apology for the answer will not be thought necessary by one who enters into the strength of the feeling <\s>
<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>
<s> the nuisance was swept away when the late mr <\s>
<s> curwen became the owner of this favoured spot <\s>
<s> english was followed by mr <\s>
<s> pocklington a native of nottinghamshire who played strange pranks by his buildings and plantations upon vicar's island in derwent water which his admiration such as it was of the country and probably a wish to be a leader in a new fashion had tempted him to purchase <\s>
<s> but what has all this to do with the subject why to show that a vivid perception of romantic scenery is neither inherent in mankind nor a necessary consequence of even a comprehensive education <\s>
<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>

<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>

<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>

<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>

<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>

<s> how vague and tame are the poet's expressions in those few local poems compared with his language when he is describing objects with which his position in life allowed him to be familiar <\s>
<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>
<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>
<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>

<s> would not this be pretty much like the child's cutting up his drum to learn where the sound came from <\s>

<s> whatever comes of the scheme which we have endeavoured to discountenance the charge against its opponents of being selfishly regardless of the poor ought to cease <\s>
<s> the cry has been raised and kept up by three classes of persons they who wish to bring into discredit all such as stand in the way of their gains or gambling speculations they who are dazzled by the application of physical science to the useful arts and indiscriminately applaud what they call the spirit of the age as manifested in this way and lastly those persons who are ever ready to step forward in what appears to them to be the cause of the poor but not always with becoming attention to particulars <\s>
<s> i am well aware that upon the first class what has been said will be of no avail but upon the two latter some impression will i trust be made <\s>

<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>

<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>
<s> the nuisance was swept away when the late mr <\s>
<s> curwen became the owner of this favoured spot <\s>
<s> english was followed by mr <\s>
<s> pocklington a native of nottinghamshire who played strange pranks by his buildings and plantations upon vicar's island in derwent water which his admiration such as it was of the country and probably a wish to be a leader in a new fashion had tempted him to purchase <\s>
<s> but what has all this to do with the subject why to show that a vivid perception of romantic scenery is neither inherent in mankind nor a necessary consequence of even a comprehensive education <\s>
<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>
<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>
<s> the wall was backed by a bank of earth and was exquisitely decorated with ivy flowers moss and ferns such as grow of themselves in like places but the mere notion of fitness associated with a trim garden wall prevented in this instance all sense of the spontaneous bounty and delicate care of nature <\s>
<s> in the midst of a small pleasure ground immediately below my house rises a detached rock equally remarkable for the beauty of its form the ancient oaks that grow out of it and the flowers and shrubs which adorn it <\s>
<s> what a nice place would this be said a manchester tradesman pointing to the rock if that ugly lump were but out of the way <\s>
<s> men as little advanced in the pleasure which such objects give to others are so far from being rare that they may be said fairly to represent a large majority of mankind <\s>
<s> this is a fact and none but the deceiver and the willingly deceived can be offended by its being stated <\s>
<s> but as a more susceptible taste is undoubtedly a great acquisition and has been spreading among us for some years the question is what means are most likely to be beneficial in extending its operation <\s>
<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>
<s> for further illustration of the subject turn to what we know of a man of extraordinary genius who was bred to hard labour in agricultural employments burns the poet <\s>
<s> when he had become distinguished by the publication of a volume of verses and was enabled to travel by the profit his poems brought him he made a tour in the course of which as his companion dr <\s>
<s> adair tells us he visited scenes inferior to none in scotland in beauty sublimity and romantic interest and the doctor having noticed with other companions that he seemed little moved upon one occasion by the sight of such a scene says 'i doubt if he had much taste for the picturesque <\s>
<s> the personal testimony however upon this point is conflicting but when dr <\s>
<s> currie refers to certain local poems as decisive proofs that burns fellow traveller was mistaken the biographer is surely unfortunate <\s>
<s> how vague and tame are the poet's expressions in those few local poems compared with his language when he is describing objects with which his position in life allowed him to be familiar <\s>
<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>
<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>
<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>
<s> the wide spread waters of these regions are in their nature peaceful so are the steep mountains and the rocky glens nor can they be profitably enjoyed but by a mind disposed to peace <\s>
<s> go to a pantomime a farce or a puppet show if you want noisy pleasure the crowd of spectators who partake your enjoyment will by their presence and acclamations enhance it but may those who have given proof that they prefer other gratifications continue to be safe from the molestation of cheap trains pouring out their hundreds at a time along the margin of windermere nor let any one be liable to the charge of being selfishly disregardful of the poor and their innocent and salutary enjoyments if he does not congratulate himself upon the especial benefit which would thus be conferred on such a concourse <\s>
<s> o nature a thy shows an forms to feeling pensive hearts hae charms <\s>
<s> so exclaimed the ayrshire ploughman speaking of ordinary rural nature under the varying influences of the seasons and the sentiment has found an echo in the bosoms of thousands in as humble a condition as he himself was when he gave vent to it <\s>
<s> but then they were feeling pensive hearts men who would be among the first to lament the facility with which they had approached this region by a sacrifice of so much of its quiet and beauty as from the intrusion of a railway would be inseparable <\s>
<s> what can in truth be more absurd than that either rich or poor should be spared the trouble of travelling by the high roads over so short a space according to their respective means if the unavoidable consequence must be a great disturbance of the retirement and in many places a destruction of the beauty of the country which the parties are come in search of <\s>
<s> would not this be pretty much like the child's cutting up his drum to learn where the sound came from <\s>
<s> having i trust given sufficient reason for the belief that the imperfectly educated classes are not likely to draw much good from rare visits to the lakes performed in this way and surely on their own account it is not desirable that the visits should be frequent let us glance at the mischief which such facilities would certainly produce <\s>
<s> the directors of railway companies are always ready to devise or encourage entertainments for tempting the humbler classes to leave their homes <\s>
<s> accordingly for the profit of the shareholders and that of the lower class of innkeepers we should have wrestling matches horse and boat races without number and pot houses and beer shops would keep pace with these excitements and recreations most of which might too easily be had elsewhere <\s>
<s> the injury which would thus be done to morals both among this influx of strangers and the lower class of inhabitants is obvious and supposing such extraordinary temptations not to be held out there cannot be a doubt that the sabbath day in the towns of bowness and ambleside and other parts of the district would be subject to much additional desecration <\s>
<s> whatever comes of the scheme which we have endeavoured to discountenance the charge against its opponents of being selfishly regardless of the poor ought to cease <\s>
<s> the cry has been raised and kept up by three classes of persons they who wish to bring into discredit all such as stand in the way of their gains or gambling speculations they who are dazzled by the application of physical science to the useful arts and indiscriminately applaud what they call the spirit of the age as manifested in this way and lastly those persons who are ever ready to step forward in what appears to them to be the cause of the poor but not always with becoming attention to particulars <\s>

<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>

<s> how vague and tame are the poet's expressions in those few local poems compared with his language when he is describing objects with which his position in life allowed him to be familiar <\s>
<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>
<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>
<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>

<s> it happens i believe that the intended railway would pass through this little property and i hope that an apology for the answer will not be thought necessary by one who enters into the strength of the feeling <\s>
<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>
<s> the nuisance was swept away when the late mr <\s>
<s> curwen became the owner of this favoured spot <\s>
<s> english was followed by mr <\s>
<s> pocklington a native of nottinghamshire who played strange pranks by his buildings and plantations upon vicar's island in derwent water which his admiration such as it was of the country and probably a wish to be a leader in a new fashion had tempted him to purchase <\s>
<s> but what has all this to do with the subject why to show that a vivid perception of romantic scenery is neither inherent in mankind nor a necessary consequence of even a comprehensive education <\s>
<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>
<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>
<s> the wall was backed by a bank of earth and was exquisitely decorated with ivy flowers moss and ferns such as grow of themselves in like places but the mere notion of fitness associated with a trim garden wall prevented in this instance all sense of the spontaneous bounty and delicate care of nature <\s>
<s> in the midst of a small pleasure ground immediately below my house rises a detached rock equally remarkable for the beauty of its form the ancient oaks that grow out of it and the flowers and shrubs which adorn it <\s>
<s> what a nice place would this be said a manchester tradesman pointing to the rock if that ugly lump were but out of the way <\s>
<s> men as little advanced in the pleasure which such objects give to others are so far from being rare that they may be said fairly to represent a large majority of mankind <\s>
<s> this is a fact and none but the deceiver and the willingly deceived can be offended by its being stated <\s>
<s> but as a more susceptible taste is undoubtedly a great acquisition and has been spreading among us for some years the question is what means are most likely to be beneficial in extending its operation <\s>
<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>

<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>

<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>

<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>

<s> it happens i believe that the intended railway would pass through this little property and i hope that an apology for the answer will not be thought necessary by one who enters into the strength of the feeling <\s>
<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>

<s> it happens i believe that the intended railway would pass through this little property and i hope that an apology for the answer will not be thought necessary by one who enters into the strength of the feeling <\s>
<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>
<s> the nuisance was swept away when the late mr <\s>
<s> curwen became the owner of this favoured spot <\s>
<s> english was followed by mr <\s>
<s> pocklington a native of nottinghamshire who played strange pranks by his buildings and plantations upon vicar's island in derwent water which his admiration such as it was of the country and probably a wish to be a leader in a new fashion had tempted him to purchase <\s>
<s> but what has all this to do with the subject why to show that a vivid perception of romantic scenery is neither inherent in mankind nor a necessary consequence of even a comprehensive education <\s>
<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>
<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>
<s> the wall was backed by a bank of earth and was exquisitely decorated with ivy flowers moss and ferns such as grow of themselves in like places but the mere notion of fitness associated with a trim garden wall prevented in this instance all sense of the spontaneous bounty and delicate care of nature <\s>
<s> in the midst of a small pleasure ground immediately below my house rises a detached rock equally remarkable for the beauty of its form the ancient oaks that grow out of it and the flowers and shrubs which adorn it <\s>
<s> what a nice place would this be said a manchester tradesman pointing to the rock if that ugly lump were but out of the way <\s>
<s> men as little advanced in the pleasure which such objects give to others are so far from being rare that they may be said fairly to represent a large majority of mankind <\s>
<s> this is a fact and none but the deceiver and the willingly deceived can be offended by its being stated <\s>
<s> but as a more susceptible taste is undoubtedly a great acquisition and has been spreading among us for some years the question is what means are most likely to be beneficial in extending its operation <\s>
<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>
<s> for further illustration of the subject turn to what we know of a man of extraordinary genius who was bred to hard labour in agricultural employments burns the poet <\s>
<s> when he had become distinguished by the publication of a volume of verses and was enabled to travel by the profit his poems brought him he made a tour in the course of which as his companion dr <\s>
<s> adair tells us he visited scenes inferior to none in scotland in beauty sublimity and romantic interest and the doctor having noticed with other companions that he seemed little moved upon one occasion by the sight of such a scene says 'i doubt if he had much taste for the picturesque <\s>
<s> the personal testimony however upon this point is conflicting but when dr <\s>
<s> currie refers to certain local poems as decisive proofs that burns fellow traveller was mistaken the biographer is surely unfortunate <\s>
<s> how vague and tame are the poet's expressions in those few local poems compared with his language when he is describing objects with which his position in life allowed him to be familiar <\s>
<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>
<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>
<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>
<s> the wide spread waters of these regions are in their nature peaceful so are the steep mountains and the rocky glens nor can they be profitably enjoyed but by a mind disposed to peace <\s>
<s> go to a pantomime a farce or a puppet show if you want noisy pleasure the crowd of spectators who partake your enjoyment will by their presence and acclamations enhance it but may those who have given proof that they prefer other gratifications continue to be safe from the molestation of cheap trains pouring out their hundreds at a time along the margin of windermere nor let any one be liable to the charge of being selfishly disregardful of the poor and their innocent and salutary enjoyments if he does not congratulate himself upon the especial benefit which would thus be conferred on such a concourse <\s>
<s> o nature a thy shows an forms to feeling pensive hearts hae charms <\s>
<s> so exclaimed the ayrshire ploughman speaking of ordinary rural nature under the varying influences of the seasons and the sentiment has found an echo in the bosoms of thousands in as humble a condition as he himself was when he gave vent to it <\s>
<s> but then they were feeling pensive hearts men who would be among the first to lament the facility with which they had approached this region by a sacrifice of so much of its quiet and beauty as from the intrusion of a railway would be inseparable <\s>
<s> what can in truth be more absurd than that either rich or poor should be spared the trouble of travelling by the high roads over so short a space according to their respective means if the unavoidable consequence must be a great disturbance of the retirement and in many places a destruction of the beauty of the country which the parties are come in search of <\s>
<s> would not this be pretty much like the child's cutting up his drum to learn where the sound came from <\s>
<s> having i trust given sufficient reason for the belief that the imperfectly educated classes are not likely to draw much good from rare visits to the lakes performed in this way and surely on their own account it is not desirable that the visits should be frequent let us glance at the mischief which such facilities would certainly produce <\s>
<s> the directors of railway companies are always ready to devise or encourage entertainments for tempting the humbler classes to leave their homes <\s>
<s> accordingly for the profit of the shareholders and that of the lower class of innkeepers we should have wrestling matches horse and boat races without number and pot houses and beer shops would keep pace with these excitements and recreations most of which might too easily be had elsewhere <\s>
<s> the injury which would thus be done to morals both among this influx of strangers and the lower class of inhabitants is obvious and supposing such extraordinary temptations not to be held out there cannot be a doubt that the sabbath day in the towns of bowness and ambleside and other parts of the district would be subject to much additional desecration <\s>
<s> whatever comes of the scheme which we have endeavoured to discountenance the charge against its opponents of being selfishly regardless of the poor ought to cease <\s>
<s> the cry has been raised and kept up by three classes of persons they who wish to bring into discredit all such as stand in the way of their gains or gambling speculations they who are dazzled by the application of physical science to the useful arts and indiscriminately applaud what they call the spirit of the age as manifested in this way and lastly those persons who are ever ready to step forward in what appears to them to be the cause of the poor but not always with becoming attention to particulars <\s>
<s> i am well aware that upon the first class what has been said will be of no avail but upon the two latter some impression will i trust be made <\s>
<s> the railway power we know well will not admit of being materially counteracted by sentiment and who would wish it where large towns are connected and the interests of trade and agriculture are substantially promoted by such mode of intercommunication <\s>
<s> but be it remembered that this case is as has been said before a peculiar one and that the staple of the country is its beauty and its character of retirement <\s>
<s> let then the beauty be undisfigured and the retirement unviolated unless there be reason for believing that rights and interests of a higher kind and more apparent than those which have been urged in behalf of the projected intrusion will compensate the sacrifice <\s>
<s> thanking you for the judicious observations that have appeared in your paper upon the subject of railways i remain sir your obliged wm <\s>
<s> note to the instances named in this letter of the indifference even of men of genius to the sublime forms of nature in mountainous districts the author of the interesting essays in the morning post entitled table talk has justly added goldsmith and i give the passage in his own words <\s>
<s> the simple and gentle hearted goldsmith who had an exquisite sense of rural beauty in the familiar forms of hill and dale and meadows with their hawthorn scented hedges does not seem to have dreamt of any such thing as beauty in the swiss alps though he traversed them on foot and had therefore the best opportunities of observing them <\s>

<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>
<s> the nuisance was swept away when the late mr <\s>
<s> curwen became the owner of this favoured spot <\s>
<s> english was followed by mr <\s>
<s> pocklington a native of nottinghamshire who played strange pranks by his buildings and plantations upon vicar's island in derwent water which his admiration such as it was of the country and probably a wish to be a leader in a new fashion had tempted him to purchase <\s>
<s> but what has all this to do with the subject why to show that a vivid perception of romantic scenery is neither inherent in mankind nor a necessary consequence of even a comprehensive education <\s>
<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>
<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>
<s> the wall was backed by a bank of earth and was exquisitely decorated with ivy flowers moss and ferns such as grow of themselves in like places but the mere notion of fitness associated with a trim garden wall prevented in this instance all sense of the spontaneous bounty and delicate care of nature <\s>
<s> in the midst of a small pleasure ground immediately below my house rises a detached rock equally remarkable for the beauty of its form the ancient oaks that grow out of it and the flowers and shrubs which adorn it <\s>
<s> what a nice place would this be said a manchester tradesman pointing to the rock if that ugly lump were but out of the way <\s>
<s> men as little advanced in the pleasure which such objects give to others are so far from being rare that they may be said fairly to represent a large majority of mankind <\s>
<s> this is a fact and none but the deceiver and the willingly deceived can be offended by its being stated <\s>
<s> but as a more susceptible taste is undoubtedly a great acquisition and has been spreading among us for some years the question is what means are most likely to be beneficial in extending its operation <\s>
<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>
<s> for further illustration of the subject turn to what we know of a man of extraordinary genius who was bred to hard labour in agricultural employments burns the poet <\s>
<s> when he had become distinguished by the publication of a volume of verses and was enabled to travel by the profit his poems brought him he made a tour in the course of which as his companion dr <\s>
<s> adair tells us he visited scenes inferior to none in scotland in beauty sublimity and romantic interest and the doctor having noticed with other companions that he seemed little moved upon one occasion by the sight of such a scene says 'i doubt if he had much taste for the picturesque <\s>
<s> the personal testimony however upon this point is conflicting but when dr <\s>
<s> currie refers to certain local poems as decisive proofs that burns fellow traveller was mistaken the biographer is surely unfortunate <\s>
<s> how vague and tame are the poet's expressions in those few local poems compared with his language when he is describing objects with which his position in life allowed him to be familiar <\s>
<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>

<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>

<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>
<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>
<s> the wall was backed by a bank of earth and was exquisitely decorated with ivy flowers moss and ferns such as grow of themselves in like places but the mere notion of fitness associated with a trim garden wall prevented in this instance all sense of the spontaneous bounty and delicate care of nature <\s>
<s> in the midst of a small pleasure ground immediately below my house rises a detached rock equally remarkable for the beauty of its form the ancient oaks that grow out of it and the flowers and shrubs which adorn it <\s>

<s> but as a more susceptible taste is undoubtedly a great acquisition and has been spreading among us for some years the question is what means are most likely to be beneficial in extending its operation <\s>
<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>

<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>
<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>
<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>

<s> rydal mount october 12th 1844 <\s>
<s> the degree and kind of attachment which many of the yeomanry feel to their small inheritances can scarcely be over rated <\s>
<s> near the house of one of them stands a magnificent tree which a neighbour of the owner advised him to fell for profit's sake <\s>
<s> fell it exclaimed the yeoman i had rather fall on my knees and worship it <\s>
<s> it happens i believe that the intended railway would pass through this little property and i hope that an apology for the answer will not be thought necessary by one who enters into the strength of the feeling <\s>
<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>

<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>
<s> the nuisance was swept away when the late mr <\s>
<s> curwen became the owner of this favoured spot <\s>
<s> english was followed by mr <\s>
<s> pocklington a native of nottinghamshire who played strange pranks by his buildings and plantations upon vicar's island in derwent water which his admiration such as it was of the country and probably a wish to be a leader in a new fashion had tempted him to purchase <\s>
<s> but what has all this to do with the subject why to show that a vivid perception of romantic scenery is neither inherent in mankind nor a necessary consequence of even a comprehensive education <\s>
<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>
<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>
<s> the wall was backed by a bank of earth and was exquisitely decorated with ivy flowers moss and ferns such as grow of themselves in like places but the mere notion of fitness associated with a trim garden wall prevented in this instance all sense of the spontaneous bounty and delicate care of nature <\s>
<s> in the midst of a small pleasure ground immediately below my house rises a detached rock equally remarkable for the beauty of its form the ancient oaks that grow out of it and the flowers and shrubs which adorn it <\s>
<s> what a nice place would this be said a manchester tradesman pointing to the rock if that ugly lump were but out of the way <\s>
<s> men as little advanced in the pleasure which such objects give to others are so far from being rare that they may be said fairly to represent a large majority of mankind <\s>
<s> this is a fact and none but the deceiver and the willingly deceived can be offended by its being stated <\s>
<s> but as a more susceptible taste is undoubtedly a great acquisition and has been spreading among us for some years the question is what means are most likely to be beneficial in extending its operation <\s>
<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>
<s> for further illustration of the subject turn to what we know of a man of extraordinary genius who was bred to hard labour in agricultural employments burns the poet <\s>
<s> when he had become distinguished by the publication of a volume of verses and was enabled to travel by the profit his poems brought him he made a tour in the course of which as his companion dr <\s>
<s> adair tells us he visited scenes inferior to none in scotland in beauty sublimity and romantic interest and the doctor having noticed with other companions that he seemed little moved upon one occasion by the sight of such a scene says 'i doubt if he had much taste for the picturesque <\s>
<s> the personal testimony however upon this point is conflicting but when dr <\s>
<s> currie refers to certain local poems as decisive proofs that burns fellow traveller was mistaken the biographer is surely unfortunate <\s>
<s> how vague and tame are the poet's expressions in those few local poems compared with his language when he is describing objects with which his position in life allowed him to be familiar <\s>
<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>
<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>
<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>
<s> the wide spread waters of these regions are in their nature peaceful so are the steep mountains and the rocky glens nor can they be profitably enjoyed but by a mind disposed to peace <\s>
<s> go to a pantomime a farce or a puppet show if you want noisy pleasure the crowd of spectators who partake your enjoyment will by their presence and acclamations enhance it but may those who have given proof that they prefer other gratifications continue to be safe from the molestation of cheap trains pouring out their hundreds at a time along the margin of windermere nor let any one be liable to the charge of being selfishly disregardful of the poor and their innocent and salutary enjoyments if he does not congratulate himself upon the especial benefit which would thus be conferred on such a concourse <\s>
<s> o nature a thy shows an forms to feeling pensive hearts hae charms <\s>
<s> so exclaimed the ayrshire ploughman speaking of ordinary rural nature under the varying influences of the seasons and the sentiment has found an echo in the bosoms of thousands in as humble a condition as he himself was when he gave vent to it <\s>
<s> but then they were feeling pensive hearts men who would be among the first to lament the facility with which they had approached this region by a sacrifice of so much of its quiet and beauty as from the intrusion of a railway would be inseparable <\s>
<s> what can in truth be more absurd than that either rich or poor should be spared the trouble of travelling by the high roads over so short a space according to their respective means if the unavoidable consequence must be a great disturbance of the retirement and in many places a destruction of the beauty of the country which the parties are come in search of <\s>
<s> would not this be pretty much like the child's cutting up his drum to learn where the sound came from <\s>
<s> having i trust given sufficient reason for the belief that the imperfectly educated classes are not likely to draw much good from rare visits to the lakes performed in this way and surely on their own account it is not desirable that the visits should be frequent let us glance at the mischief which such facilities would certainly produce <\s>
<s> the directors of railway companies are always ready to devise or encourage entertainments for tempting the humbler classes to leave their homes <\s>
<s> accordingly for the profit of the shareholders and that of the lower class of innkeepers we should have wrestling matches horse and boat races without number and pot houses and beer shops would keep pace with these excitements and recreations most of which might too easily be had elsewhere <\s>
<s> the injury which would thus be done to morals both among this influx of strangers and the lower class of inhabitants is obvious and supposing such extraordinary temptations not to be held out there cannot be a doubt that the sabbath day in the towns of bowness and ambleside and other parts of the district would be subject to much additional desecration <\s>
<s> whatever comes of the scheme which we have endeavoured to discountenance the charge against its opponents of being selfishly regardless of the poor ought to cease <\s>
<s> the cry has been raised and kept up by three classes of persons they who wish to bring into discredit all such as stand in the way of their gains or gambling speculations they who are dazzled by the application of physical science to the useful arts and indiscriminately applaud what they call the spirit of the age as manifested in this way and lastly those persons who are ever ready to step forward in what appears to them to be the cause of the poor but not always with becoming attention to particulars <\s>
<s> i am well aware that upon the first class what has been said will be of no avail but upon the two latter some impression will i trust be made <\s>
<s> the railway power we know well will not admit of being materially counteracted by sentiment and who would wish it where large towns are connected and the interests of trade and agriculture are substantially promoted by such mode of intercommunication <\s>
<s> but be it remembered that this case is as has been said before a peculiar one and that the staple of the country is its beauty and its character of retirement <\s>
<s> let then the beauty be undisfigured and the retirement unviolated unless there be reason for believing that rights and interests of a higher kind and more apparent than those which have been urged in behalf of the projected intrusion will compensate the sacrifice <\s>

<s> it happens i believe that the intended railway would pass through this little property and i hope that an apology for the answer will not be thought necessary by one who enters into the strength of the feeling <\s>
<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>
<s> the nuisance was swept away when the late mr <\s>
<s> curwen became the owner of this favoured spot <\s>
<s> english was followed by mr <\s>
<s> pocklington a native of nottinghamshire who played strange pranks by his buildings and plantations upon vicar's island in derwent water which his admiration such as it was of the country and probably a wish to be a leader in a new fashion had tempted him to purchase <\s>
<s> but what has all this to do with the subject why to show that a vivid perception of romantic scenery is neither inherent in mankind nor a necessary consequence of even a comprehensive education <\s>
<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>
<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>
<s> the wall was backed by a bank of earth and was exquisitely decorated with ivy flowers moss and ferns such as grow of themselves in like places but the mere notion of fitness associated with a trim garden wall prevented in this instance all sense of the spontaneous bounty and delicate care of nature <\s>
<s> in the midst of a small pleasure ground immediately below my house rises a detached rock equally remarkable for the beauty of its form the ancient oaks that grow out of it and the flowers and shrubs which adorn it <\s>
<s> what a nice place would this be said a manchester tradesman pointing to the rock if that ugly lump were but out of the way <\s>
<s> men as little advanced in the pleasure which such objects give to others are so far from being rare that they may be said fairly to represent a large majority of mankind <\s>
<s> this is a fact and none but the deceiver and the willingly deceived can be offended by its being stated <\s>
<s> but as a more susceptible taste is undoubtedly a great acquisition and has been spreading among us for some years the question is what means are most likely to be beneficial in extending its operation <\s>
<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>
<s> for further illustration of the subject turn to what we know of a man of extraordinary genius who was bred to hard labour in agricultural employments burns the poet <\s>
<s> when he had become distinguished by the publication of a volume of verses and was enabled to travel by the profit his poems brought him he made a tour in the course of which as his companion dr <\s>
<s> adair tells us he visited scenes inferior to none in scotland in beauty sublimity and romantic interest and the doctor having noticed with other companions that he seemed little moved upon one occasion by the sight of such a scene says 'i doubt if he had much taste for the picturesque <\s>
<s> the personal testimony however upon this point is conflicting but when dr <\s>
<s> currie refers to certain local poems as decisive proofs that burns fellow traveller was mistaken the biographer is surely unfortunate <\s>
<s> how vague and tame are the poet's expressions in those few local poems compared with his language when he is describing objects with which his position in life allowed him to be familiar <\s>
<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>
<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>
<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>
<s> the wide spread waters of these regions are in their nature peaceful so are the steep mountains and the rocky glens nor can they be profitably enjoyed but by a mind disposed to peace <\s>
<s> go to a pantomime a farce or a puppet show if you want noisy pleasure the crowd of spectators who partake your enjoyment will by their presence and acclamations enhance it but may those who have given proof that they prefer other gratifications continue to be safe from the molestation of cheap trains pouring out their hundreds at a time along the margin of windermere nor let any one be liable to the charge of being selfishly disregardful of the poor and their innocent and salutary enjoyments if he does not congratulate himself upon the especial benefit which would thus be conferred on such a concourse <\s>
<s> o nature a thy shows an forms to feeling pensive hearts hae charms <\s>
<s> so exclaimed the ayrshire ploughman speaking of ordinary rural nature under the varying influences of the seasons and the sentiment has found an echo in the bosoms of thousands in as humble a condition as he himself was when he gave vent to it <\s>

<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>

<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>

<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>

<s> near the house of one of them stands a magnificent tree which a neighbour of the owner advised him to fell for profit's sake <\s>
<s> fell it exclaimed the yeoman i had rather fall on my knees and worship it <\s>
<s> it happens i believe that the intended railway would pass through this little property and i hope that an apology for the answer will not be thought necessary by one who enters into the strength of the feeling <\s>
<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>
<s> the nuisance was swept away when the late mr <\s>
<s> curwen became the owner of this favoured spot <\s>
<s> english was followed by mr <\s>
<s> pocklington a native of nottinghamshire who played strange pranks by his buildings and plantations upon vicar's island in derwent water which his admiration such as it was of the country and probably a wish to be a leader in a new fashion had tempted him to purchase <\s>
<s> but what has all this to do with the subject why to show that a vivid perception of romantic scenery is neither inherent in mankind nor a necessary consequence of even a comprehensive education <\s>
<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>

<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>

<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>

<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>

<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>

<s> how vague and tame are the poet's expressions in those few local poems compared with his language when he is describing objects with which his position in life allowed him to be familiar <\s>
<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>
<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>
<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>

<s> would not this be pretty much like the child's cutting up his drum to learn where the sound came from <\s>

<s> whatever comes of the scheme which we have endeavoured to discountenance the charge against its opponents of being selfishly regardless of the poor ought to cease <\s>
<s> the cry has been raised and kept up by three classes of persons they who wish to bring into discredit all such as stand in the way of their gains or gambling speculations they who are dazzled by the application of physical science to the useful arts and indiscriminately applaud what they call the spirit of the age as manifested in this way and lastly those persons who are ever ready to step forward in what appears to them to be the cause of the poor but not always with becoming attention to particulars <\s>
<s> i am well aware that upon the first class what has been said will be of no avail but upon the two latter some impression will i trust be made <\s>

<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>

<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>
<s> the nuisance was swept away when the late mr <\s>
<s> curwen became the owner of this favoured spot <\s>
<s> english was followed by mr <\s>
<s> pocklington a native of nottinghamshire who played strange pranks by his buildings and plantations upon vicar's island in derwent water which his admiration such as it was of the country and probably a wish to be a leader in a new fashion had tempted him to purchase <\s>
<s> but what has all this to do with the subject why to show that a vivid perception of romantic scenery is neither inherent in mankind nor a necessary consequence of even a comprehensive education <\s>
<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>
<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>
<s> the wall was backed by a bank of earth and was exquisitely decorated with ivy flowers moss and ferns such as grow of themselves in like places but the mere notion of fitness associated with a trim garden wall prevented in this instance all sense of the spontaneous bounty and delicate care of nature <\s>
<s> in the midst of a small pleasure ground immediately below my house rises a detached rock equally remarkable for the beauty of its form the ancient oaks that grow out of it and the flowers and shrubs which adorn it <\s>
<s> what a nice place would this be said a manchester tradesman pointing to the rock if that ugly lump were but out of the way <\s>
<s> men as little advanced in the pleasure which such objects give to others are so far from being rare that they may be said fairly to represent a large majority of mankind <\s>
<s> this is a fact and none but the deceiver and the willingly deceived can be offended by its being stated <\s>
<s> but as a more susceptible taste is undoubtedly a great acquisition and has been spreading among us for some years the question is what means are most likely to be beneficial in extending its operation <\s>
<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>
<s> for further illustration of the subject turn to what we know of a man of extraordinary genius who was bred to hard labour in agricultural employments burns the poet <\s>
<s> when he had become distinguished by the publication of a volume of verses and was enabled to travel by the profit his poems brought him he made a tour in the course of which as his companion dr <\s>
<s> adair tells us he visited scenes inferior to none in scotland in beauty sublimity and romantic interest and the doctor having noticed with other companions that he seemed little moved upon one occasion by the sight of such a scene says 'i doubt if he had much taste for the picturesque <\s>
<s> the personal testimony however upon this point is conflicting but when dr <\s>
<s> currie refers to certain local poems as decisive proofs that burns fellow traveller was mistaken the biographer is surely unfortunate <\s>
<s> how vague and tame are the poet's expressions in those few local poems compared with his language when he is describing objects with which his position in life allowed him to be familiar <\s>
<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>
<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>
<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>
<s> the wide spread waters of these regions are in their nature peaceful so are the steep mountains and the rocky glens nor can they be profitably enjoyed but by a mind disposed to peace <\s>
<s> go to a pantomime a farce or a puppet show if you want noisy pleasure the crowd of spectators who partake your enjoyment will by their presence and acclamations enhance it but may those who have given proof that they prefer other gratifications continue to be safe from the molestation of cheap trains pouring out their hundreds at a time along the margin of windermere nor let any one be liable to the charge of being selfishly disregardful of the poor and their innocent and salutary enjoyments if he does not congratulate himself upon the especial benefit which would thus be conferred on such a concourse <\s>
<s> o nature a thy shows an forms to feeling pensive hearts hae charms <\s>
<s> so exclaimed the ayrshire ploughman speaking of ordinary rural nature under the varying influences of the seasons and the sentiment has found an echo in the bosoms of thousands in as humble a condition as he himself was when he gave vent to it <\s>
<s> but then they were feeling pensive hearts men who would be among the first to lament the facility with which they had approached this region by a sacrifice of so much of its quiet and beauty as from the intrusion of a railway would be inseparable <\s>
<s> what can in truth be more absurd than that either rich or poor should be spared the trouble of travelling by the high roads over so short a space according to their respective means if the unavoidable consequence must be a great disturbance of the retirement and in many places a destruction of the beauty of the country which the parties are come in search of <\s>
<s> would not this be pretty much like the child's cutting up his drum to learn where the sound came from <\s>
<s> having i trust given sufficient reason for the belief that the imperfectly educated classes are not likely to draw much good from rare visits to the lakes performed in this way and surely on their own account it is not desirable that the visits should be frequent let us glance at the mischief which such facilities would certainly produce <\s>
<s> the directors of railway companies are always ready to devise or encourage entertainments for tempting the humbler classes to leave their homes <\s>
<s> accordingly for the profit of the shareholders and that of the lower class of innkeepers we should have wrestling matches horse and boat races without number and pot houses and beer shops would keep pace with these excitements and recreations most of which might too easily be had elsewhere <\s>
<s> the injury which would thus be done to morals both among this influx of strangers and the lower class of inhabitants is obvious and supposing such extraordinary temptations not to be held out there cannot be a doubt that the sabbath day in the towns of bowness and ambleside and other parts of the district would be subject to much additional desecration <\s>
<s> whatever comes of the scheme which we have endeavoured to discountenance the charge against its opponents of being selfishly regardless of the poor ought to cease <\s>
<s> the cry has been raised and kept up by three classes of persons they who wish to bring into discredit all such as stand in the way of their gains or gambling speculations they who are dazzled by the application of physical science to the useful arts and indiscriminately applaud what they call the spirit of the age as manifested in this way and lastly those persons who are ever ready to step forward in what appears to them to be the cause of the poor but not always with becoming attention to particulars <\s>

<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>

<s> how vague and tame are the poet's expressions in those few local poems compared with his language when he is describing objects with which his position in life allowed him to be familiar <\s>
<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>
<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>
<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>

<s> it happens i believe that the intended railway would pass through this little property and i hope that an apology for the answer will not be thought necessary by one who enters into the strength of the feeling <\s>
<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>
<s> the nuisance was swept away when the late mr <\s>
<s> curwen became the owner of this favoured spot <\s>
<s> english was followed by mr <\s>
<s> pocklington a native of nottinghamshire who played strange pranks by his buildings and plantations upon vicar's island in derwent water which his admiration such as it was of the country and probably a wish to be a leader in a new fashion had tempted him to purchase <\s>
<s> but what has all this to do with the subject why to show that a vivid perception of romantic scenery is neither inherent in mankind nor a necessary consequence of even a comprehensive education <\s>
<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>
<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>
<s> the wall was backed by a bank of earth and was exquisitely decorated with ivy flowers moss and ferns such as grow of themselves in like places but the mere notion of fitness associated with a trim garden wall prevented in this instance all sense of the spontaneous bounty and delicate care of nature <\s>
<s> in the midst of a small pleasure ground immediately below my house rises a detached rock equally remarkable for the beauty of its form the ancient oaks that grow out of it and the flowers and shrubs which adorn it <\s>
<s> what a nice place would this be said a manchester tradesman pointing to the rock if that ugly lump were but out of the way <\s>
<s> men as little advanced in the pleasure which such objects give to others are so far from being rare that they may be said fairly to represent a large majority of mankind <\s>
<s> this is a fact and none but the deceiver and the willingly deceived can be offended by its being stated <\s>
<s> but as a more susceptible taste is undoubtedly a great acquisition and has been spreading among us for some years the question is what means are most likely to be beneficial in extending its operation <\s>
<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>

<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>

<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>

<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>

<s> it happens i believe that the intended railway would pass through this little property and i hope that an apology for the answer will not be thought necessary by one who enters into the strength of the feeling <\s>
<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>

<s> it happens i believe that the intended railway would pass through this little property and i hope that an apology for the answer will not be thought necessary by one who enters into the strength of the feeling <\s>
<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>
<s> the nuisance was swept away when the late mr <\s>
<s> curwen became the owner of this favoured spot <\s>
<s> english was followed by mr <\s>
<s> pocklington a native of nottinghamshire who played strange pranks by his buildings and plantations upon vicar's island in derwent water which his admiration such as it was of the country and probably a wish to be a leader in a new fashion had tempted him to purchase <\s>
<s> but what has all this to do with the subject why to show that a vivid perception of romantic scenery is neither inherent in mankind nor a necessary consequence of even a comprehensive education <\s>
<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>
<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>
<s> the wall was backed by a bank of earth and was exquisitely decorated with ivy flowers moss and ferns such as grow of themselves in like places but the mere notion of fitness associated with a trim garden wall prevented in this instance all sense of the spontaneous bounty and delicate care of nature <\s>
<s> in the midst of a small pleasure ground immediately below my house rises a detached rock equally remarkable for the beauty of its form the ancient oaks that grow out of it and the flowers and shrubs which adorn it <\s>
<s> what a nice place would this be said a manchester tradesman pointing to the rock if that ugly lump were but out of the way <\s>
<s> men as little advanced in the pleasure which such objects give to others are so far from being rare that they may be said fairly to represent a large majority of mankind <\s>
<s> this is a fact and none but the deceiver and the willingly deceived can be offended by its being stated <\s>
<s> but as a more susceptible taste is undoubtedly a great acquisition and has been spreading among us for some years the question is what means are most likely to be beneficial in extending its operation <\s>
<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>
<s> for further illustration of the subject turn to what we know of a man of extraordinary genius who was bred to hard labour in agricultural employments burns the poet <\s>
<s> when he had become distinguished by the publication of a volume of verses and was enabled to travel by the profit his poems brought him he made a tour in the course of which as his companion dr <\s>
<s> adair tells us he visited scenes inferior to none in scotland in beauty sublimity and romantic interest and the doctor having noticed with other companions that he seemed little moved upon one occasion by the sight of such a scene says 'i doubt if he had much taste for the picturesque <\s>
<s> the personal testimony however upon this point is conflicting but when dr <\s>
<s> currie refers to certain local poems as decisive proofs that burns fellow traveller was mistaken the biographer is surely unfortunate <\s>
<s> how vague and tame are the poet's expressions in those few local poems compared with his language when he is describing objects with which his position in life allowed him to be familiar <\s>
<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>
<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>
<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>
<s> the wide spread waters of these regions are in their nature peaceful so are the steep mountains and the rocky glens nor can they be profitably enjoyed but by a mind disposed to peace <\s>
<s> go to a pantomime a farce or a puppet show if you want noisy pleasure the crowd of spectators who partake your enjoyment will by their presence and acclamations enhance it but may those who have given proof that they prefer other gratifications continue to be safe from the molestation of cheap trains pouring out their hundreds at a time along the margin of windermere nor let any one be liable to the charge of being selfishly disregardful of the poor and their innocent and salutary enjoyments if he does not congratulate himself upon the especial benefit which would thus be conferred on such a concourse <\s>
<s> o nature a thy shows an forms to feeling pensive hearts hae charms <\s>
<s> so exclaimed the ayrshire ploughman speaking of ordinary rural nature under the varying influences of the seasons and the sentiment has found an echo in the bosoms of thousands in as humble a condition as he himself was when he gave vent to it <\s>
<s> but then they were feeling pensive hearts men who would be among the first to lament the facility with which they had approached this region by a sacrifice of so much of its quiet and beauty as from the intrusion of a railway would be inseparable <\s>
<s> what can in truth be more absurd than that either rich or poor should be spared the trouble of travelling by the high roads over so short a space according to their respective means if the unavoidable consequence must be a great disturbance of the retirement and in many places a destruction of the beauty of the country which the parties are come in search of <\s>
<s> would not this be pretty much like the child's cutting up his drum to learn where the sound came from <\s>
<s> having i trust given sufficient reason for the belief that the imperfectly educated classes are not likely to draw much good from rare visits to the lakes performed in this way and surely on their own account it is not desirable that the visits should be frequent let us glance at the mischief which such facilities would certainly produce <\s>
<s> the directors of railway companies are always ready to devise or encourage entertainments for tempting the humbler classes to leave their homes <\s>
<s> accordingly for the profit of the shareholders and that of the lower class of innkeepers we should have wrestling matches horse and boat races without number and pot houses and beer shops would keep pace with these excitements and recreations most of which might too easily be had elsewhere <\s>
<s> the injury which would thus be done to morals both among this influx of strangers and the lower class of inhabitants is obvious and supposing such extraordinary temptations not to be held out there cannot be a doubt that the sabbath day in the towns of bowness and ambleside and other parts of the district would be subject to much additional desecration <\s>
<s> whatever comes of the scheme which we have endeavoured to discountenance the charge against its opponents of being selfishly regardless of the poor ought to cease <\s>
<s> the cry has been raised and kept up by three classes of persons they who wish to bring into discredit all such as stand in the way of their gains or gambling speculations they who are dazzled by the application of physical science to the useful arts and indiscriminately applaud what they call the spirit of the age as manifested in this way and lastly those persons who are ever ready to step forward in what appears to them to be the cause of the poor but not always with becoming attention to particulars <\s>
<s> i am well aware that upon the first class what has been said will be of no avail but upon the two latter some impression will i trust be made <\s>
<s> the railway power we know well will not admit of being materially counteracted by sentiment and who would wish it where large towns are connected and the interests of trade and agriculture are substantially promoted by such mode of intercommunication <\s>
<s> but be it remembered that this case is as has been said before a peculiar one and that the staple of the country is its beauty and its character of retirement <\s>
<s> let then the beauty be undisfigured and the retirement unviolated unless there be reason for believing that rights and interests of a higher kind and more apparent than those which have been urged in behalf of the projected intrusion will compensate the sacrifice <\s>
<s> thanking you for the judicious observations that have appeared in your paper upon the subject of railways i remain sir your obliged wm <\s>
<s> note to the instances named in this letter of the indifference even of men of genius to the sublime forms of nature in mountainous districts the author of the interesting essays in the morning post entitled table talk has justly added goldsmith and i give the passage in his own words <\s>
<s> the simple and gentle hearted goldsmith who had an exquisite sense of rural beauty in the familiar forms of hill and dale and meadows with their hawthorn scented hedges does not seem to have dreamt of any such thing as beauty in the swiss alps though he traversed them on foot and had therefore the best opportunities of observing them <\s>

<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>
<s> the nuisance was swept away when the late mr <\s>
<s> curwen became the owner of this favoured spot <\s>
<s> english was followed by mr <\s>
<s> pocklington a native of nottinghamshire who played strange pranks by his buildings and plantations upon vicar's island in derwent water which his admiration such as it was of the country and probably a wish to be a leader in a new fashion had tempted him to purchase <\s>
<s> but what has all this to do with the subject why to show that a vivid perception of romantic scenery is neither inherent in mankind nor a necessary consequence of even a comprehensive education <\s>
<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>
<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>
<s> the wall was backed by a bank of earth and was exquisitely decorated with ivy flowers moss and ferns such as grow of themselves in like places but the mere notion of fitness associated with a trim garden wall prevented in this instance all sense of the spontaneous bounty and delicate care of nature <\s>
<s> in the midst of a small pleasure ground immediately below my house rises a detached rock equally remarkable for the beauty of its form the ancient oaks that grow out of it and the flowers and shrubs which adorn it <\s>
<s> what a nice place would this be said a manchester tradesman pointing to the rock if that ugly lump were but out of the way <\s>
<s> men as little advanced in the pleasure which such objects give to others are so far from being rare that they may be said fairly to represent a large majority of mankind <\s>
<s> this is a fact and none but the deceiver and the willingly deceived can be offended by its being stated <\s>
<s> but as a more susceptible taste is undoubtedly a great acquisition and has been spreading among us for some years the question is what means are most likely to be beneficial in extending its operation <\s>
<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>
<s> for further illustration of the subject turn to what we know of a man of extraordinary genius who was bred to hard labour in agricultural employments burns the poet <\s>
<s> when he had become distinguished by the publication of a volume of verses and was enabled to travel by the profit his poems brought him he made a tour in the course of which as his companion dr <\s>
<s> adair tells us he visited scenes inferior to none in scotland in beauty sublimity and romantic interest and the doctor having noticed with other companions that he seemed little moved upon one occasion by the sight of such a scene says 'i doubt if he had much taste for the picturesque <\s>
<s> the personal testimony however upon this point is conflicting but when dr <\s>
<s> currie refers to certain local poems as decisive proofs that burns fellow traveller was mistaken the biographer is surely unfortunate <\s>
<s> how vague and tame are the poet's expressions in those few local poems compared with his language when he is describing objects with which his position in life allowed him to be familiar <\s>
<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>

<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>

<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>
<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>
<s> the wall was backed by a bank of earth and was exquisitely decorated with ivy flowers moss and ferns such as grow of themselves in like places but the mere notion of fitness associated with a trim garden wall prevented in this instance all sense of the spontaneous bounty and delicate care of nature <\s>
<s> in the midst of a small pleasure ground immediately below my house rises a detached rock equally remarkable for the beauty of its form the ancient oaks that grow out of it and the flowers and shrubs which adorn it <\s>

<s> but as a more susceptible taste is undoubtedly a great acquisition and has been spreading among us for some years the question is what means are most likely to be beneficial in extending its operation <\s>
<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>

<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>
<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>
<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>

<s> rydal mount october 12th 1844 <\s>
<s> the degree and kind of attachment which many of the yeomanry feel to their small inheritances can scarcely be over rated <\s>
<s> near the house of one of them stands a magnificent tree which a neighbour of the owner advised him to fell for profit's sake <\s>
<s> fell it exclaimed the yeoman i had rather fall on my knees and worship it <\s>
<s> it happens i believe that the intended railway would pass through this little property and i hope that an apology for the answer will not be thought necessary by one who enters into the strength of the feeling <\s>
<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>

<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>
<s> the nuisance was swept away when the late mr <\s>
<s> curwen became the owner of this favoured spot <\s>
<s> english was followed by mr <\s>
<s> pocklington a native of nottinghamshire who played strange pranks by his buildings and plantations upon vicar's island in derwent water which his admiration such as it was of the country and probably a wish to be a leader in a new fashion had tempted him to purchase <\s>
<s> but what has all this to do with the subject why to show that a vivid perception of romantic scenery is neither inherent in mankind nor a necessary consequence of even a comprehensive education <\s>
<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>
<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>
<s> the wall was backed by a bank of earth and was exquisitely decorated with ivy flowers moss and ferns such as grow of themselves in like places but the mere notion of fitness associated with a trim garden wall prevented in this instance all sense of the spontaneous bounty and delicate care of nature <\s>
<s> in the midst of a small pleasure ground immediately below my house rises a detached rock equally remarkable for the beauty of its form the ancient oaks that grow out of it and the flowers and shrubs which adorn it <\s>
<s> what a nice place would this be said a manchester tradesman pointing to the rock if that ugly lump were but out of the way <\s>
<s> men as little advanced in the pleasure which such objects give to others are so far from being rare that they may be said fairly to represent a large majority of mankind <\s>
<s> this is a fact and none but the deceiver and the willingly deceived can be offended by its being stated <\s>
<s> but as a more susceptible taste is undoubtedly a great acquisition and has been spreading among us for some years the question is what means are most likely to be beneficial in extending its operation <\s>
<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>
<s> for further illustration of the subject turn to what we know of a man of extraordinary genius who was bred to hard labour in agricultural employments burns the poet <\s>
<s> when he had become distinguished by the publication of a volume of verses and was enabled to travel by the profit his poems brought him he made a tour in the course of which as his companion dr <\s>
<s> adair tells us he visited scenes inferior to none in scotland in beauty sublimity and romantic interest and the doctor having noticed with other companions that he seemed little moved upon one occasion by the sight of such a scene says 'i doubt if he had much taste for the picturesque <\s>
<s> the personal testimony however upon this point is conflicting but when dr <\s>
<s> currie refers to certain local poems as decisive proofs that burns fellow traveller was mistaken the biographer is surely unfortunate <\s>
<s> how vague and tame are the poet's expressions in those few local poems compared with his language when he is describing objects with which his position in life allowed him to be familiar <\s>
<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>
<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>
<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>
<s> the wide spread waters of these regions are in their nature peaceful so are the steep mountains and the rocky glens nor can they be profitably enjoyed but by a mind disposed to peace <\s>
<s> go to a pantomime a farce or a puppet show if you want noisy pleasure the crowd of spectators who partake your enjoyment will by their presence and acclamations enhance it but may those who have given proof that they prefer other gratifications continue to be safe from the molestation of cheap trains pouring out their hundreds at a time along the margin of windermere nor let any one be liable to the charge of being selfishly disregardful of the poor and their innocent and salutary enjoyments if he does not congratulate himself upon the especial benefit which would thus be conferred on such a concourse <\s>
<s> o nature a thy shows an forms to feeling pensive hearts hae charms <\s>
<s> so exclaimed the ayrshire ploughman speaking of ordinary rural nature under the varying influences of the seasons and the sentiment has found an echo in the bosoms of thousands in as humble a condition as he himself was when he gave vent to it <\s>
<s> but then they were feeling pensive hearts men who would be among the first to lament the facility with which they had approached this region by a sacrifice of so much of its quiet and beauty as from the intrusion of a railway would be inseparable <\s>
<s> what can in truth be more absurd than that either rich or poor should be spared the trouble of travelling by the high roads over so short a space according to their respective means if the unavoidable consequence must be a great disturbance of the retirement and in many places a destruction of the beauty of the country which the parties are come in search of <\s>
<s> would not this be pretty much like the child's cutting up his drum to learn where the sound came from <\s>
<s> having i trust given sufficient reason for the belief that the imperfectly educated classes are not likely to draw much good from rare visits to the lakes performed in this way and surely on their own account it is not desirable that the visits should be frequent let us glance at the mischief which such facilities would certainly produce <\s>
<s> the directors of railway companies are always ready to devise or encourage entertainments for tempting the humbler classes to leave their homes <\s>
<s> accordingly for the profit of the shareholders and that of the lower class of innkeepers we should have wrestling matches horse and boat races without number and pot houses and beer shops would keep pace with these excitements and recreations most of which might too easily be had elsewhere <\s>
<s> the injury which would thus be done to morals both among this influx of strangers and the lower class of inhabitants is obvious and supposing such extraordinary temptations not to be held out there cannot be a doubt that the sabbath day in the towns of bowness and ambleside and other parts of the district would be subject to much additional desecration <\s>
<s> whatever comes of the scheme which we have endeavoured to discountenance the charge against its opponents of being selfishly regardless of the poor ought to cease <\s>
<s> the cry has been raised and kept up by three classes of persons they who wish to bring into discredit all such as stand in the way of their gains or gambling speculations they who are dazzled by the application of physical science to the useful arts and indiscriminately applaud what they call the spirit of the age as manifested in this way and lastly those persons who are ever ready to step forward in what appears to them to be the cause of the poor but not always with becoming attention to particulars <\s>
<s> i am well aware that upon the first class what has been said will be of no avail but upon the two latter some impression will i trust be made <\s>
<s> the railway power we know well will not admit of being materially counteracted by sentiment and who would wish it where large towns are connected and the interests of trade and agriculture are substantially promoted by such mode of intercommunication <\s>
<s> but be it remembered that this case is as has been said before a peculiar one and that the staple of the country is its beauty and its character of retirement <\s>
<s> let then the beauty be undisfigured and the retirement unviolated unless there be reason for believing that rights and interests of a higher kind and more apparent than those which have been urged in behalf of the projected intrusion will compensate the sacrifice <\s>

<s> it happens i believe that the intended railway would pass through this little property and i hope that an apology for the answer will not be thought necessary by one who enters into the strength of the feeling <\s>
<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>
<s> the nuisance was swept away when the late mr <\s>
<s> curwen became the owner of this favoured spot <\s>
<s> english was followed by mr <\s>
<s> pocklington a native of nottinghamshire who played strange pranks by his buildings and plantations upon vicar's island in derwent water which his admiration such as it was of the country and probably a wish to be a leader in a new fashion had tempted him to purchase <\s>
<s> but what has all this to do with the subject why to show that a vivid perception of romantic scenery is neither inherent in mankind nor a necessary consequence of even a comprehensive education <\s>
<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>
<s> in the eye of thousands and tens of thousands a rich meadow with fat cattle grazing upon it or the sight of what they would call a heavy crop of corn is worth all that the alps and pyrenees in their utmost grandeur and beauty could show to them and notwithstanding the grateful influence as we have observed of ordinary nature and the productions of the fields it is noticeable what trifling conventional prepossessions will in common minds not only preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty but will even turn it into an object of disgust <\s>
<s> if i had to do with this garden said a respectable person one of my neighbours i would sweep away all the black and dirty stuff from that wall <\s>
<s> the wall was backed by a bank of earth and was exquisitely decorated with ivy flowers moss and ferns such as grow of themselves in like places but the mere notion of fitness associated with a trim garden wall prevented in this instance all sense of the spontaneous bounty and delicate care of nature <\s>
<s> in the midst of a small pleasure ground immediately below my house rises a detached rock equally remarkable for the beauty of its form the ancient oaks that grow out of it and the flowers and shrubs which adorn it <\s>
<s> what a nice place would this be said a manchester tradesman pointing to the rock if that ugly lump were but out of the way <\s>
<s> men as little advanced in the pleasure which such objects give to others are so far from being rare that they may be said fairly to represent a large majority of mankind <\s>
<s> this is a fact and none but the deceiver and the willingly deceived can be offended by its being stated <\s>
<s> but as a more susceptible taste is undoubtedly a great acquisition and has been spreading among us for some years the question is what means are most likely to be beneficial in extending its operation <\s>
<s> surely that good is not to be obtained by transferring at once uneducated persons in large bodies to particular spots where the combinations of natural objects are such as would afford the greatest pleasure to those who have been in the habit of observing and studying the peculiar character of such scenes and how they differ one from another <\s>
<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>
<s> it is in some such way as this only that persons who must labour daily with their hands for bread in large towns or are subject to confinement through the week can be trained to a profitable intercourse with nature where she is the most distinguished by the majesty and sublimity of her forms <\s>
<s> for further illustration of the subject turn to what we know of a man of extraordinary genius who was bred to hard labour in agricultural employments burns the poet <\s>
<s> when he had become distinguished by the publication of a volume of verses and was enabled to travel by the profit his poems brought him he made a tour in the course of which as his companion dr <\s>
<s> adair tells us he visited scenes inferior to none in scotland in beauty sublimity and romantic interest and the doctor having noticed with other companions that he seemed little moved upon one occasion by the sight of such a scene says 'i doubt if he had much taste for the picturesque <\s>
<s> the personal testimony however upon this point is conflicting but when dr <\s>
<s> currie refers to certain local poems as decisive proofs that burns fellow traveller was mistaken the biographer is surely unfortunate <\s>
<s> how vague and tame are the poet's expressions in those few local poems compared with his language when he is describing objects with which his position in life allowed him to be familiar <\s>
<s> it appears both from what his works contain and from what is not to be found in them that sensitive as they abundantly prove his mind to have been in its intercourse with common rural images and with the general powers of nature exhibited in storm and in stillness in light or darkness and in the various aspects of the seasons he was little affected by the sight of one spot in preference to another unless where it derived an interest from history tradition or local associations <\s>
<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>
<s> if all this be truly said of such a man and the like cannot be denied of the eminent individuals before named who to great natural talents added the accomplishments of scholarship or science then what ground is there for maintaining that the poor are treated with disrespect or wrong done to them or any class of visitants if we be reluctant to introduce a railway into this country for the sake of lessening by eight or nine miles only the fatigue or expense of their journey to windermere and wherever any one among the labouring classes has made even an approach to the sensibility which drew a lamentation from burns when he had uprooted a daisy with his plough and caused him to turn the weeder clips aside from the thistle and spare the symbol dear of his country then surely such a one could he afford by any means to travel as far as kendal would not grudge a two hours walk across the skirts of the beautiful country that he was desirous of visiting <\s>
<s> the wide spread waters of these regions are in their nature peaceful so are the steep mountains and the rocky glens nor can they be profitably enjoyed but by a mind disposed to peace <\s>
<s> go to a pantomime a farce or a puppet show if you want noisy pleasure the crowd of spectators who partake your enjoyment will by their presence and acclamations enhance it but may those who have given proof that they prefer other gratifications continue to be safe from the molestation of cheap trains pouring out their hundreds at a time along the margin of windermere nor let any one be liable to the charge of being selfishly disregardful of the poor and their innocent and salutary enjoyments if he does not congratulate himself upon the especial benefit which would thus be conferred on such a concourse <\s>
<s> o nature a thy shows an forms to feeling pensive hearts hae charms <\s>
<s> so exclaimed the ayrshire ploughman speaking of ordinary rural nature under the varying influences of the seasons and the sentiment has found an echo in the bosoms of thousands in as humble a condition as he himself was when he gave vent to it <\s>

<s> instead of tempting artisans and labourers and the humbler classes of shopkeepers to ramble to a distance let us rather look with lively sympathy upon persons in that condition when upon a holiday or on the sunday after having attended divine worship they make little excursions with their wives and children among neighbouring fields whither the whole of each family might stroll or be conveyed at much less cost than would be required to take a single individual of the number to the shores of windermere by the cheapest conveyance <\s>

<s> he lived many years in nithsdale where he was in daily sight of skiddaw yet he never crossed the solway for a better acquaintance with that mountain and i am persuaded that if he had been induced to ramble among our lakes by that time sufficiently celebrated he would have seldom been more excited than by some ordinary scottish stream or hill with a tradition attached to it or which had been the scene of a favourite ballad or love song <\s>

<s> it happens i believe that the intended railway would pass through this little property and i hope that an apology for the answer will not be thought necessary by one who enters into the strength of the feeling <\s>
<s> kendal and windermere railway <\s>
<s> to the editor of the morning post sir some little time ago you did me the favour of inserting a sonnet expressive of the regret and indignation which in common with others all over these islands i felt at the proposal of a railway to extend from kendal to low wood near the head of windermere <\s>
<s> the project was so offensive to a large majority of the proprietors through whose lands the line after it came in view of the lake was to pass that for this reason and the avowed one of the heavy expense without which the difficulties in the way could not be overcome it has been partially abandoned and the terminus is now announced to be at a spot within a mile of bowness <\s>
<s> but as no guarantee can be given that the project will not hereafter be revived and an attempt made to carry the line forward through the vales of ambleside and grasmere and as in one main particular the case remains essentially the same allow me to address you upon certain points which merit more consideration than the favourers of the scheme have yet given them <\s>
<s> the matter though seemingly local is really one in which all persons of taste must be interested and therefore i hope to be excused if i venture to treat it at some length <\s>
<s> i shall barely touch upon the statistics of the question leaving these to the two adverse parties who will lay their several statements before the board of trade which may possibly be induced to refer the matter to the house of commons and contemplating that possibility i hope that the observations i have to make may not be altogether without influence upon the public and upon individuals whose duty it may be to decide in their place whether the proposed measure shall be referred to a committee of the house <\s>
<s> were the case before us an ordinary one i should reject such an attempt as presumptuous and futile but it is not only different from all others but in truth peculiar <\s>
<s> in this district the manufactures are trifling mines it has none and its quarries are either wrought out or superseded the soil is light and the cultivateable parts of the country are very limited so that it has little to send out and little has it also to receive <\s>
<s> summer tourists and the very word precludes the notion of a railway it has in abundance but the inhabitants are so few and their intercourse with other places so infrequent that one daily coach which could not be kept going but through its connection with the post office suffices for three fourths of the year along the line of country as far as keswick <\s>
<s> the staple of the district is in fact its beauty and its character of seclusion and retirement and to these topics and to others connected with them my remarks shall be confined <\s>
<s> the projectors have induced many to favour their schemes by declaring that one of their main objects is to place the beauties of the lake district within easier reach of those who cannot afford to pay for ordinary conveyances <\s>
<s> look at the facts <\s>
<s> railways are completed which joined with others in rapid progress will bring travellers who prefer approaching by ullswater to within four miles of that lake <\s>
<s> the lancaster and carlisle railway will approach the town of kendal about eight or nine miles from eminences that command the whole vale of windermere <\s>
<s> the lakes are therefore at present of very easy access for all persons but if they be not made still more so the poor it is said will be wronged <\s>
<s> before this be admitted let the question be fairly looked into and its different bearings examined <\s>
<s> no one can assert that if this intended mode of approach be not effected anything will be taken away that is actually possessed <\s>
<s> the wrong if any must lie in the unwarrantable obstruction of an attainable benefit <\s>
<s> first then let us consider the probable amount of that benefit <\s>
<s> elaborate gardens with topiary works were in high request even among our remote ancestors but the relish for choice and picturesque natural scenery a poor and mean word which requires an apology but will be generally understood is quite of recent origin <\s>
<s> our earlier travellers ray the naturalist one of the first men of his age bishop burnet and others who had crossed the alps or lived some time in switzerland are silent upon the sublimity and beauty of those regions and burnet even uses these words speaking of the grisons 'when they have made up estates elsewhere they are glad to leave italy and the best parts of germany and to come and live among those mountains of which the very sight is enough to fill a man with horror <\s>
<s> the accomplished evelyn giving an account of his journey from italy through the alps dilates upon the terrible the melancholy and the uncomfortable but till he comes to the fruitful country in the neighbourhood of geneva not a syllable of delight or praise <\s>
<s> in the sacra telluris theoria of the other burnet there is a passage omitted however in his own english translation of the work in which he gives utterance to his sensations when from a particular spot he beheld a tract of the alps rising before him on the one hand and on the other the mediterranean sea spread beneath him <\s>
<s> nothing can be worthier of the magnificent appearances he describes than his language <\s>
<s> in a noble strain also does the poet gray address in a latin ode the religio loci at the grande chartruise <\s>
<s> but before his time with the exception of the passage from thomas burnet just alluded to there is not i believe a single english traveller whose published writings would disprove the assertion that where precipitous rocks and mountains are mentioned at all they are spoken of as objects of dislike and fear and not of admiration <\s>
<s> even gray himself describing in his journal the steeps at the entrance of borrowdale expresses his terror in the language of dante let us not speak of them but look and pass on <\s>
<s> in my youth i lived some time in the vale of keswick under the roof of a shrewd and sensible woman who more than once exclaimed in my hearing bless me <\s>
<s> folk are always talking about prospects when i was young there was never sic a thing neamed <\s>
<s> in fact our ancestors as every where appears in choosing the site of their houses looked only at shelter and convenience especially of water and often would place a barn or any other out house directly in front of their habitations however beautiful the landscape which their windows might otherwise have commanded <\s>
<s> the first house that was built in the lake district for the sake of the beauty of the country was the work of a mr <\s>
<s> english who had travelled in italy and chose for his site some eighty years ago the great island of windermere but it was sold before his building was finished and he showed how little he was capable of appreciating the character of the situation by setting up a length of high garden wall as exclusive as it was ugly almost close to the house <\s>
<s> the nuisance was swept away when the late mr <\s>
<s> curwen became the owner of this favoured spot <\s>
<s> english was followed by mr <\s>
<s> pocklington a native of nottinghamshire who played strange pranks by his buildings and plantations upon vicar's island in derwent water which his admiration such as it was of the country and probably a wish to be a leader in a new fashion had tempted him to purchase <\s>
<s> but what has all this to do with the subject why to show that a vivid perception of romantic scenery is neither inherent in mankind nor a necessary consequence of even a comprehensive education <\s>
<s> it is benignly ordained that green fields clear blue skies running streams of pure water rich groves and woods orchards and all the ordinary varieties of rural nature should find an easy way to the affections of all men and more or less so from early childhood till the senses are impaired by old age and the sources of mere earthly enjoyment have in a great measure failed <\s>
<s> but a taste beyond this however desirable it may be that every one should possess it is not to be implanted at once it must be gradually developed both in nations and individuals <\s>
<s> rocks and mountains torrents and wide spread waters and all those features of nature which go to the composition of such scenes as this part of england is distinguished for cannot in their finer relations to the human mind be comprehended or even very imperfectly conceived without processes of culture or opportunities of observation in some degree habitual <\s>

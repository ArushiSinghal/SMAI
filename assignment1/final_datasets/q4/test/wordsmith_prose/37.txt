<s> hartley coleridge's sonnets had not been published before your collection was made as there are several well worthy of a place in it <\s>
<s> last midsummer i made a fortnight's tour in the isle of man staffa iona c which produced between thirty and forty sonnets some of which i think would please you <\s>
<s> could not you contrive to take the lakes in your way sometimes to or from scotland <\s>
<s> i need not say how glad i should be to see you for a few days <\s>
<s> what a pity that mr <\s>
<s> heber's wonderful collection of books is about to be dispersed 144 144 memoirs ii <\s>
<s> proposed dedication of poems to wordsworth <\s>
<s> rydal mount april 1834 <\s>
<s> hemans you have submitted what you intended as a dedication of your poems to me <\s>
<s> i need scarcely say that as a private letter such expressions from such a quarter could not have been received by me but with pleasure of no ordinary kind unchecked by any consideration but the fear that my writings were overrated by you and my character thought better of than it deserved <\s>
<s> but i must say that a public testimony in so high a strain of admiration is what i cannot but shrink from be this modesty true or false it is in me you must bear with it and make allowance for it <\s>
<s> and therefore as you have submitted the whole to my judgment i am emboldened to express a wish that you would instead of this dedication in which your warm and kind heart has overpowered you simply inscribe them to me with such expression of respect or gratitude as would come within the limits of the rule which after what has been said above will naturally suggest itself <\s>
<s> of course if the sheet has been struck off i must hope that my shoulders may become a little more atlantean than i now feel them to be <\s>
<s> my sister is not quite so well <\s>
<s> w and dora all unite with me in best wishes and kindest remembrances to yourself and yours and believe me dear mrs <\s>
<s> hemans to remain faithfully yours wm <\s>
<s> wordsworth 145 145 memoirs ii <\s>
<s> letter to lieutenant general sir wm <\s>
<s> rydal mount april 16 <\s>
<s> my dear sir your verses for which i sincerely thank you are an additional proof of the truth which forced from me many years ago the exclamation o many are the poets that are sown by nature 146 the rest of that paragraph also has some bearing upon your position in the poetical world <\s>
<s> the thoughts and images through both the poems and the feelings also are eminently such as become their several subjects but it would be insincerity were i to omit adding that there is here and there a want of that skill in workmanship which i believe nothing but continued practice in the art can bestow <\s>
<s> i have used the word art from a conviction which i am called upon almost daily to express that poetry is infinitely more of an art than the world is disposed to believe <\s>
<s> nor is this any dishonour to it both for the reason that the poetic faculty is not rarely bestowed and for this cause also that men would not be disposed to ascribe so much to inspiration if they did not feel how near and dear to them poetry is <\s>
<s> 146 excursion book i <\s>
<s> with sincere regards and best wishes to yourself and lady gomm believe me to be very sincerely yours w <\s>

<s> the poems of mrs <\s>
<s> hemans i avail myself gladly of the opportunity of mr <\s>
<s> graves's return to acknowledge the honour you have done me in prefixing my name to your volume of beautiful poems and to thank you for the copy you have sent me with your own autograph <\s>
<s> where there is so much to admire it is difficult to select and therefore i shall content myself with naming only two or three pieces <\s>
<s> and first let me particularise the piece that stands second in the volume flowers and music in a sick room <\s>
<s> this was especially touching to me on my poor sister's account who has long been an invalid confined almost to her chamber <\s>
<s> the feelings are sweetly touched throughout this poem and the imagery very beautiful above all in the passage where you describe the colour of the petals of the wild rose <\s>
<s> this morning i have read the stanzas upon elysium with great pleasure <\s>
<s> you have admirably expanded the thought of chateaubriand <\s>
<s> if we had not been disappointed in our expected pleasure of seeing you here i should have been tempted to speak of many other passages and poems with which i have been delighted <\s>
<s> your health i hope 148 is by this time reëstablished <\s>
<s> your son charles looks uncommonly well and we have had the pleasure of seeing him and his friends several times but as you are aware we are much engaged with visitors at this season of the year so as not always to be able to follow our inclinations as to whom we would wish to see <\s>
<s> i cannot conclude without thanking you for your sonnet upon a place so dear to me as grasmere it is worthy of the subject <\s>
<s> with kindest remembrances in which unite mrs <\s>
<s> w my sister and dora i remain dear mrs <\s>
<s> hemans your much obliged friend wm <\s>

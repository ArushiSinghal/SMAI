<s> to the south all is soft and delicious the eye reposes upon a few rich pastures a moderate reach of the river sufficiently tranquil to form a mirror to the sun and the bounding hills beyond neither too near nor too lofty to exclude even in winter any portion of his rays <\s>

<s> hutchinson at the close of the year 1807 <\s>
<s> the country is flat and the weather was rough <\s>
<s> i was accustomed every day to walk to and fro under the shelter of a row of stacks in a field at a small distance from the town and there poured forth my verses aloud as freely as they would come <\s>

<s> it may be worth while to note as a caution to others who may cast their eyes on these memoranda that the skin having been rubbed off my heel by my wearing too tight a shoe though i desisted from walking i found that the irritation of the wounded part was kept up by the act of composition to a degree that made it necessary to give my constitution a holiday <\s>
<s> a rapid cure was the consequence <\s>
<s> poetic excitement when accompanied by protracted labour in composition has throughout my life brought on more or less bodily derangement <\s>
<s> nevertheless i am at the close of my seventy third year in what may be called excellent health <\s>
<s> so that intellectual labour is not necessarily unfavourable to longevity <\s>
<s> but perhaps i ought here to add that mine has been generally carried on out of doors <\s>
<s> let me here say a few words of this poem by way of criticism <\s>
<s> the subject being taken from feudal times has led to its being compared to some of walter scott's poems that belong to the same age and state of society <\s>
<s> the comparison is inconsiderate <\s>
<s> sir walter pursued the customary and very natural course of conducting an action presenting various turns of fortune to some outstanding point on which the mind might rest as a termination or catastrophe <\s>
<s> the course i attempted to pursue is entirely different <\s>
<s> everything that is attempted by the principal personages in the white doe fails so far as its object is external and substantial so far as it is moral and spiritual it succeeds <\s>
<s> the heroine of the poem knows that her duty is not to interfere with the current of events either to forward or delay them but to abide the shock and finally secure o'er pain and grief a triumph pure <\s>
<s> this she does in obedience to her brother's injunction as most suitable to a mind and character that under previous trials had been proved to accord with his <\s>
<s> she achieves this not without aid from the communication with the inferior creature which often leads her thoughts to revolve upon the past with a tender and humanising influence that exalts rather than depresses her <\s>
<s> the anticipated beatification if i may so say of her mind and the apotheosis of the companion of her solitude are the points at which the poem aims and constitute its legitimate catastrophe far too spiritual a one for instant or widely spread sympathy but not therefore the less fitted to make a deep and permanent impression upon that class of minds who think and feel more independently than the many do of the surfaces of things and interests transitory because belonging more to the outward and social forms of life than to its internal spirit <\s>
<s> how insignificant a thing for example does personal prowess appear compared with the fortitude of patience and heroic martyrdom in other words with struggles for the sake of principle in preference to victory gloried in for its own sake <\s>
<s> to these remarks may be added the following in a letter from the writer to his friend archdeacon wrangham thanksgiving day jan <\s>
<s> my dear wrangham you have given me an additional mark of that friendly disposition and those affectionate feelings which i have long known you to possess by writing to me after my long and unjustifiable silence <\s>
<s> of the white doe i have little to say but that i hope it will be acceptable to the intelligent for whom alone it is written <\s>
<s> it starts from a high point of imagination and comes round through various wanderings of that faculty to a still higher nothing less than the apotheosis of the animal who gives the first of the two titles to the poem <\s>
<s> and as the poem thus begins and ends with pure and lofty imagination every motive and impetus that actuates the persons introduced is from the same source a kindred spirit pervades and is intended to harmonise the whole <\s>
<s> throughout objects the banner for instance derive their influence not from properties inherent in them not from what they are actually in themselves but from such as are bestowed upon them by the minds of those who are conversant with or affected by those objects <\s>
<s> thus the poetry if there be any in the work proceeds as it ought to do from the soul of man communicating its creative energies to the images of the external world <\s>

<s> the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> the poem of the white doe of rylstone is founded on a local tradition and on the ballad in percy's collection entitled the rising of the north <\s>
<s> the tradition is as follows about this time not long after the dissolution a white doe say the aged people of the neighbourhood long continued to make a weekly pilgrimage from rylstone over the falls of bolton and was constantly found in the abbey churchyard during divine service after the close of which she returned home as regularly as the rest of the congregation dr <\s>
<s> whitaker's history of the deanery of craven rylstone was the property and residence of the nortons distinguished in that ill advised and unfortunate insurrection which led me to connect with this tradition the principal circumstances of their fate as recorded in the ballad <\s>
<s> bolton priory says dr <\s>
<s> whitaker in his excellent book the history and antiquities of the deanery of craven stands upon a beautiful curvature of the wharf on a level sufficiently elevated to protect it from inundations and low enough for every purpose of picturesque effect <\s>
<s> opposite to the east window of the priory church the river washes the foot of a rock nearly perpendicular and of the richest purple where several of the mineral beds which break out instead of maintaining their usual inclination to the horizon are twisted by some inconceivable process into undulating and spiral lines <\s>
<s> to the south all is soft and delicious the eye reposes upon a few rich pastures a moderate reach of the river sufficiently tranquil to form a mirror to the sun and the bounding hills beyond neither too near nor too lofty to exclude even in winter any portion of his rays <\s>
<s> but after all the glories of bolton are on the north <\s>
<s> whatever the most fastidious taste could require to constitute a perfect landscape is not only found here but in its proper place <\s>
<s> in front and immediately under the eye is a smooth expanse of park like enclosure spotted with native elm ash c <\s>
<s> of the finest growth on the right a skirting oak wood with jutting points of grey rock on the left a rising copse <\s>
<s> still forward are seen the aged groves of bolton park the growth of centuries and farther yet the barren and rocky distances of simonseat and barden fell contrasted with the warmth fertility and luxuriant foliage of the valley below <\s>
<s> about half a mile above bolton the valley closes and either side of the wharf is overhung by solemn woods from which huge perpendicular masses of grey rock jut out at intervals <\s>
<s> this sequestered scene was almost inaccessible till of late that ridings have been cut on both sides of the river and the most interesting points laid open by judicious thinnings in the woods <\s>
<s> here a tributary stream rushes from a waterfall and bursts through a woody glen to mingle its waters with the wharf there the wharf itself is nearly lost in a deep cleft in the rock and next becomes a horned flood enclosing a woody island sometimes it reposes for a moment and then resumes its native character lively irregular and impetuous <\s>

<s> this chasm being incapable of receiving the winter floods has formed on either side a broad strand of naked gritstone full of rock basins or pots of the linn which bear witness to the restless impetuosity of so many northern torrents <\s>

<s> to the south all is soft and delicious the eye reposes upon a few rich pastures a moderate reach of the river sufficiently tranquil to form a mirror to the sun and the bounding hills beyond neither too near nor too lofty to exclude even in winter any portion of his rays <\s>

<s> hutchinson at the close of the year 1807 <\s>
<s> the country is flat and the weather was rough <\s>
<s> i was accustomed every day to walk to and fro under the shelter of a row of stacks in a field at a small distance from the town and there poured forth my verses aloud as freely as they would come <\s>

<s> it may be worth while to note as a caution to others who may cast their eyes on these memoranda that the skin having been rubbed off my heel by my wearing too tight a shoe though i desisted from walking i found that the irritation of the wounded part was kept up by the act of composition to a degree that made it necessary to give my constitution a holiday <\s>
<s> a rapid cure was the consequence <\s>
<s> poetic excitement when accompanied by protracted labour in composition has throughout my life brought on more or less bodily derangement <\s>
<s> nevertheless i am at the close of my seventy third year in what may be called excellent health <\s>
<s> so that intellectual labour is not necessarily unfavourable to longevity <\s>
<s> but perhaps i ought here to add that mine has been generally carried on out of doors <\s>
<s> let me here say a few words of this poem by way of criticism <\s>
<s> the subject being taken from feudal times has led to its being compared to some of walter scott's poems that belong to the same age and state of society <\s>
<s> the comparison is inconsiderate <\s>
<s> sir walter pursued the customary and very natural course of conducting an action presenting various turns of fortune to some outstanding point on which the mind might rest as a termination or catastrophe <\s>
<s> the course i attempted to pursue is entirely different <\s>
<s> everything that is attempted by the principal personages in the white doe fails so far as its object is external and substantial so far as it is moral and spiritual it succeeds <\s>
<s> the heroine of the poem knows that her duty is not to interfere with the current of events either to forward or delay them but to abide the shock and finally secure o'er pain and grief a triumph pure <\s>
<s> this she does in obedience to her brother's injunction as most suitable to a mind and character that under previous trials had been proved to accord with his <\s>
<s> she achieves this not without aid from the communication with the inferior creature which often leads her thoughts to revolve upon the past with a tender and humanising influence that exalts rather than depresses her <\s>
<s> the anticipated beatification if i may so say of her mind and the apotheosis of the companion of her solitude are the points at which the poem aims and constitute its legitimate catastrophe far too spiritual a one for instant or widely spread sympathy but not therefore the less fitted to make a deep and permanent impression upon that class of minds who think and feel more independently than the many do of the surfaces of things and interests transitory because belonging more to the outward and social forms of life than to its internal spirit <\s>
<s> how insignificant a thing for example does personal prowess appear compared with the fortitude of patience and heroic martyrdom in other words with struggles for the sake of principle in preference to victory gloried in for its own sake <\s>
<s> to these remarks may be added the following in a letter from the writer to his friend archdeacon wrangham thanksgiving day jan <\s>
<s> my dear wrangham you have given me an additional mark of that friendly disposition and those affectionate feelings which i have long known you to possess by writing to me after my long and unjustifiable silence <\s>
<s> of the white doe i have little to say but that i hope it will be acceptable to the intelligent for whom alone it is written <\s>
<s> it starts from a high point of imagination and comes round through various wanderings of that faculty to a still higher nothing less than the apotheosis of the animal who gives the first of the two titles to the poem <\s>
<s> and as the poem thus begins and ends with pure and lofty imagination every motive and impetus that actuates the persons introduced is from the same source a kindred spirit pervades and is intended to harmonise the whole <\s>
<s> throughout objects the banner for instance derive their influence not from properties inherent in them not from what they are actually in themselves but from such as are bestowed upon them by the minds of those who are conversant with or affected by those objects <\s>
<s> thus the poetry if there be any in the work proceeds as it ought to do from the soul of man communicating its creative energies to the images of the external world <\s>

<s> the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> the poem of the white doe of rylstone is founded on a local tradition and on the ballad in percy's collection entitled the rising of the north <\s>
<s> the tradition is as follows about this time not long after the dissolution a white doe say the aged people of the neighbourhood long continued to make a weekly pilgrimage from rylstone over the falls of bolton and was constantly found in the abbey churchyard during divine service after the close of which she returned home as regularly as the rest of the congregation dr <\s>
<s> whitaker's history of the deanery of craven rylstone was the property and residence of the nortons distinguished in that ill advised and unfortunate insurrection which led me to connect with this tradition the principal circumstances of their fate as recorded in the ballad <\s>
<s> bolton priory says dr <\s>
<s> whitaker in his excellent book the history and antiquities of the deanery of craven stands upon a beautiful curvature of the wharf on a level sufficiently elevated to protect it from inundations and low enough for every purpose of picturesque effect <\s>
<s> opposite to the east window of the priory church the river washes the foot of a rock nearly perpendicular and of the richest purple where several of the mineral beds which break out instead of maintaining their usual inclination to the horizon are twisted by some inconceivable process into undulating and spiral lines <\s>
<s> to the south all is soft and delicious the eye reposes upon a few rich pastures a moderate reach of the river sufficiently tranquil to form a mirror to the sun and the bounding hills beyond neither too near nor too lofty to exclude even in winter any portion of his rays <\s>
<s> but after all the glories of bolton are on the north <\s>
<s> whatever the most fastidious taste could require to constitute a perfect landscape is not only found here but in its proper place <\s>
<s> in front and immediately under the eye is a smooth expanse of park like enclosure spotted with native elm ash c <\s>
<s> of the finest growth on the right a skirting oak wood with jutting points of grey rock on the left a rising copse <\s>
<s> still forward are seen the aged groves of bolton park the growth of centuries and farther yet the barren and rocky distances of simonseat and barden fell contrasted with the warmth fertility and luxuriant foliage of the valley below <\s>
<s> about half a mile above bolton the valley closes and either side of the wharf is overhung by solemn woods from which huge perpendicular masses of grey rock jut out at intervals <\s>
<s> this sequestered scene was almost inaccessible till of late that ridings have been cut on both sides of the river and the most interesting points laid open by judicious thinnings in the woods <\s>
<s> here a tributary stream rushes from a waterfall and bursts through a woody glen to mingle its waters with the wharf there the wharf itself is nearly lost in a deep cleft in the rock and next becomes a horned flood enclosing a woody island sometimes it reposes for a moment and then resumes its native character lively irregular and impetuous <\s>

<s> this chasm being incapable of receiving the winter floods has formed on either side a broad strand of naked gritstone full of rock basins or pots of the linn which bear witness to the restless impetuosity of so many northern torrents <\s>

<s> to the south all is soft and delicious the eye reposes upon a few rich pastures a moderate reach of the river sufficiently tranquil to form a mirror to the sun and the bounding hills beyond neither too near nor too lofty to exclude even in winter any portion of his rays <\s>

<s> hutchinson at the close of the year 1807 <\s>
<s> the country is flat and the weather was rough <\s>
<s> i was accustomed every day to walk to and fro under the shelter of a row of stacks in a field at a small distance from the town and there poured forth my verses aloud as freely as they would come <\s>

<s> it may be worth while to note as a caution to others who may cast their eyes on these memoranda that the skin having been rubbed off my heel by my wearing too tight a shoe though i desisted from walking i found that the irritation of the wounded part was kept up by the act of composition to a degree that made it necessary to give my constitution a holiday <\s>
<s> a rapid cure was the consequence <\s>
<s> poetic excitement when accompanied by protracted labour in composition has throughout my life brought on more or less bodily derangement <\s>
<s> nevertheless i am at the close of my seventy third year in what may be called excellent health <\s>
<s> so that intellectual labour is not necessarily unfavourable to longevity <\s>
<s> but perhaps i ought here to add that mine has been generally carried on out of doors <\s>
<s> let me here say a few words of this poem by way of criticism <\s>
<s> the subject being taken from feudal times has led to its being compared to some of walter scott's poems that belong to the same age and state of society <\s>
<s> the comparison is inconsiderate <\s>
<s> sir walter pursued the customary and very natural course of conducting an action presenting various turns of fortune to some outstanding point on which the mind might rest as a termination or catastrophe <\s>
<s> the course i attempted to pursue is entirely different <\s>
<s> everything that is attempted by the principal personages in the white doe fails so far as its object is external and substantial so far as it is moral and spiritual it succeeds <\s>
<s> the heroine of the poem knows that her duty is not to interfere with the current of events either to forward or delay them but to abide the shock and finally secure o'er pain and grief a triumph pure <\s>
<s> this she does in obedience to her brother's injunction as most suitable to a mind and character that under previous trials had been proved to accord with his <\s>
<s> she achieves this not without aid from the communication with the inferior creature which often leads her thoughts to revolve upon the past with a tender and humanising influence that exalts rather than depresses her <\s>
<s> the anticipated beatification if i may so say of her mind and the apotheosis of the companion of her solitude are the points at which the poem aims and constitute its legitimate catastrophe far too spiritual a one for instant or widely spread sympathy but not therefore the less fitted to make a deep and permanent impression upon that class of minds who think and feel more independently than the many do of the surfaces of things and interests transitory because belonging more to the outward and social forms of life than to its internal spirit <\s>
<s> how insignificant a thing for example does personal prowess appear compared with the fortitude of patience and heroic martyrdom in other words with struggles for the sake of principle in preference to victory gloried in for its own sake <\s>
<s> to these remarks may be added the following in a letter from the writer to his friend archdeacon wrangham thanksgiving day jan <\s>
<s> my dear wrangham you have given me an additional mark of that friendly disposition and those affectionate feelings which i have long known you to possess by writing to me after my long and unjustifiable silence <\s>
<s> of the white doe i have little to say but that i hope it will be acceptable to the intelligent for whom alone it is written <\s>
<s> it starts from a high point of imagination and comes round through various wanderings of that faculty to a still higher nothing less than the apotheosis of the animal who gives the first of the two titles to the poem <\s>
<s> and as the poem thus begins and ends with pure and lofty imagination every motive and impetus that actuates the persons introduced is from the same source a kindred spirit pervades and is intended to harmonise the whole <\s>
<s> throughout objects the banner for instance derive their influence not from properties inherent in them not from what they are actually in themselves but from such as are bestowed upon them by the minds of those who are conversant with or affected by those objects <\s>
<s> thus the poetry if there be any in the work proceeds as it ought to do from the soul of man communicating its creative energies to the images of the external world <\s>

<s> the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> the poem of the white doe of rylstone is founded on a local tradition and on the ballad in percy's collection entitled the rising of the north <\s>
<s> the tradition is as follows about this time not long after the dissolution a white doe say the aged people of the neighbourhood long continued to make a weekly pilgrimage from rylstone over the falls of bolton and was constantly found in the abbey churchyard during divine service after the close of which she returned home as regularly as the rest of the congregation dr <\s>
<s> whitaker's history of the deanery of craven rylstone was the property and residence of the nortons distinguished in that ill advised and unfortunate insurrection which led me to connect with this tradition the principal circumstances of their fate as recorded in the ballad <\s>
<s> bolton priory says dr <\s>
<s> whitaker in his excellent book the history and antiquities of the deanery of craven stands upon a beautiful curvature of the wharf on a level sufficiently elevated to protect it from inundations and low enough for every purpose of picturesque effect <\s>
<s> opposite to the east window of the priory church the river washes the foot of a rock nearly perpendicular and of the richest purple where several of the mineral beds which break out instead of maintaining their usual inclination to the horizon are twisted by some inconceivable process into undulating and spiral lines <\s>
<s> to the south all is soft and delicious the eye reposes upon a few rich pastures a moderate reach of the river sufficiently tranquil to form a mirror to the sun and the bounding hills beyond neither too near nor too lofty to exclude even in winter any portion of his rays <\s>
<s> but after all the glories of bolton are on the north <\s>
<s> whatever the most fastidious taste could require to constitute a perfect landscape is not only found here but in its proper place <\s>
<s> in front and immediately under the eye is a smooth expanse of park like enclosure spotted with native elm ash c <\s>
<s> of the finest growth on the right a skirting oak wood with jutting points of grey rock on the left a rising copse <\s>
<s> still forward are seen the aged groves of bolton park the growth of centuries and farther yet the barren and rocky distances of simonseat and barden fell contrasted with the warmth fertility and luxuriant foliage of the valley below <\s>
<s> about half a mile above bolton the valley closes and either side of the wharf is overhung by solemn woods from which huge perpendicular masses of grey rock jut out at intervals <\s>
<s> this sequestered scene was almost inaccessible till of late that ridings have been cut on both sides of the river and the most interesting points laid open by judicious thinnings in the woods <\s>
<s> here a tributary stream rushes from a waterfall and bursts through a woody glen to mingle its waters with the wharf there the wharf itself is nearly lost in a deep cleft in the rock and next becomes a horned flood enclosing a woody island sometimes it reposes for a moment and then resumes its native character lively irregular and impetuous <\s>

<s> this chasm being incapable of receiving the winter floods has formed on either side a broad strand of naked gritstone full of rock basins or pots of the linn which bear witness to the restless impetuosity of so many northern torrents <\s>

<s> to the south all is soft and delicious the eye reposes upon a few rich pastures a moderate reach of the river sufficiently tranquil to form a mirror to the sun and the bounding hills beyond neither too near nor too lofty to exclude even in winter any portion of his rays <\s>

<s> hutchinson at the close of the year 1807 <\s>
<s> the country is flat and the weather was rough <\s>
<s> i was accustomed every day to walk to and fro under the shelter of a row of stacks in a field at a small distance from the town and there poured forth my verses aloud as freely as they would come <\s>

<s> it may be worth while to note as a caution to others who may cast their eyes on these memoranda that the skin having been rubbed off my heel by my wearing too tight a shoe though i desisted from walking i found that the irritation of the wounded part was kept up by the act of composition to a degree that made it necessary to give my constitution a holiday <\s>
<s> a rapid cure was the consequence <\s>
<s> poetic excitement when accompanied by protracted labour in composition has throughout my life brought on more or less bodily derangement <\s>
<s> nevertheless i am at the close of my seventy third year in what may be called excellent health <\s>
<s> so that intellectual labour is not necessarily unfavourable to longevity <\s>
<s> but perhaps i ought here to add that mine has been generally carried on out of doors <\s>
<s> let me here say a few words of this poem by way of criticism <\s>
<s> the subject being taken from feudal times has led to its being compared to some of walter scott's poems that belong to the same age and state of society <\s>
<s> the comparison is inconsiderate <\s>
<s> sir walter pursued the customary and very natural course of conducting an action presenting various turns of fortune to some outstanding point on which the mind might rest as a termination or catastrophe <\s>
<s> the course i attempted to pursue is entirely different <\s>
<s> everything that is attempted by the principal personages in the white doe fails so far as its object is external and substantial so far as it is moral and spiritual it succeeds <\s>
<s> the heroine of the poem knows that her duty is not to interfere with the current of events either to forward or delay them but to abide the shock and finally secure o'er pain and grief a triumph pure <\s>
<s> this she does in obedience to her brother's injunction as most suitable to a mind and character that under previous trials had been proved to accord with his <\s>
<s> she achieves this not without aid from the communication with the inferior creature which often leads her thoughts to revolve upon the past with a tender and humanising influence that exalts rather than depresses her <\s>
<s> the anticipated beatification if i may so say of her mind and the apotheosis of the companion of her solitude are the points at which the poem aims and constitute its legitimate catastrophe far too spiritual a one for instant or widely spread sympathy but not therefore the less fitted to make a deep and permanent impression upon that class of minds who think and feel more independently than the many do of the surfaces of things and interests transitory because belonging more to the outward and social forms of life than to its internal spirit <\s>
<s> how insignificant a thing for example does personal prowess appear compared with the fortitude of patience and heroic martyrdom in other words with struggles for the sake of principle in preference to victory gloried in for its own sake <\s>
<s> to these remarks may be added the following in a letter from the writer to his friend archdeacon wrangham thanksgiving day jan <\s>
<s> my dear wrangham you have given me an additional mark of that friendly disposition and those affectionate feelings which i have long known you to possess by writing to me after my long and unjustifiable silence <\s>
<s> of the white doe i have little to say but that i hope it will be acceptable to the intelligent for whom alone it is written <\s>
<s> it starts from a high point of imagination and comes round through various wanderings of that faculty to a still higher nothing less than the apotheosis of the animal who gives the first of the two titles to the poem <\s>
<s> and as the poem thus begins and ends with pure and lofty imagination every motive and impetus that actuates the persons introduced is from the same source a kindred spirit pervades and is intended to harmonise the whole <\s>
<s> throughout objects the banner for instance derive their influence not from properties inherent in them not from what they are actually in themselves but from such as are bestowed upon them by the minds of those who are conversant with or affected by those objects <\s>
<s> thus the poetry if there be any in the work proceeds as it ought to do from the soul of man communicating its creative energies to the images of the external world <\s>

<s> the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> the poem of the white doe of rylstone is founded on a local tradition and on the ballad in percy's collection entitled the rising of the north <\s>
<s> the tradition is as follows about this time not long after the dissolution a white doe say the aged people of the neighbourhood long continued to make a weekly pilgrimage from rylstone over the falls of bolton and was constantly found in the abbey churchyard during divine service after the close of which she returned home as regularly as the rest of the congregation dr <\s>
<s> whitaker's history of the deanery of craven rylstone was the property and residence of the nortons distinguished in that ill advised and unfortunate insurrection which led me to connect with this tradition the principal circumstances of their fate as recorded in the ballad <\s>
<s> bolton priory says dr <\s>
<s> whitaker in his excellent book the history and antiquities of the deanery of craven stands upon a beautiful curvature of the wharf on a level sufficiently elevated to protect it from inundations and low enough for every purpose of picturesque effect <\s>
<s> opposite to the east window of the priory church the river washes the foot of a rock nearly perpendicular and of the richest purple where several of the mineral beds which break out instead of maintaining their usual inclination to the horizon are twisted by some inconceivable process into undulating and spiral lines <\s>
<s> to the south all is soft and delicious the eye reposes upon a few rich pastures a moderate reach of the river sufficiently tranquil to form a mirror to the sun and the bounding hills beyond neither too near nor too lofty to exclude even in winter any portion of his rays <\s>
<s> but after all the glories of bolton are on the north <\s>
<s> whatever the most fastidious taste could require to constitute a perfect landscape is not only found here but in its proper place <\s>
<s> in front and immediately under the eye is a smooth expanse of park like enclosure spotted with native elm ash c <\s>
<s> of the finest growth on the right a skirting oak wood with jutting points of grey rock on the left a rising copse <\s>
<s> still forward are seen the aged groves of bolton park the growth of centuries and farther yet the barren and rocky distances of simonseat and barden fell contrasted with the warmth fertility and luxuriant foliage of the valley below <\s>
<s> about half a mile above bolton the valley closes and either side of the wharf is overhung by solemn woods from which huge perpendicular masses of grey rock jut out at intervals <\s>
<s> this sequestered scene was almost inaccessible till of late that ridings have been cut on both sides of the river and the most interesting points laid open by judicious thinnings in the woods <\s>
<s> here a tributary stream rushes from a waterfall and bursts through a woody glen to mingle its waters with the wharf there the wharf itself is nearly lost in a deep cleft in the rock and next becomes a horned flood enclosing a woody island sometimes it reposes for a moment and then resumes its native character lively irregular and impetuous <\s>

<s> this chasm being incapable of receiving the winter floods has formed on either side a broad strand of naked gritstone full of rock basins or pots of the linn which bear witness to the restless impetuosity of so many northern torrents <\s>

<s> to the south all is soft and delicious the eye reposes upon a few rich pastures a moderate reach of the river sufficiently tranquil to form a mirror to the sun and the bounding hills beyond neither too near nor too lofty to exclude even in winter any portion of his rays <\s>

<s> hutchinson at the close of the year 1807 <\s>
<s> the country is flat and the weather was rough <\s>
<s> i was accustomed every day to walk to and fro under the shelter of a row of stacks in a field at a small distance from the town and there poured forth my verses aloud as freely as they would come <\s>

<s> it may be worth while to note as a caution to others who may cast their eyes on these memoranda that the skin having been rubbed off my heel by my wearing too tight a shoe though i desisted from walking i found that the irritation of the wounded part was kept up by the act of composition to a degree that made it necessary to give my constitution a holiday <\s>
<s> a rapid cure was the consequence <\s>
<s> poetic excitement when accompanied by protracted labour in composition has throughout my life brought on more or less bodily derangement <\s>
<s> nevertheless i am at the close of my seventy third year in what may be called excellent health <\s>
<s> so that intellectual labour is not necessarily unfavourable to longevity <\s>
<s> but perhaps i ought here to add that mine has been generally carried on out of doors <\s>
<s> let me here say a few words of this poem by way of criticism <\s>
<s> the subject being taken from feudal times has led to its being compared to some of walter scott's poems that belong to the same age and state of society <\s>
<s> the comparison is inconsiderate <\s>
<s> sir walter pursued the customary and very natural course of conducting an action presenting various turns of fortune to some outstanding point on which the mind might rest as a termination or catastrophe <\s>
<s> the course i attempted to pursue is entirely different <\s>
<s> everything that is attempted by the principal personages in the white doe fails so far as its object is external and substantial so far as it is moral and spiritual it succeeds <\s>
<s> the heroine of the poem knows that her duty is not to interfere with the current of events either to forward or delay them but to abide the shock and finally secure o'er pain and grief a triumph pure <\s>
<s> this she does in obedience to her brother's injunction as most suitable to a mind and character that under previous trials had been proved to accord with his <\s>
<s> she achieves this not without aid from the communication with the inferior creature which often leads her thoughts to revolve upon the past with a tender and humanising influence that exalts rather than depresses her <\s>
<s> the anticipated beatification if i may so say of her mind and the apotheosis of the companion of her solitude are the points at which the poem aims and constitute its legitimate catastrophe far too spiritual a one for instant or widely spread sympathy but not therefore the less fitted to make a deep and permanent impression upon that class of minds who think and feel more independently than the many do of the surfaces of things and interests transitory because belonging more to the outward and social forms of life than to its internal spirit <\s>
<s> how insignificant a thing for example does personal prowess appear compared with the fortitude of patience and heroic martyrdom in other words with struggles for the sake of principle in preference to victory gloried in for its own sake <\s>
<s> to these remarks may be added the following in a letter from the writer to his friend archdeacon wrangham thanksgiving day jan <\s>
<s> my dear wrangham you have given me an additional mark of that friendly disposition and those affectionate feelings which i have long known you to possess by writing to me after my long and unjustifiable silence <\s>
<s> of the white doe i have little to say but that i hope it will be acceptable to the intelligent for whom alone it is written <\s>
<s> it starts from a high point of imagination and comes round through various wanderings of that faculty to a still higher nothing less than the apotheosis of the animal who gives the first of the two titles to the poem <\s>
<s> and as the poem thus begins and ends with pure and lofty imagination every motive and impetus that actuates the persons introduced is from the same source a kindred spirit pervades and is intended to harmonise the whole <\s>
<s> throughout objects the banner for instance derive their influence not from properties inherent in them not from what they are actually in themselves but from such as are bestowed upon them by the minds of those who are conversant with or affected by those objects <\s>
<s> thus the poetry if there be any in the work proceeds as it ought to do from the soul of man communicating its creative energies to the images of the external world <\s>

<s> the white doe of rylstone <\s>
<s> the poem of the white doe of rylstone is founded on a local tradition and on the ballad in percy's collection entitled the rising of the north <\s>
<s> the tradition is as follows about this time not long after the dissolution a white doe say the aged people of the neighbourhood long continued to make a weekly pilgrimage from rylstone over the falls of bolton and was constantly found in the abbey churchyard during divine service after the close of which she returned home as regularly as the rest of the congregation dr <\s>
<s> whitaker's history of the deanery of craven rylstone was the property and residence of the nortons distinguished in that ill advised and unfortunate insurrection which led me to connect with this tradition the principal circumstances of their fate as recorded in the ballad <\s>
<s> bolton priory says dr <\s>
<s> whitaker in his excellent book the history and antiquities of the deanery of craven stands upon a beautiful curvature of the wharf on a level sufficiently elevated to protect it from inundations and low enough for every purpose of picturesque effect <\s>
<s> opposite to the east window of the priory church the river washes the foot of a rock nearly perpendicular and of the richest purple where several of the mineral beds which break out instead of maintaining their usual inclination to the horizon are twisted by some inconceivable process into undulating and spiral lines <\s>
<s> to the south all is soft and delicious the eye reposes upon a few rich pastures a moderate reach of the river sufficiently tranquil to form a mirror to the sun and the bounding hills beyond neither too near nor too lofty to exclude even in winter any portion of his rays <\s>
<s> but after all the glories of bolton are on the north <\s>
<s> whatever the most fastidious taste could require to constitute a perfect landscape is not only found here but in its proper place <\s>
<s> in front and immediately under the eye is a smooth expanse of park like enclosure spotted with native elm ash c <\s>
<s> of the finest growth on the right a skirting oak wood with jutting points of grey rock on the left a rising copse <\s>
<s> still forward are seen the aged groves of bolton park the growth of centuries and farther yet the barren and rocky distances of simonseat and barden fell contrasted with the warmth fertility and luxuriant foliage of the valley below <\s>
<s> about half a mile above bolton the valley closes and either side of the wharf is overhung by solemn woods from which huge perpendicular masses of grey rock jut out at intervals <\s>
<s> this sequestered scene was almost inaccessible till of late that ridings have been cut on both sides of the river and the most interesting points laid open by judicious thinnings in the woods <\s>
<s> here a tributary stream rushes from a waterfall and bursts through a woody glen to mingle its waters with the wharf there the wharf itself is nearly lost in a deep cleft in the rock and next becomes a horned flood enclosing a woody island sometimes it reposes for a moment and then resumes its native character lively irregular and impetuous <\s>

<s> this chasm being incapable of receiving the winter floods has formed on either side a broad strand of naked gritstone full of rock basins or pots of the linn which bear witness to the restless impetuosity of so many northern torrents <\s>

<s> affecting proofs occur in every one's experience who is acquainted with the unfortunate and the indigent of their unwillingness to derive their subsistence from aught but their own funds or labour or to be indebted to parochial assistance for the attainment of any object however dear to them <\s>
<s> a case was reported the other day from a coroner's inquest of a pair who through the space of four years had carried about their dead infant from house to house and from lodging to lodging as their necessities drove them rather than ask the parish to bear the expense of its interment the poor creatures lived in the hope of one day being able to bury their child at their own cost <\s>
<s> it must have been heart rending to see and hear the mother who had been called upon to account for the state in which the body was found make this deposition <\s>
<s> by some judging coldly if not harshly this conduct might be imputed to an unwarrantable pride as she and her husband had it is true been once in prosperity <\s>
<s> but examples where the spirit of independence works with equal strength though not with like miserable accompaniments are frequently to be found even yet among the humblest peasantry and mechanics <\s>
<s> there is not then sufficient cause for doubting that a like sense of honour may be revived among the people and their ancient habits of independence restored without resorting to those severities which the new poor law act has introduced <\s>
<s> but even if the surfaces of things only are to be examined we have a right to expect that lawgivers should take into account the various tempers and dispositions of mankind while some are led by the existence of a legislative provision into idleness and extravagance the economical virtues might be cherished in others by the knowledge that if all their efforts fail they have in the poor laws a refuge from the storm and a shadow from the heat <\s>
<s> despondency and distraction are no friends to prudence the springs of industry will relax if cheerfulness be destroyed by anxiety without hope men become reckless and have a sullen pride in adding to the heap of their own wretchedness <\s>
<s> he who feels that he is abandoned by his fellow men will be almost irresistibly driven to care little for himself will lose his self respect accordingly and with that loss what remains to him of virtue <\s>
<s> with all due deference to the particular experience and general intelligence of the individuals who framed the act and of those who in and out of parliament have approved of and supported it it may be said that it proceeds too much upon the presumption that it is a labouring man's own fault if he be not as the phrase is before hand with the world <\s>
<s> but the most prudent are liable to be thrown back by sickness cutting them off from labour and causing to them expense and who but has observed how distress creeps upon multitudes without misconduct of their own and merely from a gradual fall in the price of labour without a correspondent one in the price of provisions so that men who may have ventured upon the marriage state with a fair prospect of maintaining their families in comfort and happiness see them reduced to a pittance which no effort of theirs can increase <\s>
<s> let it be remembered also that there are thousands with whom vicious habits of expense are not the cause why they do not store up their gains but they are generous and kind hearted and ready to help their kindred and friends moreover they have a faith in providence that those who have been prompt to assist others will not be left destitute should they themselves come to need <\s>
<s> by acting from these blended feelings numbers have rendered themselves incapable of standing up against a sudden reverse <\s>
<s> nevertheless these men in common with all who have the misfortune to be in want if many theorists had their wish would be thrown upon one or other of those three sharp points of condition before adverted to from which the intervention of law has hitherto saved them <\s>
<s> all that has been said tends to show how the principle contended for makes the gift of life more valuable and has it may be hoped led to the conclusion that its legitimate operation is to make men worthier of that gift in other words not to degrade but to exalt human nature <\s>
<s> but the subject must not be dismissed without adverting to the indirect influence of the same principle upon the moral sentiments of a people among whom it is embodied in law <\s>
<s> in our criminal jurisprudence there is a maxim deservedly eulogised that it is better that ten guilty persons should escape than that one innocent man should suffer so also might it be maintained with regard to the poor laws that it is better for the interests of humanity among the people at large that ten undeserving should partake of the funds provided than that one morally good man through want of relief should either have his principles corrupted or his energies destroyed than that such a one should either be driven to do wrong or be cast to the earth in utter hopelessness <\s>
<s> in france the english maxim of criminal jurisprudence is reversed there it is deemed better that ten innocent men should suffer than one guilty escape in france there is no universal provision for the poor and we may judge of the small value set upon human life in the metropolis of that country by merely noticing the disrespect with which after death the body is treated not by the thoughtless vulgar but in schools of anatomy presided over by men allowed to be in their own art and in physical science among the most enlightened in the world <\s>
<s> in the east where countries are overrun with population as with a weed infinitely more respect is shown to the remains of the deceased and what a bitter mockery is it that this insensibility should be found where civil polity is so busy in minor regulations and ostentatiously careful to gratify the luxurious propensities whether social or intellectual of the multitude <\s>
<s> irreligion is no doubt much concerned with this offensive disrespect shown to the bodies of the dead in france but it is mainly attributable to the state in which so many of the living are left by the absence of compulsory provision for the indigent so humanely established by the law of england <\s>
<s> sights of abject misery perpetually recurring harden the heart of the community <\s>
<s> in the perusal of history and of works of fiction we are not indeed unwilling to have our commiseration excited by such objects of distress as they present to us but in the concerns of real life men know that such emotions are not given to be indulged for their own sakes there the conscience declares to them that sympathy must be followed by action and if there exist a previous conviction that the power to relieve is utterly inadequate to the demand the eye shrinks from communication with wretchedness and pity and compassion languish like any other qualities that are deprived of their natural aliment <\s>
<s> let these considerations be duly weighed by those who trust to the hope that an increase of private charity with all its advantages of superior discrimination would more than compensate for the abandonment of those principles the wisdom of which has been here insisted upon <\s>
<s> how discouraging also would be the sense of injustice which could not fail to arise in the minds of the well disposed if the burden of supporting the poor a burden of which the selfish have hitherto by compulsion borne a share should now or hereafter be thrown exclusively upon the benevolent <\s>
<s> by having put an end to the slave trade and slavery the british people are exalted in the scale of humanity and they cannot but feel so if they look into themselves and duly consider their relation to god and their fellow creatures <\s>
<s> that was a noble advance but a retrograde movement will assuredly be made if ever the principle which has been here defended should be either avowedly abandoned or but ostensibly retained <\s>
<s> but after all there may be a little reason to apprehend permanent injury from any experiment that may be tried <\s>
<s> on the one side will be human nature rising up in her own defence and on the other prudential selfishness acting to the same purpose from a conviction that without a compulsory provision for the exigencies of the labouring multitude that degree of ability to regulate the price of labour which is indispensable for the reasonable interest of arts and manufactures cannot in great britain be upheld <\s>
<s> in a poem of the foregoing collection allusion is made to the state of the workmen congregated in manufactories <\s>
<s> in order to relieve many of the evils to which that class of society are subject and to establish a better harmony between them and their employers it would be well to repeal such laws as prevent the formation of joint stock companies <\s>
<s> there are no doubt many and great obstacles to the formation and salutary working of these societies inherent in the mind of those whom they would obviously benefit <\s>
<s> but the combinations of masters to keep down unjustly the price of labour would be fairly checked by them as far as they were practicable they would encourage economy inasmuch as they would enable a man to draw profit from his savings by investing them in buildings or machinery for processes of manufacture with which he was habitually connected <\s>
<s> his little capital would then be working for him while he was at rest or asleep he would more clearly perceive the necessity of capital for carrying on great works he would better learn to respect the larger portions of it in the hands of others he would be less tempted to join in unjust combinations and for the sake of his own property if not for higher reasons he would be slow to promote local disturbance or endanger public tranquillity he would at least be loth to act in that way knowingly for it is not to be denied that such societies might be nurseries of opinions unfavourable to a mixed constitution of government like that of great britain <\s>
<s> the democratic and republican spirit which they might be apt to foster would not however be dangerous in itself but only as it might act without being sufficiently counterbalanced either by landed proprietorship or by a church extending itself so as to embrace an ever growing and ever shifting population of mechanics and artisans <\s>
<s> but if the tendencies of such societies would be to make the men prosper who might belong to them rulers and legislators should rejoice in the result and do their duty to the state by upholding and extending the influence of that church to which it owes in so great a measure its safety its prosperity and its glory <\s>
<s> this in the temper of the present times may be difficult but it is become indispensable since large towns in great numbers have sprung up and others have increased tenfold with little or no dependence upon the gentry and the landed proprietors and apart from those mitigated feudal institutions which till of late have acted so powerfully upon the composition of the house of commons <\s>
<s> now it may be affirmed that in quarters where there is not an attachment to the church or the landed aristocracy and a pride in supporting them there the people will dislike both and be ready upon such incitements as are perpetually recurring to join in attempts to overthrow them <\s>
<s> there is no neutral ground here from want of due attention to the state of society in large towns and manufacturing districts and ignorance or disregard of these obvious truths innumerable well meaning persons became zealous supporters of a reform bill the qualities and powers of which whether destructive or constructive they would otherwise have been afraid of and even the framers of that bill swayed as they might be by party resentments and personal ambition could not have gone so far had not they too been lamentably ignorant or neglectful of the same truths both of fact and philosophy <\s>
<s> but let that pass and let no opponent of the bill be tempted to compliment his own foresight by exaggerating the mischiefs and dangers that have sprung from it let not time be wasted in profitless regrets and let those party distinctions vanish to their very names that have separated men who whatever course they may have pursued have ever had a bond of union in the wish to save the limited monarchy and those other institutions that have under providence rendered for so long a period of time this country the happiest and worthiest of which there is any record since the foundation of civil society <\s>
<s> a philosophic mind is best pleased when looking at religion in its spiritual bearing as a guide of conduct a solace under affliction and a support amid the instabilities of mortal life but the church having been forcibly brought by political considerations to my notice while treating of the labouring classes i cannot forbear saying a few words upon that momentous topic <\s>
<s> there is a loud clamour for extensive change in that department <\s>
<s> the clamour would be entitled to more respect if they who are the most eager to swell it with their voices were not generally the most ignorant of the real state of the church and the service it renders to the community <\s>
<s> reform is the word employed <\s>
<s> let us pause and consider what sense it is apt to carry and how things are confounded by a lax use of it <\s>
<s> the great religious reformation in the sixteenth century did not profess to be a new construction but a restoration of something fallen into decay or put out of sight <\s>
<s> that familiar and justifiable use of the word seems to have paved the way for fallacies with respect to the term reform which it is difficult to escape from <\s>
<s> were we to speak of improvement and the correction of abuses we should run less risk of being deceived ourselves or of misleading others <\s>
<s> we should be less likely to fall blindly into the belief that the change demanded is a renewal of something that has existed before and that therefore we have experience on our side nor should we be equally tempted to beg the question that the change for which we are eager must be advantageous <\s>
<s> from generation to generation men are the dupes of words and it is painful to observe that so many of our species are most tenacious of those opinions which they have formed with the least consideration <\s>

<s> let us pause and consider what sense it is apt to carry and how things are confounded by a lax use of it <\s>

<s> that familiar and justifiable use of the word seems to have paved the way for fallacies with respect to the term reform which it is difficult to escape from <\s>
<s> were we to speak of improvement and the correction of abuses we should run less risk of being deceived ourselves or of misleading others <\s>
<s> we should be less likely to fall blindly into the belief that the change demanded is a renewal of something that has existed before and that therefore we have experience on our side nor should we be equally tempted to beg the question that the change for which we are eager must be advantageous <\s>
<s> from generation to generation men are the dupes of words and it is painful to observe that so many of our species are most tenacious of those opinions which they have formed with the least consideration <\s>
<s> of legislation for the poor the working classes and the clergy <\s>
<s> in the present volume as in those that have preceded it the reader will have found occasionally opinions expressed upon the course of public affairs and feelings given vent to as national interests excited them <\s>
<s> since nothing i trust has been uttered but in the spirit of reflective patriotism those notices are left to produce their own effect but among the many objects of general concern and the changes going forward which i have glanced at in verse are some especially affecting the lower orders of society in reference to these i wish here to add a few words in plain prose <\s>
<s> were i conscious of being able to do justice to those important topics i might avail myself of the periodical press for offering anonymously my thoughts such as they are to the world but i feel that in procuring attention they may derive some advantage however small from my name in addition to that of being presented in a less fugitive shape <\s>
<s> it is also not impossible that the state of mind which some of the foregoing poems may have produced in the reader will dispose him to receive more readily the impression which i desire to make and to admit the conclusions i would establish <\s>
<s> the first thing that presses upon my attention is the poor law amendment act <\s>
<s> i am aware of the magnitude and complexity of the subject and the unwearied attention which it has received from men of far wider experience than my own yet i cannot forbear touching upon one point of it and to this i will confine myself though not insensible to the objection which may reasonably be brought against treating a portion of this or any other great scheme of civil polity separately from the whole <\s>
<s> the point to which i wish to draw the reader's attention is that all persons who cannot find employment or procure wages sufficient to support the body in health and strength are entitled to a maintenance by law <\s>
<s> this dictate of humanity is acknowledged in the report of the commissioners but is there not room for apprehension that some of the regulations of the new act have a tendency to render the principle nugatory by difficulties thrown in the way of applying it <\s>
<s> if this be so persons will not be wanting to show it by examining the provisions of the act in detail an attempt which would be quite out of place here but it will not therefore be deemed unbecoming in one who fears that the prudence of the head may in framing some of those provisions have supplanted the wisdom of the heart to enforce a principle which cannot be violated without infringing upon one of the most precious rights of the english people and opposing one of the most sacred claims of civilised humanity <\s>
<s> there can be no greater error in this department of legislation than the belief that this principle does by necessity operate for the degradation of those who claim or are so circumstanced as to make it likely they may claim through laws founded upon it relief or assistance <\s>
<s> the direct contrary is the truth it may be unanswerably maintained that its tendency is to raise not to depress by stamping a value upon life which can belong to it only where the laws have placed men who are willing to work and yet cannot find employment above the necessity of looking for protection against hunger and other natural evils either to individual and casual charity to despair and death or to the breach of law by theft or violence <\s>
<s> and here as in the report of the commissioners the fundamental principle has been recognised i am not at issue with them any farther than i am compelled to believe that their remedial measures obstruct the application of it more than the interests of society require <\s>
<s> and calling to mind the doctrines of political economy which are now prevalent i cannot forbear to enforce the justice of the principle and to insist upon its salutary operation <\s>
<s> and first for its justice if self preservation be the first law of our nature would not every one in a state of nature be morally justified in taking to himself that which is indispensable to such preservation where by so doing he would not rob another of that which might be equally indispensable to his preservation <\s>
<s> and if the value of life be regarded in a right point of view may it not be questioned whether this right of preserving life at any expense short of endangering the life of another does not survive man's entering into the social state whether this right can be surrendered or forfeited except when it opposes the divine law upon any supposition of a social compact or of any convention for the protection of mere rights of property <\s>
<s> but if it be not safe to touch the abstract question of man's right in a social state to help himself even in the last extremity may we not still contend for the duty of a christian government standing in loco parentis towards all its subjects to make such effectual provision that no one shall be in danger of perishing either through the neglect or harshness of its legislation <\s>
<s> or waiving this is it not indisputable that the claim of the state to the allegiance involves the protection of the subject <\s>
<s> and as all rights in one party impose a correlative duty upon another it follows that the right of the state to require the services of its members even to the jeoparding of their lives in the common defence establishes a right in the people not to be gainsaid by utilitarians and economists to public support when from any cause they may be unable to support themselves <\s>
<s> let us now consider the salutary and benign operation of this principle <\s>
<s> here we must have recourse to elementary feelings of human nature and to truths which from their very obviousness are apt to be slighted till they are forced upon our notice by our own sufferings or those of others <\s>
<s> in the paradise lost milton represents adam after the fall as exclaiming in the anguish of his soul did i request thee maker from my clay to mould me man did i solicit thee from darkness to promote me <\s>
<s> my will concurred not to my being <\s>
<s> under how many various pressures of misery have men been driven thus in a strain touching upon impiety to expostulate with the creator <\s>
<s> and under few so afflictive as when the source and origin of earthly existence have been brought back to the mind by its impending close in the pangs of destitution <\s>
<s> but as long as in our legislation due weight shall be given to this principle no man will be forced to bewail the gift of life in hopeless want of the necessaries of life <\s>
<s> englishmen have therefore by the progress of civilisation among them been placed in circumstances more favourable to piety and resignation to the divine will than the inhabitants of other countries where a like provision has not been established <\s>
<s> and as providence in this care of our countrymen acts through a human medium the objects of that care must in like manner be more inclined towards a grateful love of their fellow men <\s>
<s> thus also do stronger ties attach the people to their country whether while they tread its soil or at a distance think of their native land as an indulgent parent to whose arms even they who have been imprudent and undeserving may like the prodigal son betake themselves without fear of being rejected <\s>
<s> such is the view of the case that would first present itself to a reflective mind and it is in vain to show by appeals to experience in contrast with this view that provisions founded upon the principle have promoted profaneness of life and dispositions the reverse of philanthropic by spreading idleness selfishness and rapacity for these evils have arisen not as an inevitable consequence of the principle but for want of judgment in framing laws based upon it and above all from faults in the mode of administering the law <\s>
<s> the mischief that has grown to such a height from granting relief in cases where proper vigilance would have shewn that it was not required or in bestowing it in undue measure will be urged by no truly enlightened statesman as a sufficient reason for banishing the principle itself from legislation <\s>
<s> let us recur to the miserable states of consciousness that it precludes <\s>
<s> there is a story told by a traveller in spain of a female who by a sudden shock of domestic calamity was driven out of her senses and ever after looked up incessantly to the sky feeling that her fellow creatures could do nothing for her relief <\s>
<s> can there be englishmen who with a good end in view would upon system expose their brother englishmen to a like necessity of looking upwards only or downwards to the earth after it shall contain no spot where the destitute can demand by civil right what by right of nature they are entitled to <\s>
<s> suppose the objects of our sympathy not sunk into this blank despair but wandering about as strangers in streets and ways with the hope of succour from casual charity what have we gained by such a change of scene <\s>
<s> woful is the condition of the famished northern indian dependent among winter snows upon the chance passage of a herd of deer from which one if brought down by his rifle gun may be made the means of keeping him and his companions alive <\s>
<s> as miserable is that of some savage islander who when the land has ceased to afford him sustenance watches for food which the waves may cast up or in vain endeavours to extract it from the inexplorable deep <\s>
<s> but neither of these is in a state of wretchedness comparable to that which is so often endured in civilised society multitudes in all ages have known it of whom may be said homeless near a thousand homes they stood and near a thousand tables pined and wanted food <\s>
<s> justly might i be accused of wasting time in an uncalled for attempt to excite the feelings of the reader if systems of political economy widely spread did not impugn the principle and if the safeguards against such extremities were left unimpaired <\s>
<s> it is broadly asserted by many that every man who endeavours to find work may find it <\s>
<s> were this assertion capable of being verified there still would remain a question what kind of work and how far may the labourer be fit for it <\s>
<s> for if sedentary work is to be exchanged for standing and some light and nice exercise of the fingers to which an artisan has been accustomed all his life for severe labour of the arms the best efforts would turn to little account and occasion would be given for the unthinking and the unfeeling unwarrantably to reproach those who are put upon such employment as idle froward and unworthy of relief either by law or in any other way <\s>
<s> were this statement correct there would indeed be an end of the argument the principle here maintained would be superseded <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise <\s>
<s> that principle applicable to the benefit of all countries is indispensable for england upon whose coast families are perpetually deprived of their support by shipwreck and where large masses of men are so liable to be thrown out of their ordinary means of gaining bread by changes in commercial intercourse subject mainly or solely to the will of foreign powers by new discoveries in arts and manufactures and by reckless laws in conformity with theories of political economy which whether right or wrong in the abstract have proved a scourge to tens of thousands by the abruptness with which they have been carried into practice <\s>
<s> but it is urged refuse altogether compulsory relief to the able bodied and the number of those who stand in need of relief will steadily diminish through a conviction of an absolute necessity for greater forethought and more prudent care of a man's earnings <\s>
<s> undoubtedly it would but so also would it and in a much greater degree if the legislative provisions were retained and parochial relief administered under the care of the upper classes as it ought to be <\s>
<s> for it has been invariably found that wherever the funds have been raised and applied under the superintendence of gentlemen and substantial proprietors acting in vestries and as overseers pauperism has diminished accordingly <\s>
<s> proper care in that quarter would effectually check what is felt in some districts to be one of the worst evils in the poor law system viz <\s>
<s> the readiness of small and needy proprietors to join in imposing rates that seemingly subject them to great hardships while in fact this is done with a mutual understanding that the relief each is ready to bestow upon his still poorer neighbours will be granted to himself or his relatives should it hereafter be applied for <\s>

<s> the readiness of small and needy proprietors to join in imposing rates that seemingly subject them to great hardships while in fact this is done with a mutual understanding that the relief each is ready to bestow upon his still poorer neighbours will be granted to himself or his relatives should it hereafter be applied for <\s>
<s> but let us look to inner sentiments of a nobler quality in order to know what we have to build upon <\s>
<s> affecting proofs occur in every one's experience who is acquainted with the unfortunate and the indigent of their unwillingness to derive their subsistence from aught but their own funds or labour or to be indebted to parochial assistance for the attainment of any object however dear to them <\s>
<s> a case was reported the other day from a coroner's inquest of a pair who through the space of four years had carried about their dead infant from house to house and from lodging to lodging as their necessities drove them rather than ask the parish to bear the expense of its interment the poor creatures lived in the hope of one day being able to bury their child at their own cost <\s>
<s> it must have been heart rending to see and hear the mother who had been called upon to account for the state in which the body was found make this deposition <\s>
<s> by some judging coldly if not harshly this conduct might be imputed to an unwarrantable pride as she and her husband had it is true been once in prosperity <\s>
<s> but examples where the spirit of independence works with equal strength though not with like miserable accompaniments are frequently to be found even yet among the humblest peasantry and mechanics <\s>
<s> there is not then sufficient cause for doubting that a like sense of honour may be revived among the people and their ancient habits of independence restored without resorting to those severities which the new poor law act has introduced <\s>
<s> but even if the surfaces of things only are to be examined we have a right to expect that lawgivers should take into account the various tempers and dispositions of mankind while some are led by the existence of a legislative provision into idleness and extravagance the economical virtues might be cherished in others by the knowledge that if all their efforts fail they have in the poor laws a refuge from the storm and a shadow from the heat <\s>
<s> despondency and distraction are no friends to prudence the springs of industry will relax if cheerfulness be destroyed by anxiety without hope men become reckless and have a sullen pride in adding to the heap of their own wretchedness <\s>
<s> he who feels that he is abandoned by his fellow men will be almost irresistibly driven to care little for himself will lose his self respect accordingly and with that loss what remains to him of virtue <\s>
<s> with all due deference to the particular experience and general intelligence of the individuals who framed the act and of those who in and out of parliament have approved of and supported it it may be said that it proceeds too much upon the presumption that it is a labouring man's own fault if he be not as the phrase is before hand with the world <\s>
<s> but the most prudent are liable to be thrown back by sickness cutting them off from labour and causing to them expense and who but has observed how distress creeps upon multitudes without misconduct of their own and merely from a gradual fall in the price of labour without a correspondent one in the price of provisions so that men who may have ventured upon the marriage state with a fair prospect of maintaining their families in comfort and happiness see them reduced to a pittance which no effort of theirs can increase <\s>
<s> let it be remembered also that there are thousands with whom vicious habits of expense are not the cause why they do not store up their gains but they are generous and kind hearted and ready to help their kindred and friends moreover they have a faith in providence that those who have been prompt to assist others will not be left destitute should they themselves come to need <\s>
<s> by acting from these blended feelings numbers have rendered themselves incapable of standing up against a sudden reverse <\s>
<s> nevertheless these men in common with all who have the misfortune to be in want if many theorists had their wish would be thrown upon one or other of those three sharp points of condition before adverted to from which the intervention of law has hitherto saved them <\s>
<s> all that has been said tends to show how the principle contended for makes the gift of life more valuable and has it may be hoped led to the conclusion that its legitimate operation is to make men worthier of that gift in other words not to degrade but to exalt human nature <\s>
<s> but the subject must not be dismissed without adverting to the indirect influence of the same principle upon the moral sentiments of a people among whom it is embodied in law <\s>
<s> in our criminal jurisprudence there is a maxim deservedly eulogised that it is better that ten guilty persons should escape than that one innocent man should suffer so also might it be maintained with regard to the poor laws that it is better for the interests of humanity among the people at large that ten undeserving should partake of the funds provided than that one morally good man through want of relief should either have his principles corrupted or his energies destroyed than that such a one should either be driven to do wrong or be cast to the earth in utter hopelessness <\s>
<s> in france the english maxim of criminal jurisprudence is reversed there it is deemed better that ten innocent men should suffer than one guilty escape in france there is no universal provision for the poor and we may judge of the small value set upon human life in the metropolis of that country by merely noticing the disrespect with which after death the body is treated not by the thoughtless vulgar but in schools of anatomy presided over by men allowed to be in their own art and in physical science among the most enlightened in the world <\s>
<s> in the east where countries are overrun with population as with a weed infinitely more respect is shown to the remains of the deceased and what a bitter mockery is it that this insensibility should be found where civil polity is so busy in minor regulations and ostentatiously careful to gratify the luxurious propensities whether social or intellectual of the multitude <\s>
<s> irreligion is no doubt much concerned with this offensive disrespect shown to the bodies of the dead in france but it is mainly attributable to the state in which so many of the living are left by the absence of compulsory provision for the indigent so humanely established by the law of england <\s>
<s> sights of abject misery perpetually recurring harden the heart of the community <\s>
<s> in the perusal of history and of works of fiction we are not indeed unwilling to have our commiseration excited by such objects of distress as they present to us but in the concerns of real life men know that such emotions are not given to be indulged for their own sakes there the conscience declares to them that sympathy must be followed by action and if there exist a previous conviction that the power to relieve is utterly inadequate to the demand the eye shrinks from communication with wretchedness and pity and compassion languish like any other qualities that are deprived of their natural aliment <\s>
<s> let these considerations be duly weighed by those who trust to the hope that an increase of private charity with all its advantages of superior discrimination would more than compensate for the abandonment of those principles the wisdom of which has been here insisted upon <\s>
<s> how discouraging also would be the sense of injustice which could not fail to arise in the minds of the well disposed if the burden of supporting the poor a burden of which the selfish have hitherto by compulsion borne a share should now or hereafter be thrown exclusively upon the benevolent <\s>
<s> by having put an end to the slave trade and slavery the british people are exalted in the scale of humanity and they cannot but feel so if they look into themselves and duly consider their relation to god and their fellow creatures <\s>
<s> that was a noble advance but a retrograde movement will assuredly be made if ever the principle which has been here defended should be either avowedly abandoned or but ostensibly retained <\s>
<s> but after all there may be a little reason to apprehend permanent injury from any experiment that may be tried <\s>
<s> on the one side will be human nature rising up in her own defence and on the other prudential selfishness acting to the same purpose from a conviction that without a compulsory provision for the exigencies of the labouring multitude that degree of ability to regulate the price of labour which is indispensable for the reasonable interest of arts and manufactures cannot in great britain be upheld <\s>
<s> in a poem of the foregoing collection allusion is made to the state of the workmen congregated in manufactories <\s>
<s> in order to relieve many of the evils to which that class of society are subject and to establish a better harmony between them and their employers it would be well to repeal such laws as prevent the formation of joint stock companies <\s>
<s> there are no doubt many and great obstacles to the formation and salutary working of these societies inherent in the mind of those whom they would obviously benefit <\s>
<s> but the combinations of masters to keep down unjustly the price of labour would be fairly checked by them as far as they were practicable they would encourage economy inasmuch as they would enable a man to draw profit from his savings by investing them in buildings or machinery for processes of manufacture with which he was habitually connected <\s>
<s> his little capital would then be working for him while he was at rest or asleep he would more clearly perceive the necessity of capital for carrying on great works he would better learn to respect the larger portions of it in the hands of others he would be less tempted to join in unjust combinations and for the sake of his own property if not for higher reasons he would be slow to promote local disturbance or endanger public tranquillity he would at least be loth to act in that way knowingly for it is not to be denied that such societies might be nurseries of opinions unfavourable to a mixed constitution of government like that of great britain <\s>
<s> the democratic and republican spirit which they might be apt to foster would not however be dangerous in itself but only as it might act without being sufficiently counterbalanced either by landed proprietorship or by a church extending itself so as to embrace an ever growing and ever shifting population of mechanics and artisans <\s>
<s> but if the tendencies of such societies would be to make the men prosper who might belong to them rulers and legislators should rejoice in the result and do their duty to the state by upholding and extending the influence of that church to which it owes in so great a measure its safety its prosperity and its glory <\s>
<s> this in the temper of the present times may be difficult but it is become indispensable since large towns in great numbers have sprung up and others have increased tenfold with little or no dependence upon the gentry and the landed proprietors and apart from those mitigated feudal institutions which till of late have acted so powerfully upon the composition of the house of commons <\s>
<s> now it may be affirmed that in quarters where there is not an attachment to the church or the landed aristocracy and a pride in supporting them there the people will dislike both and be ready upon such incitements as are perpetually recurring to join in attempts to overthrow them <\s>
<s> there is no neutral ground here from want of due attention to the state of society in large towns and manufacturing districts and ignorance or disregard of these obvious truths innumerable well meaning persons became zealous supporters of a reform bill the qualities and powers of which whether destructive or constructive they would otherwise have been afraid of and even the framers of that bill swayed as they might be by party resentments and personal ambition could not have gone so far had not they too been lamentably ignorant or neglectful of the same truths both of fact and philosophy <\s>
<s> but let that pass and let no opponent of the bill be tempted to compliment his own foresight by exaggerating the mischiefs and dangers that have sprung from it let not time be wasted in profitless regrets and let those party distinctions vanish to their very names that have separated men who whatever course they may have pursued have ever had a bond of union in the wish to save the limited monarchy and those other institutions that have under providence rendered for so long a period of time this country the happiest and worthiest of which there is any record since the foundation of civil society <\s>
<s> a philosophic mind is best pleased when looking at religion in its spiritual bearing as a guide of conduct a solace under affliction and a support amid the instabilities of mortal life but the church having been forcibly brought by political considerations to my notice while treating of the labouring classes i cannot forbear saying a few words upon that momentous topic <\s>

<s> a philosophic mind is best pleased when looking at religion in its spiritual bearing as a guide of conduct a solace under affliction and a support amid the instabilities of mortal life but the church having been forcibly brought by political considerations to my notice while treating of the labouring classes i cannot forbear saying a few words upon that momentous topic <\s>
<s> there is a loud clamour for extensive change in that department <\s>
<s> the clamour would be entitled to more respect if they who are the most eager to swell it with their voices were not generally the most ignorant of the real state of the church and the service it renders to the community <\s>
<s> reform is the word employed <\s>
<s> let us pause and consider what sense it is apt to carry and how things are confounded by a lax use of it <\s>
<s> the great religious reformation in the sixteenth century did not profess to be a new construction but a restoration of something fallen into decay or put out of sight <\s>
<s> that familiar and justifiable use of the word seems to have paved the way for fallacies with respect to the term reform which it is difficult to escape from <\s>
<s> were we to speak of improvement and the correction of abuses we should run less risk of being deceived ourselves or of misleading others <\s>
<s> we should be less likely to fall blindly into the belief that the change demanded is a renewal of something that has existed before and that therefore we have experience on our side nor should we be equally tempted to beg the question that the change for which we are eager must be advantageous <\s>
<s> from generation to generation men are the dupes of words and it is painful to observe that so many of our species are most tenacious of those opinions which they have formed with the least consideration <\s>
<s> of legislation for the poor the working classes and the clergy <\s>
<s> in the present volume as in those that have preceded it the reader will have found occasionally opinions expressed upon the course of public affairs and feelings given vent to as national interests excited them <\s>
<s> since nothing i trust has been uttered but in the spirit of reflective patriotism those notices are left to produce their own effect but among the many objects of general concern and the changes going forward which i have glanced at in verse are some especially affecting the lower orders of society in reference to these i wish here to add a few words in plain prose <\s>
<s> were i conscious of being able to do justice to those important topics i might avail myself of the periodical press for offering anonymously my thoughts such as they are to the world but i feel that in procuring attention they may derive some advantage however small from my name in addition to that of being presented in a less fugitive shape <\s>
<s> it is also not impossible that the state of mind which some of the foregoing poems may have produced in the reader will dispose him to receive more readily the impression which i desire to make and to admit the conclusions i would establish <\s>
<s> the first thing that presses upon my attention is the poor law amendment act <\s>
<s> i am aware of the magnitude and complexity of the subject and the unwearied attention which it has received from men of far wider experience than my own yet i cannot forbear touching upon one point of it and to this i will confine myself though not insensible to the objection which may reasonably be brought against treating a portion of this or any other great scheme of civil polity separately from the whole <\s>
<s> the point to which i wish to draw the reader's attention is that all persons who cannot find employment or procure wages sufficient to support the body in health and strength are entitled to a maintenance by law <\s>
<s> this dictate of humanity is acknowledged in the report of the commissioners but is there not room for apprehension that some of the regulations of the new act have a tendency to render the principle nugatory by difficulties thrown in the way of applying it <\s>
<s> if this be so persons will not be wanting to show it by examining the provisions of the act in detail an attempt which would be quite out of place here but it will not therefore be deemed unbecoming in one who fears that the prudence of the head may in framing some of those provisions have supplanted the wisdom of the heart to enforce a principle which cannot be violated without infringing upon one of the most precious rights of the english people and opposing one of the most sacred claims of civilised humanity <\s>
<s> there can be no greater error in this department of legislation than the belief that this principle does by necessity operate for the degradation of those who claim or are so circumstanced as to make it likely they may claim through laws founded upon it relief or assistance <\s>
<s> the direct contrary is the truth it may be unanswerably maintained that its tendency is to raise not to depress by stamping a value upon life which can belong to it only where the laws have placed men who are willing to work and yet cannot find employment above the necessity of looking for protection against hunger and other natural evils either to individual and casual charity to despair and death or to the breach of law by theft or violence <\s>
<s> and here as in the report of the commissioners the fundamental principle has been recognised i am not at issue with them any farther than i am compelled to believe that their remedial measures obstruct the application of it more than the interests of society require <\s>
<s> and calling to mind the doctrines of political economy which are now prevalent i cannot forbear to enforce the justice of the principle and to insist upon its salutary operation <\s>
<s> and first for its justice if self preservation be the first law of our nature would not every one in a state of nature be morally justified in taking to himself that which is indispensable to such preservation where by so doing he would not rob another of that which might be equally indispensable to his preservation <\s>
<s> and if the value of life be regarded in a right point of view may it not be questioned whether this right of preserving life at any expense short of endangering the life of another does not survive man's entering into the social state whether this right can be surrendered or forfeited except when it opposes the divine law upon any supposition of a social compact or of any convention for the protection of mere rights of property <\s>
<s> but if it be not safe to touch the abstract question of man's right in a social state to help himself even in the last extremity may we not still contend for the duty of a christian government standing in loco parentis towards all its subjects to make such effectual provision that no one shall be in danger of perishing either through the neglect or harshness of its legislation <\s>
<s> or waiving this is it not indisputable that the claim of the state to the allegiance involves the protection of the subject <\s>
<s> and as all rights in one party impose a correlative duty upon another it follows that the right of the state to require the services of its members even to the jeoparding of their lives in the common defence establishes a right in the people not to be gainsaid by utilitarians and economists to public support when from any cause they may be unable to support themselves <\s>
<s> let us now consider the salutary and benign operation of this principle <\s>
<s> here we must have recourse to elementary feelings of human nature and to truths which from their very obviousness are apt to be slighted till they are forced upon our notice by our own sufferings or those of others <\s>
<s> in the paradise lost milton represents adam after the fall as exclaiming in the anguish of his soul did i request thee maker from my clay to mould me man did i solicit thee from darkness to promote me <\s>
<s> my will concurred not to my being <\s>
<s> under how many various pressures of misery have men been driven thus in a strain touching upon impiety to expostulate with the creator <\s>
<s> and under few so afflictive as when the source and origin of earthly existence have been brought back to the mind by its impending close in the pangs of destitution <\s>
<s> but as long as in our legislation due weight shall be given to this principle no man will be forced to bewail the gift of life in hopeless want of the necessaries of life <\s>
<s> englishmen have therefore by the progress of civilisation among them been placed in circumstances more favourable to piety and resignation to the divine will than the inhabitants of other countries where a like provision has not been established <\s>
<s> and as providence in this care of our countrymen acts through a human medium the objects of that care must in like manner be more inclined towards a grateful love of their fellow men <\s>
<s> thus also do stronger ties attach the people to their country whether while they tread its soil or at a distance think of their native land as an indulgent parent to whose arms even they who have been imprudent and undeserving may like the prodigal son betake themselves without fear of being rejected <\s>
<s> such is the view of the case that would first present itself to a reflective mind and it is in vain to show by appeals to experience in contrast with this view that provisions founded upon the principle have promoted profaneness of life and dispositions the reverse of philanthropic by spreading idleness selfishness and rapacity for these evils have arisen not as an inevitable consequence of the principle but for want of judgment in framing laws based upon it and above all from faults in the mode of administering the law <\s>
<s> the mischief that has grown to such a height from granting relief in cases where proper vigilance would have shewn that it was not required or in bestowing it in undue measure will be urged by no truly enlightened statesman as a sufficient reason for banishing the principle itself from legislation <\s>
<s> let us recur to the miserable states of consciousness that it precludes <\s>
<s> there is a story told by a traveller in spain of a female who by a sudden shock of domestic calamity was driven out of her senses and ever after looked up incessantly to the sky feeling that her fellow creatures could do nothing for her relief <\s>
<s> can there be englishmen who with a good end in view would upon system expose their brother englishmen to a like necessity of looking upwards only or downwards to the earth after it shall contain no spot where the destitute can demand by civil right what by right of nature they are entitled to <\s>
<s> suppose the objects of our sympathy not sunk into this blank despair but wandering about as strangers in streets and ways with the hope of succour from casual charity what have we gained by such a change of scene <\s>
<s> woful is the condition of the famished northern indian dependent among winter snows upon the chance passage of a herd of deer from which one if brought down by his rifle gun may be made the means of keeping him and his companions alive <\s>
<s> as miserable is that of some savage islander who when the land has ceased to afford him sustenance watches for food which the waves may cast up or in vain endeavours to extract it from the inexplorable deep <\s>
<s> but neither of these is in a state of wretchedness comparable to that which is so often endured in civilised society multitudes in all ages have known it of whom may be said homeless near a thousand homes they stood and near a thousand tables pined and wanted food <\s>
<s> justly might i be accused of wasting time in an uncalled for attempt to excite the feelings of the reader if systems of political economy widely spread did not impugn the principle and if the safeguards against such extremities were left unimpaired <\s>
<s> it is broadly asserted by many that every man who endeavours to find work may find it <\s>
<s> were this assertion capable of being verified there still would remain a question what kind of work and how far may the labourer be fit for it <\s>
<s> for if sedentary work is to be exchanged for standing and some light and nice exercise of the fingers to which an artisan has been accustomed all his life for severe labour of the arms the best efforts would turn to little account and occasion would be given for the unthinking and the unfeeling unwarrantably to reproach those who are put upon such employment as idle froward and unworthy of relief either by law or in any other way <\s>
<s> were this statement correct there would indeed be an end of the argument the principle here maintained would be superseded <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise <\s>
<s> that principle applicable to the benefit of all countries is indispensable for england upon whose coast families are perpetually deprived of their support by shipwreck and where large masses of men are so liable to be thrown out of their ordinary means of gaining bread by changes in commercial intercourse subject mainly or solely to the will of foreign powers by new discoveries in arts and manufactures and by reckless laws in conformity with theories of political economy which whether right or wrong in the abstract have proved a scourge to tens of thousands by the abruptness with which they have been carried into practice <\s>
<s> but it is urged refuse altogether compulsory relief to the able bodied and the number of those who stand in need of relief will steadily diminish through a conviction of an absolute necessity for greater forethought and more prudent care of a man's earnings <\s>
<s> undoubtedly it would but so also would it and in a much greater degree if the legislative provisions were retained and parochial relief administered under the care of the upper classes as it ought to be <\s>
<s> for it has been invariably found that wherever the funds have been raised and applied under the superintendence of gentlemen and substantial proprietors acting in vestries and as overseers pauperism has diminished accordingly <\s>
<s> proper care in that quarter would effectually check what is felt in some districts to be one of the worst evils in the poor law system viz <\s>

<s> were this statement correct there would indeed be an end of the argument the principle here maintained would be superseded <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise <\s>
<s> that principle applicable to the benefit of all countries is indispensable for england upon whose coast families are perpetually deprived of their support by shipwreck and where large masses of men are so liable to be thrown out of their ordinary means of gaining bread by changes in commercial intercourse subject mainly or solely to the will of foreign powers by new discoveries in arts and manufactures and by reckless laws in conformity with theories of political economy which whether right or wrong in the abstract have proved a scourge to tens of thousands by the abruptness with which they have been carried into practice <\s>
<s> but it is urged refuse altogether compulsory relief to the able bodied and the number of those who stand in need of relief will steadily diminish through a conviction of an absolute necessity for greater forethought and more prudent care of a man's earnings <\s>
<s> undoubtedly it would but so also would it and in a much greater degree if the legislative provisions were retained and parochial relief administered under the care of the upper classes as it ought to be <\s>
<s> for it has been invariably found that wherever the funds have been raised and applied under the superintendence of gentlemen and substantial proprietors acting in vestries and as overseers pauperism has diminished accordingly <\s>
<s> proper care in that quarter would effectually check what is felt in some districts to be one of the worst evils in the poor law system viz <\s>
<s> the readiness of small and needy proprietors to join in imposing rates that seemingly subject them to great hardships while in fact this is done with a mutual understanding that the relief each is ready to bestow upon his still poorer neighbours will be granted to himself or his relatives should it hereafter be applied for <\s>
<s> but let us look to inner sentiments of a nobler quality in order to know what we have to build upon <\s>
<s> affecting proofs occur in every one's experience who is acquainted with the unfortunate and the indigent of their unwillingness to derive their subsistence from aught but their own funds or labour or to be indebted to parochial assistance for the attainment of any object however dear to them <\s>
<s> a case was reported the other day from a coroner's inquest of a pair who through the space of four years had carried about their dead infant from house to house and from lodging to lodging as their necessities drove them rather than ask the parish to bear the expense of its interment the poor creatures lived in the hope of one day being able to bury their child at their own cost <\s>
<s> it must have been heart rending to see and hear the mother who had been called upon to account for the state in which the body was found make this deposition <\s>
<s> by some judging coldly if not harshly this conduct might be imputed to an unwarrantable pride as she and her husband had it is true been once in prosperity <\s>
<s> but examples where the spirit of independence works with equal strength though not with like miserable accompaniments are frequently to be found even yet among the humblest peasantry and mechanics <\s>
<s> there is not then sufficient cause for doubting that a like sense of honour may be revived among the people and their ancient habits of independence restored without resorting to those severities which the new poor law act has introduced <\s>
<s> but even if the surfaces of things only are to be examined we have a right to expect that lawgivers should take into account the various tempers and dispositions of mankind while some are led by the existence of a legislative provision into idleness and extravagance the economical virtues might be cherished in others by the knowledge that if all their efforts fail they have in the poor laws a refuge from the storm and a shadow from the heat <\s>
<s> despondency and distraction are no friends to prudence the springs of industry will relax if cheerfulness be destroyed by anxiety without hope men become reckless and have a sullen pride in adding to the heap of their own wretchedness <\s>
<s> he who feels that he is abandoned by his fellow men will be almost irresistibly driven to care little for himself will lose his self respect accordingly and with that loss what remains to him of virtue <\s>
<s> with all due deference to the particular experience and general intelligence of the individuals who framed the act and of those who in and out of parliament have approved of and supported it it may be said that it proceeds too much upon the presumption that it is a labouring man's own fault if he be not as the phrase is before hand with the world <\s>
<s> but the most prudent are liable to be thrown back by sickness cutting them off from labour and causing to them expense and who but has observed how distress creeps upon multitudes without misconduct of their own and merely from a gradual fall in the price of labour without a correspondent one in the price of provisions so that men who may have ventured upon the marriage state with a fair prospect of maintaining their families in comfort and happiness see them reduced to a pittance which no effort of theirs can increase <\s>
<s> let it be remembered also that there are thousands with whom vicious habits of expense are not the cause why they do not store up their gains but they are generous and kind hearted and ready to help their kindred and friends moreover they have a faith in providence that those who have been prompt to assist others will not be left destitute should they themselves come to need <\s>
<s> by acting from these blended feelings numbers have rendered themselves incapable of standing up against a sudden reverse <\s>
<s> nevertheless these men in common with all who have the misfortune to be in want if many theorists had their wish would be thrown upon one or other of those three sharp points of condition before adverted to from which the intervention of law has hitherto saved them <\s>
<s> all that has been said tends to show how the principle contended for makes the gift of life more valuable and has it may be hoped led to the conclusion that its legitimate operation is to make men worthier of that gift in other words not to degrade but to exalt human nature <\s>
<s> but the subject must not be dismissed without adverting to the indirect influence of the same principle upon the moral sentiments of a people among whom it is embodied in law <\s>
<s> in our criminal jurisprudence there is a maxim deservedly eulogised that it is better that ten guilty persons should escape than that one innocent man should suffer so also might it be maintained with regard to the poor laws that it is better for the interests of humanity among the people at large that ten undeserving should partake of the funds provided than that one morally good man through want of relief should either have his principles corrupted or his energies destroyed than that such a one should either be driven to do wrong or be cast to the earth in utter hopelessness <\s>
<s> in france the english maxim of criminal jurisprudence is reversed there it is deemed better that ten innocent men should suffer than one guilty escape in france there is no universal provision for the poor and we may judge of the small value set upon human life in the metropolis of that country by merely noticing the disrespect with which after death the body is treated not by the thoughtless vulgar but in schools of anatomy presided over by men allowed to be in their own art and in physical science among the most enlightened in the world <\s>
<s> in the east where countries are overrun with population as with a weed infinitely more respect is shown to the remains of the deceased and what a bitter mockery is it that this insensibility should be found where civil polity is so busy in minor regulations and ostentatiously careful to gratify the luxurious propensities whether social or intellectual of the multitude <\s>
<s> irreligion is no doubt much concerned with this offensive disrespect shown to the bodies of the dead in france but it is mainly attributable to the state in which so many of the living are left by the absence of compulsory provision for the indigent so humanely established by the law of england <\s>
<s> sights of abject misery perpetually recurring harden the heart of the community <\s>
<s> in the perusal of history and of works of fiction we are not indeed unwilling to have our commiseration excited by such objects of distress as they present to us but in the concerns of real life men know that such emotions are not given to be indulged for their own sakes there the conscience declares to them that sympathy must be followed by action and if there exist a previous conviction that the power to relieve is utterly inadequate to the demand the eye shrinks from communication with wretchedness and pity and compassion languish like any other qualities that are deprived of their natural aliment <\s>
<s> let these considerations be duly weighed by those who trust to the hope that an increase of private charity with all its advantages of superior discrimination would more than compensate for the abandonment of those principles the wisdom of which has been here insisted upon <\s>
<s> how discouraging also would be the sense of injustice which could not fail to arise in the minds of the well disposed if the burden of supporting the poor a burden of which the selfish have hitherto by compulsion borne a share should now or hereafter be thrown exclusively upon the benevolent <\s>
<s> by having put an end to the slave trade and slavery the british people are exalted in the scale of humanity and they cannot but feel so if they look into themselves and duly consider their relation to god and their fellow creatures <\s>
<s> that was a noble advance but a retrograde movement will assuredly be made if ever the principle which has been here defended should be either avowedly abandoned or but ostensibly retained <\s>
<s> but after all there may be a little reason to apprehend permanent injury from any experiment that may be tried <\s>
<s> on the one side will be human nature rising up in her own defence and on the other prudential selfishness acting to the same purpose from a conviction that without a compulsory provision for the exigencies of the labouring multitude that degree of ability to regulate the price of labour which is indispensable for the reasonable interest of arts and manufactures cannot in great britain be upheld <\s>
<s> in a poem of the foregoing collection allusion is made to the state of the workmen congregated in manufactories <\s>
<s> in order to relieve many of the evils to which that class of society are subject and to establish a better harmony between them and their employers it would be well to repeal such laws as prevent the formation of joint stock companies <\s>
<s> there are no doubt many and great obstacles to the formation and salutary working of these societies inherent in the mind of those whom they would obviously benefit <\s>
<s> but the combinations of masters to keep down unjustly the price of labour would be fairly checked by them as far as they were practicable they would encourage economy inasmuch as they would enable a man to draw profit from his savings by investing them in buildings or machinery for processes of manufacture with which he was habitually connected <\s>
<s> his little capital would then be working for him while he was at rest or asleep he would more clearly perceive the necessity of capital for carrying on great works he would better learn to respect the larger portions of it in the hands of others he would be less tempted to join in unjust combinations and for the sake of his own property if not for higher reasons he would be slow to promote local disturbance or endanger public tranquillity he would at least be loth to act in that way knowingly for it is not to be denied that such societies might be nurseries of opinions unfavourable to a mixed constitution of government like that of great britain <\s>
<s> the democratic and republican spirit which they might be apt to foster would not however be dangerous in itself but only as it might act without being sufficiently counterbalanced either by landed proprietorship or by a church extending itself so as to embrace an ever growing and ever shifting population of mechanics and artisans <\s>
<s> but if the tendencies of such societies would be to make the men prosper who might belong to them rulers and legislators should rejoice in the result and do their duty to the state by upholding and extending the influence of that church to which it owes in so great a measure its safety its prosperity and its glory <\s>
<s> this in the temper of the present times may be difficult but it is become indispensable since large towns in great numbers have sprung up and others have increased tenfold with little or no dependence upon the gentry and the landed proprietors and apart from those mitigated feudal institutions which till of late have acted so powerfully upon the composition of the house of commons <\s>
<s> now it may be affirmed that in quarters where there is not an attachment to the church or the landed aristocracy and a pride in supporting them there the people will dislike both and be ready upon such incitements as are perpetually recurring to join in attempts to overthrow them <\s>

<s> for if sedentary work is to be exchanged for standing and some light and nice exercise of the fingers to which an artisan has been accustomed all his life for severe labour of the arms the best efforts would turn to little account and occasion would be given for the unthinking and the unfeeling unwarrantably to reproach those who are put upon such employment as idle froward and unworthy of relief either by law or in any other way <\s>
<s> were this statement correct there would indeed be an end of the argument the principle here maintained would be superseded <\s>
<s> it is far otherwise <\s>
<s> that principle applicable to the benefit of all countries is indispensable for england upon whose coast families are perpetually deprived of their support by shipwreck and where large masses of men are so liable to be thrown out of their ordinary means of gaining bread by changes in commercial intercourse subject mainly or solely to the will of foreign powers by new discoveries in arts and manufactures and by reckless laws in conformity with theories of political economy which whether right or wrong in the abstract have proved a scourge to tens of thousands by the abruptness with which they have been carried into practice <\s>
<s> but it is urged refuse altogether compulsory relief to the able bodied and the number of those who stand in need of relief will steadily diminish through a conviction of an absolute necessity for greater forethought and more prudent care of a man's earnings <\s>
<s> undoubtedly it would but so also would it and in a much greater degree if the legislative provisions were retained and parochial relief administered under the care of the upper classes as it ought to be <\s>
<s> for it has been invariably found that wherever the funds have been raised and applied under the superintendence of gentlemen and substantial proprietors acting in vestries and as overseers pauperism has diminished accordingly <\s>
<s> proper care in that quarter would effectually check what is felt in some districts to be one of the worst evils in the poor law system viz <\s>
<s> the readiness of small and needy proprietors to join in imposing rates that seemingly subject them to great hardships while in fact this is done with a mutual understanding that the relief each is ready to bestow upon his still poorer neighbours will be granted to himself or his relatives should it hereafter be applied for <\s>
<s> but let us look to inner sentiments of a nobler quality in order to know what we have to build upon <\s>
<s> affecting proofs occur in every one's experience who is acquainted with the unfortunate and the indigent of their unwillingness to derive their subsistence from aught but their own funds or labour or to be indebted to parochial assistance for the attainment of any object however dear to them <\s>
<s> a case was reported the other day from a coroner's inquest of a pair who through the space of four years had carried about their dead infant from house to house and from lodging to lodging as their necessities drove them rather than ask the parish to bear the expense of its interment the poor creatures lived in the hope of one day being able to bury their child at their own cost <\s>
<s> it must have been heart rending to see and hear the mother who had been called upon to account for the state in which the body was found make this deposition <\s>
<s> by some judging coldly if not harshly this conduct might be imputed to an unwarrantable pride as she and her husband had it is true been once in prosperity <\s>
<s> but examples where the spirit of independence works with equal strength though not with like miserable accompaniments are frequently to be found even yet among the humblest peasantry and mechanics <\s>
<s> there is not then sufficient cause for doubting that a like sense of honour may be revived among the people and their ancient habits of independence restored without resorting to those severities which the new poor law act has introduced <\s>
<s> but even if the surfaces of things only are to be examined we have a right to expect that lawgivers should take into account the various tempers and dispositions of mankind while some are led by the existence of a legislative provision into idleness and extravagance the economical virtues might be cherished in others by the knowledge that if all their efforts fail they have in the poor laws a refuge from the storm and a shadow from the heat <\s>
<s> despondency and distraction are no friends to prudence the springs of industry will relax if cheerfulness be destroyed by anxiety without hope men become reckless and have a sullen pride in adding to the heap of their own wretchedness <\s>
<s> he who feels that he is abandoned by his fellow men will be almost irresistibly driven to care little for himself will lose his self respect accordingly and with that loss what remains to him of virtue <\s>
<s> with all due deference to the particular experience and general intelligence of the individuals who framed the act and of those who in and out of parliament have approved of and supported it it may be said that it proceeds too much upon the presumption that it is a labouring man's own fault if he be not as the phrase is before hand with the world <\s>
<s> but the most prudent are liable to be thrown back by sickness cutting them off from labour and causing to them expense and who but has observed how distress creeps upon multitudes without misconduct of their own and merely from a gradual fall in the price of labour without a correspondent one in the price of provisions so that men who may have ventured upon the marriage state with a fair prospect of maintaining their families in comfort and happiness see them reduced to a pittance which no effort of theirs can increase <\s>
<s> let it be remembered also that there are thousands with whom vicious habits of expense are not the cause why they do not store up their gains but they are generous and kind hearted and ready to help their kindred and friends moreover they have a faith in providence that those who have been prompt to assist others will not be left destitute should they themselves come to need <\s>
<s> by acting from these blended feelings numbers have rendered themselves incapable of standing up against a sudden reverse <\s>
<s> nevertheless these men in common with all who have the misfortune to be in want if many theorists had their wish would be thrown upon one or other of those three sharp points of condition before adverted to from which the intervention of law has hitherto saved them <\s>
<s> all that has been said tends to show how the principle contended for makes the gift of life more valuable and has it may be hoped led to the conclusion that its legitimate operation is to make men worthier of that gift in other words not to degrade but to exalt human nature <\s>
<s> but the subject must not be dismissed without adverting to the indirect influence of the same principle upon the moral sentiments of a people among whom it is embodied in law <\s>
<s> in our criminal jurisprudence there is a maxim deservedly eulogised that it is better that ten guilty persons should escape than that one innocent man should suffer so also might it be maintained with regard to the poor laws that it is better for the interests of humanity among the people at large that ten undeserving should partake of the funds provided than that one morally good man through want of relief should either have his principles corrupted or his energies destroyed than that such a one should either be driven to do wrong or be cast to the earth in utter hopelessness <\s>
<s> in france the english maxim of criminal jurisprudence is reversed there it is deemed better that ten innocent men should suffer than one guilty escape in france there is no universal provision for the poor and we may judge of the small value set upon human life in the metropolis of that country by merely noticing the disrespect with which after death the body is treated not by the thoughtless vulgar but in schools of anatomy presided over by men allowed to be in their own art and in physical science among the most enlightened in the world <\s>
<s> in the east where countries are overrun with population as with a weed infinitely more respect is shown to the remains of the deceased and what a bitter mockery is it that this insensibility should be found where civil polity is so busy in minor regulations and ostentatiously careful to gratify the luxurious propensities whether social or intellectual of the multitude <\s>
<s> irreligion is no doubt much concerned with this offensive disrespect shown to the bodies of the dead in france but it is mainly attributable to the state in which so many of the living are left by the absence of compulsory provision for the indigent so humanely established by the law of england <\s>
<s> sights of abject misery perpetually recurring harden the heart of the community <\s>
<s> in the perusal of history and of works of fiction we are not indeed unwilling to have our commiseration excited by such objects of distress as they present to us but in the concerns of real life men know that such emotions are not given to be indulged for their own sakes there the conscience declares to them that sympathy must be followed by action and if there exist a previous conviction that the power to relieve is utterly inadequate to the demand the eye shrinks from communication with wretchedness and pity and compassion languish like any other qualities that are deprived of their natural aliment <\s>
<s> let these considerations be duly weighed by those who trust to the hope that an increase of private charity with all its advantages of superior discrimination would more than compensate for the abandonment of those principles the wisdom of which has been here insisted upon <\s>
<s> how discouraging also would be the sense of injustice which could not fail to arise in the minds of the well disposed if the burden of supporting the poor a burden of which the selfish have hitherto by compulsion borne a share should now or hereafter be thrown exclusively upon the benevolent <\s>
<s> by having put an end to the slave trade and slavery the british people are exalted in the scale of humanity and they cannot but feel so if they look into themselves and duly consider their relation to god and their fellow creatures <\s>
<s> that was a noble advance but a retrograde movement will assuredly be made if ever the principle which has been here defended should be either avowedly abandoned or but ostensibly retained <\s>
<s> but after all there may be a little reason to apprehend permanent injury from any experiment that may be tried <\s>
<s> on the one side will be human nature rising up in her own defence and on the other prudential selfishness acting to the same purpose from a conviction that without a compulsory provision for the exigencies of the labouring multitude that degree of ability to regulate the price of labour which is indispensable for the reasonable interest of arts and manufactures cannot in great britain be upheld <\s>
<s> in a poem of the foregoing collection allusion is made to the state of the workmen congregated in manufactories <\s>
<s> in order to relieve many of the evils to which that class of society are subject and to establish a better harmony between them and their employers it would be well to repeal such laws as prevent the formation of joint stock companies <\s>
<s> there are no doubt many and great obstacles to the formation and salutary working of these societies inherent in the mind of those whom they would obviously benefit <\s>
<s> but the combinations of masters to keep down unjustly the price of labour would be fairly checked by them as far as they were practicable they would encourage economy inasmuch as they would enable a man to draw profit from his savings by investing them in buildings or machinery for processes of manufacture with which he was habitually connected <\s>
<s> his little capital would then be working for him while he was at rest or asleep he would more clearly perceive the necessity of capital for carrying on great works he would better learn to respect the larger portions of it in the hands of others he would be less tempted to join in unjust combinations and for the sake of his own property if not for higher reasons he would be slow to promote local disturbance or endanger public tranquillity he would at least be loth to act in that way knowingly for it is not to be denied that such societies might be nurseries of opinions unfavourable to a mixed constitution of government like that of great britain <\s>
<s> the democratic and republican spirit which they might be apt to foster would not however be dangerous in itself but only as it might act without being sufficiently counterbalanced either by landed proprietorship or by a church extending itself so as to embrace an ever growing and ever shifting population of mechanics and artisans <\s>
<s> but if the tendencies of such societies would be to make the men prosper who might belong to them rulers and legislators should rejoice in the result and do their duty to the state by upholding and extending the influence of that church to which it owes in so great a measure its safety its prosperity and its glory <\s>
<s> this in the temper of the present times may be difficult but it is become indispensable since large towns in great numbers have sprung up and others have increased tenfold with little or no dependence upon the gentry and the landed proprietors and apart from those mitigated feudal institutions which till of late have acted so powerfully upon the composition of the house of commons <\s>
<s> now it may be affirmed that in quarters where there is not an attachment to the church or the landed aristocracy and a pride in supporting them there the people will dislike both and be ready upon such incitements as are perpetually recurring to join in attempts to overthrow them <\s>
<s> there is no neutral ground here from want of due attention to the state of society in large towns and manufacturing districts and ignorance or disregard of these obvious truths innumerable well meaning persons became zealous supporters of a reform bill the qualities and powers of which whether destructive or constructive they would otherwise have been afraid of and even the framers of that bill swayed as they might be by party resentments and personal ambition could not have gone so far had not they too been lamentably ignorant or neglectful of the same truths both of fact and philosophy <\s>
<s> but let that pass and let no opponent of the bill be tempted to compliment his own foresight by exaggerating the mischiefs and dangers that have sprung from it let not time be wasted in profitless regrets and let those party distinctions vanish to their very names that have separated men who whatever course they may have pursued have ever had a bond of union in the wish to save the limited monarchy and those other institutions that have under providence rendered for so long a period of time this country the happiest and worthiest of which there is any record since the foundation of civil society <\s>
<s> a philosophic mind is best pleased when looking at religion in its spiritual bearing as a guide of conduct a solace under affliction and a support amid the instabilities of mortal life but the church having been forcibly brought by political considerations to my notice while treating of the labouring classes i cannot forbear saying a few words upon that momentous topic <\s>
<s> there is a loud clamour for extensive change in that department <\s>
<s> the clamour would be entitled to more respect if they who are the most eager to swell it with their voices were not generally the most ignorant of the real state of the church and the service it renders to the community <\s>
<s> reform is the word employed <\s>
<s> let us pause and consider what sense it is apt to carry and how things are confounded by a lax use of it <\s>
<s> the great religious reformation in the sixteenth century did not profess to be a new construction but a restoration of something fallen into decay or put out of sight <\s>
<s> that familiar and justifiable use of the word seems to have paved the way for fallacies with respect to the term reform which it is difficult to escape from <\s>
<s> were we to speak of improvement and the correction of abuses we should run less risk of being deceived ourselves or of misleading others <\s>
<s> we should be less likely to fall blindly into the belief that the change demanded is a renewal of something that has existed before and that therefore we have experience on our side nor should we be equally tempted to beg the question that the change for which we are eager must be advantageous <\s>
<s> from generation to generation men are the dupes of words and it is painful to observe that so many of our species are most tenacious of those opinions which they have formed with the least consideration <\s>

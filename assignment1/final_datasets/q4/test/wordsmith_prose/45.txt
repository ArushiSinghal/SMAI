<s> i think buchanan's maiae calendae equal in sentiment if not in elegance to anything in horace but your brother charles to whom i repeated it the other day pointed out a false quantity in it 257 <\s>
<s> happily this had escaped me <\s>
<s> 257 if i remember right it is in the third line ludisque dicatae jocisque a strange blunder for buchanan must have read horace's quid dedicatum poscit apolliuem a hundred times <\s>
<s> when i began to give myself up to the profession of a poet for life i was impressed with a conviction that there were four english poets whom i must have continually before me as examples chaucer shakspeare spenser and milton <\s>
<s> these i must study and equal if i could and i need not think of the rest 258 <\s>
<s> 258 this paragraph was communicated by mr <\s>
<s> i have been charged by some with disparaging pope and dryden <\s>
<s> this is not so <\s>
<s> i have committed much of both to memory <\s>
<s> as far as pope goes he succeeds but his homer is not homer but pope <\s>
<s> i cannot account for shakspeare's low estimate of his own writings except from the sublimity the superhumanity of his genius <\s>
<s> they were infinitely below his conception of what they might have been and ought to have been <\s>
<s> the mind often does not think when it thinks that it is thinking <\s>
<s> if we were to give our whole soul to anything as the bee does to the flower i conceive there would be little difficulty in any intellectual employment <\s>
<s> hence there is no excuse for obscurity in writing <\s>
<s> macbeth is the best conducted of shakspeare's plays <\s>
<s> the fault of julius caesar hamlet and lear is that the interest is not and by the nature of the case could not be sustained to their conclusion <\s>
<s> the death of julius caesar is too overwhelming an incident for any stage of the drama but the last <\s>
<s> it is an incident to which the mind clings and from which it will not be torn away to share in other sorrows <\s>
<s> the same may be said of the madness of lear <\s>
<s> again the opening of hamlet is full of exhausting interest <\s>
<s> there is more mind in hamlet than in any other play more knowledge of human nature <\s>
<s> the first act is incomparable .... <\s>
<s> there is too much of an every day sick room in the death bed scene of catherine in henry the eighth' too much of leeches and apothecaries vials .... <\s>
<s> zanga is a bad imitation of othello <\s>
<s> garrick never ventured on othello he could not submit to a blacked face <\s>
<s> he rehearsed the part once <\s>
<s> during the rehearsal quin entered and having listened for some time with attention exclaimed well done david <\s>
<s> but where's the teakettle <\s>
<s> alluding to the print of hogarth where a black boy follows his mistress with a teakettle in his hand .... <\s>
<s> in stature garrick was short .... <\s>
<s> a fact which conveys a high notion of his powers is that he was able to act out the absurd stage costume of those days <\s>
<s> he represented coriolanus in the attire of cheapside <\s>
<s> i remember hearing from sir g <\s>
<s> beaumont that while he was venting as lear the violent paroxysms of his rage in the awful tempest scene his wig happened to fall off <\s>
<s> the accident did not produce the slightest effect on the gravity of the house so strongly had he impregnated every breast with his own emotions <\s>
<s> some of my friends h c <\s>
<s> for instance doubt whether poetry on contemporary persons and events can be good <\s>
<s> but i instance spenser's marriage and milton's lycidas <\s>
<s> true the persae is one of the worst of aeschylus's plays at least in my opinion <\s>
<s> milton is falsely represented by some as a democrat <\s>
<s> he was an aristocrat in the truest sense of the word <\s>
<s> see the quotation from him in my convention of cintra 259 indeed he spoke in very proud and contemptuous terms of the populace <\s>
<s> comus is rich in beautiful and sweet flowers and in exuberant leaves of genius but the ripe and mellow fruit is in samson agonistes <\s>
<s> when he wrote that his mind was hebraized <\s>
<s> indeed his genius fed on the writings of the hebrew prophets <\s>
<s> this arose in some degree from the temper of the times the puritan lived in the old testament almost to the exclusion of the new <\s>
<s> the works of the old english dramatists are the gardens of our language <\s>
<s> one of the noblest things in milton is the description of that sweet quiet morning in the paradise regained after that terrible night of howling wind and storm <\s>
<s> the contrast is divine 260 259 page 174 vol <\s>
<s> i where milton speaks of the evils suffered by a nation unless men more than vulgar bred up in the knowledge of ancient and illustrious deeds conduct its affairs <\s>
<s> 260 paradise regained iv <\s>
<s> what a virulent democrat is <\s>
<s> a man ill at ease with his own conscience is sure to quarrel with all government order and law <\s>
<s> the influence of locke's essay was not due to its own merits which are considerable but to external circumstances <\s>
<s> it came forth at a happy opportunity and coincided with the prevalent opinions of the time <\s>
<s> the jesuit doctrines concerning the papal power in deposing kings and absolving subjects from their allegiance had driven some protestant theologians to take refuge in the theory of the divine right of kings <\s>
<s> this theory was unpalatable to the world at large and others invented the more popular doctrine of a social contract in its place a doctrine which history refutes <\s>
<s> but locke did what he could to accommodate this principle to his own system <\s>
<s> the only basis on which property can rest is right derived from prescription <\s>
<s> the best of locke's works as it seems to me is that in which he attempts the least his conduct of the understanding <\s>
<s> in the summer of 1827 speaking of some of his contemporaries wordsworth said t <\s>
<s> moore has great natural genius but he is too lavish of brilliant ornament <\s>
<s> his poems smell of the perfumer's and milliner's shops <\s>
<s> he is not content with a ring and a bracelet but he must have rings in the ears rings on the nose rings everywhere <\s>
<s> walter scott is not a careful composer <\s>
<s> he allows himself many liberties which betray a want of respect for his reader <\s>
<s> for instance he is too fond of inversions i e he often places the verb before the substantive and the accusative before the verb <\s>
<s> scott quoted as from me the swan on sweet st <\s>
<s> mary's lake floats double swan and shadow instead of still thus obscuring my idea and betraying his own uncritical principles of composition <\s>
<s> byron seems to me deficient in feeling <\s>
<s> professor wilson i think used to say that beppo was his best poem because all his faults were there brought to a height <\s>
<s> i never read the english bards through <\s>
<s> his critical prognostications have for the most part proved erroneous <\s>
<s> sir james mackintosh said of me to m <\s>
<s> de staël wordsworth is not a great poet but he is the greatest man among poets <\s>
<s> madame de staël complained of my style <\s>
<s> now whatever may be the result of my experiment in the subjects which i have chosen for poetical composition be they vulgar or be they not i can say without vanity that i have bestowed great pains on my style full as much as any of my contemporaries have done on theirs <\s>

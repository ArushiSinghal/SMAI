<s> the moment we opened the door the waterfall was before us the summer house being so placed as to occupy the exact spot from which it was to be seen the rocks and shrubbery around closing it in on every side <\s>

<s> he remarked he had once seen a volume of his poems published in an american newspaper <\s>
<s> i happened to have in my pocket the small volume of selections which you made some years ago <\s>
<s> i produced it and asked at the same time if he had ever seen it <\s>
<s> he replied he had not <\s>
<s> he took it with evident interest turned to the title page which he read with its motto <\s>
<s> he began the preface then in the same way <\s>
<s> but here i must record a trifling incident which may yet be worth noting <\s>
<s> we were standing together in the road wordsworth reading aloud as i have said when a man accosted us asking charity a beggar of the better class <\s>
<s> wordsworth scarcely looking off the book thrust his hands into his pockets as if instinctively acknowledging the man's right to beg by this prompt action <\s>
<s> inman's portrait of the poet your gift to mrs <\s>
<s> wordsworth being a copy of the one painted for you had a conspicuous place <\s>
<s> the portrait of bishop white also your gift the engraving from inman's picture i also noticed <\s>
<s> i could have waited patiently for a long time indulging the thoughts which the place called up <\s>
<s> in a few minutes however i heard steps in the entry the door was opened and wordsworth came in it could be no other a tall figure a little bent with age his hair thin and grey and his face deeply wrinkled .... <\s>
<s> the expression of his countenance was sad mournful i might say he seemed one on whom sorrow pressed heavily <\s>
<s> he gave me his hand and welcomed me cordially though without smiling <\s>
<s> will you walk out sir and join us at the table <\s>
<s> i am engaged to dine elsewhere <\s>
<s> but you can sit with us said he so leading the way he conducted me to the dining room <\s>
<s> at the head of the table sat mrs <\s>
<s> wordsworth and their three grandchildren made up the party .... <\s>
<s> it was a humble apartment not ceiled the rafters being visible having a large old fashioned chimney place with a high mantelpiece <\s>
<s> wordsworth asked after mr <\s>
<s> ticknor of boston who had visited him a few months before and for whom he expressed much regard <\s>
<s> some other questions led me to speak of the progress we were making in america in the extension of our territory the settlements on the pacific c all this involving the rapid spread of our english tongue <\s>
<s> wordsworth at this looked up and i noticed a fixing of his eye as if on some remote object <\s>
<s> he said that considering this extension of our language it behoved those who wrote to see to it that what they put forth was on the side of virtue <\s>
<s> this remark although thrown out at the moment was made in a serious thoughtful way and i was much impressed by it <\s>
<s> i could not but reflect that to him a deep sense of responsibility had ever been present to purify and elevate has been the purpose of all his writings <\s>
<s> such may have been at that moment his own inward meditation and he may have had in mind the coming generations who are to dwell upon his words <\s>
<s> queen victoria was mentioned her visit to ireland which had just been made the courage she had shown <\s>
<s> that is a virtue said he which she has to a remarkable degree which is very much to her credit <\s>
<s> inman's portrait of him i alluded to as being very familiar to me the copy which hung in the room calling it to mind which led him to speak of the one painted by pickersgill for st <\s>
<s> i was a member of that college he said and the fellows and students did me the honour to ask me to sit and allowed me to choose the artist <\s>
<s> i wrote to mr <\s>
<s> rogers on the subject and he recommended pickersgill who came down soon afterwards and the picture was painted here <\s>
<s> he believed he had sat twenty three times <\s>
<s> my impression is he was in doubt whether inman's or pickersgill's portrait was the better one <\s>
<s> he spoke with great animation of the advantage of classical study greek especially <\s>
<s> where said he would one look for a greater orator than demosthenes or finer dramatic poetry next to shakspeare than that of aeschylus and sophocles not to speak of euripides <\s>
<s> herodotus he thought the most interesting and instructive book next to the bible which had ever been written <\s>
<s> modern discoveries had only tended to confirm the general truth of his narrative <\s>
<s> thucydides he thought less of <\s>
<s> france was our next subject and one which seemed very near his heart <\s>
<s> he had been much in that country at the out break of the revolution and afterwards during its wildest excesses <\s>
<s> at the time of the september massacres he was at orleans <\s>
<s> he said i wonder how i came to stay there so long and at a period so exciting <\s>
<s> he had known many of the abb√©s and other ecclesiastics and thought highly of them as a class they were earnest faithful men being unmarried he must say they were the better able to fulfil their sacred duties they were married to their flocks <\s>
<s> in the towns there seemed he admitted very little religion but in the country there had always been a great deal <\s>
<s> i should like to spend another month in france he said before i close my eyes <\s>

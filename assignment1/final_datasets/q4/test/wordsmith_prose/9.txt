<s> the oldest and most respectable name for a county representative is knight of the shire <\s>
<s> in the reign of queen anne it was enacted that every knight of the shire the eldest sons of peers and a few others excepted shall have a clear estate of freehold or copyhold to the value of ?? 600 per annum <\s>
<s> the same qualification continues to be required at this day and if the depreciation of money and other causes have injuriously affected the letter of the statute the spirit of it has not only been preserved in practice but carried still higher <\s>
<s> hence we scarcely scruple to take for granted that a county representative is a man of substantial landed property or stands in such known relation to a conspicuous estate that he has in it a valuable interest and that whoever be the possessor such estate may be looked upon as a pledge for his conduct <\s>
<s> the basis of the elective franchise being property the legal condition of eligibility to a seat in parliament is the same <\s>
<s> our ancestors were not blind to the moral considerations which if they did not suggest these ordinances established a confidence in their expediency <\s>

<s> to be a voter required a fixed property or a defined privilege to be voted for required more and the scale of demand rose with the responsibility incurred <\s>
<s> a knight of the shire must have double the estate required from a representative of a borough <\s>
<s> this is the old law and the course of things since has caused as was observed above that high office to devolve almost exclusively on persons of large estate or their near connections <\s>
<s> and why is it desirable that we should not deviate from this track <\s>
<s> if we wish for honesty we shall select men who not being subject to one of the strongest temptations to be otherwise than honest will incur heavier disgrace and meet with less indulgence if they disappoint us <\s>
<s> do we wish for sage conduct our choice will fall upon those who have the wisdom that lurks in circumstances to supply what may be deficient in their personal accomplishments <\s>

<s> when persons of large property are confided in we cannot plead want of opportunities for being acquainted with them <\s>
<s> men of large estates cannot but be men of wide concerns and thus it is that they become known in proportion <\s>
<s> extensive landed property entails upon the possessor many duties and places him in divers relations by which he undergoes a public trial <\s>
<s> is a man just in his dealings <\s>
<s> does he keep his promises <\s>
<s> does he pay his debts punctually <\s>
<s> has he a feeling for the poor <\s>
<s> is his family well governed <\s>
<s> is he a considerate landlord <\s>
<s> does he attend to his own affairs and are those of others which have fallen under his care diligently and judiciously managed <\s>
<s> answers to these questions where the subject of them has but an inconsiderable landed property can only be expected from a very narrow circle of neighbours but place him at the head of a large estate and knowledge of what he is in these particulars must spread to a distance and it will be further known how he has acted as a magistrate and in what manner he has fulfilled the duties of every important office which he may have been called to by virtue of his possessions <\s>
<s> such are the general principles of reason which govern law and justify practice in this weighty matter <\s>
<s> the decision is not to take place upon imagination or conjecture <\s>
<s> it is not to rest upon professions of the candidate or protestations of his friends <\s>
<s> as a county representative is to be voted for by many many must have opportunities of knowing him or failing that intimate knowledge we require the pledge of condition the bond and seal of circumstance <\s>
<s> otherwise we withhold our confidence and cannot be prevailed upon to give to the opinions of an individual unbacked by these advantages the countenance and authority which they might derive from being supposed to accord with those of numerous constituents scattered over a wide country and therefore less liable to be affected by partial views or sudden and transitory passion to diminish their value <\s>
<s> the freeholders of past times knew that their rights were most likely to repose in safety under the shade of rank and property <\s>
<s> adventurers had no estimation among them there was no room for them no place for them to appear in think of this and ask if your fathers could they rise from their tombs would not have stared with no small degree of wonder upon the person who now solicits the suffrages of the county of westmoreland <\s>

<s> at all events it might be some satisfaction would they shew themselves so that if we are to have a subscription candidate we may know what sort of persons he is indebted to and at least be able to guess what they will require of him <\s>
<s> the principles that have been laid down and the facts which have been adverted to might seem to render it superfluous to retrace the public conduct of mr <\s>
<s> brougham and to enquire whether in parliament or at the london tavern in palace yard or elsewhere those acts and courses to which he himself refers as his only recommendation do not still more unfit him for the trust which he covets <\s>
<s> but persons fond of novelty make light of deficiencies which would have admitted of no compensation in the judgment of our ancestors and the candidate being in no respect remarkable for deference to public opinion is willing to avail himself of new fangled expectations <\s>
<s> hence it becomes necessary to consider what would be the political value of the freeholds of westmoreland if the system of annual parliaments and universal suffrage countenanced by mr <\s>
<s> brougham should be acted upon <\s>
<s> but as there has been much saying and unsaying on this subject let us review the case <\s>
<s> in the house of commons on the 17th of february 1817 lord cochrane affirmed that on a certain day which he named mr <\s>
<s> brougham at a dinner given at the london tavern to the friends of parliamentary reform used the following words or words to the same effect as often as we have required that parliaments should be chosen yearly and that the elective franchise should be extended to all who pay taxes we have been desired to wait for the enemy was at the gate and ready to avail himself of the discords attending our political contests in order to undermine our national independence <\s>
<s> this argument is gone and our adversaries must now look for another <\s>
<s> he had mentioned the two radical doctrines of yearly election and the franchise enjoyed by all paying taxes but it would be superfluous to reason in favour of them here where all are agreed on the subject <\s>

<s> directions and information for the tourist <\s>
<s> in preparing this manual it was the author's principal wish to furnish a guide or companion for the minds of persons of taste and feeling for landscape who might be inclined to explore the district of the lakes with that degree of attention to which its beauty may fairly lay claim <\s>
<s> for the more sure attainment however of this primary object he will begin by undertaking the humble and tedious task of supplying the tourist with directions how to approach the several scenes in their best or most convenient order <\s>
<s> but first supposing the approach to be made from the south and through yorkshire there are certain interesting spots which may be confidently recommended to his notice if time can be spared before entering upon the lake district and the route may be changed in returning <\s>
<s> there are three approaches to the lakes through yorkshire the least adviseable is the great north road by catterick and greta bridge and onwards to penrith <\s>
<s> the traveller however taking this route might halt at greta bridge and be well recompenced if he can afford to give an hour or two to the banks of the greta and of the tees at rokeby <\s>
<s> barnard castle also about two miles up the tees is a striking object and the main north road might be rejoined at bowes <\s>
<s> every one has heard of the great fall of the tees above middleham interesting for its grandeur as the avenue of rocks that leads to it is to the geologist <\s>
<s> but this place lies so far out of the way as scarcely to be within the compass of our notice <\s>
<s> it might however be visited by a traveller on foot or on horseback who could rejoin the main road upon stanemoor <\s>
<s> the second road leads through a more interesting tract of country beginning at ripon from which place see fountain's abbey and thence by hackfall and masham to jervaux abbey and up the vale of wensley turning aside before askrigg is reached to see aysgarth force upon the ure and again near hawes to hardraw scar of which with its waterfall turner has a fine drawing <\s>
<s> thence over the fells to sedbergh and kendal <\s>
<s> the third approach from yorkshire is through leeds <\s>
<s> four miles beyond that town are the ruins of kirkstall abbey should that road to skipton be chosen but the other by otley may be made much more interesting by turning off at addington to bolton bridge for the sake of visiting the abbey and grounds <\s>
<s> it would be well however for a party previously to secure beds if wanted at the inn as there is but one and it is much resorted to in summer <\s>
<s> the traveller on foot or horseback would do well to follow the banks of the wharf upwards to burnsall and thence cross over the hills to gordale a noble scene beautifully described in gray's tour and with which no one can be disappointed <\s>
<s> thence to malham where there is a respectable village inn and so on by malham cove to settle <\s>
<s> travellers in carriages must go from bolton bridge to skipton where they rejoin the main road and should they be inclined to visit gordale a tolerable road turns off beyond skipton <\s>
<s> beyond settle under giggleswick scar the road passes an ebbing and flowing well worthy the notice of the naturalist <\s>
<s> four miles to the right of ingleton is weathercote cave a fine object but whoever diverges for this must return to ingleton <\s>
<s> near kirkby lonsdale observe the view from the bridge over the lune and descend to the channel of the river and by no means omit looking at the vale of lune from the church yard <\s>
<s> the journey towards the lake country through lancashire is with the exception of the vale of the ribble at preston uninteresting till you come near lancaster and obtain a view of the fells and mountains of lancashire and westmoreland with lancaster castle and the tower of the church seeming to make part of the castle in the foreground <\s>
<s> they who wish to see the celebrated ruins of furness abbey and are not afraid of crossing the sands may go from lancaster to ulverston from which place take the direct road to dalton but by all means return through urswick for the sake of the view from the top of the hill before descending into the grounds of conishead priory <\s>
<s> from this quarter the lakes would be advantageously approached by coniston thence to hawkshead and by the ferry over windermere to bowness a much better introduction than by going direct from coniston to ambleside which ought not to be done as that would greatly take off from the effect of windermere <\s>
<s> let us now go back to lancaster <\s>
<s> the direct road thence to kendal is 22 miles but by making a circuit of eight miles the vale of the lune to kirkby lonsdale will be included <\s>
<s> the whole tract is pleasing there is one view mentioned by gray and mason especially so <\s>
<s> in west's guide it is thus pointed out about a quarter of a mile beyond the third mile stone where the road makes a turn to the right there is a gate on the left which leads into a field where the station meant will be found <\s>
<s> thus far for those who approach the lakes from the south <\s>
<s> travellers from the north would do well to go from carlisle by wigton and proceed along the lake of bassenthwaite to keswick or if convenience should take them first to penrith it would still be better to cross the country to keswick and begin with that vale rather than with ulswater <\s>
<s> it is worth while to mention in this place that the banks of the river eden about corby are well worthy of notice both on account of their natural beauty and the viaducts which have recently been carried over the bed of the river and over a neighbouring ravine <\s>
<s> in the church of wetherby close by is a fine piece of monumental sculpture by nollekens <\s>
<s> the scenes of nunnery upon the eden or rather that part of them which is upon croglin a mountain stream there falling into the eden are in their way unrivalled <\s>
<s> but the nearest road thither from corby is so bad that no one can be advised to take it in a carriage <\s>
<s> nunnery may be reached from corby by making a circuit and crossing the eden at armathwaite bridge <\s>
<s> a portion of this road however is bad enough <\s>
<s> as much the greatest number of lake tourists begin by passing from kendal to bowness upon windermere our notices shall commence with that lake <\s>
<s> bowness is situated upon its eastern side and at equal distance from each extremity of the lake of windermere <\s>
<s> the lower part of this lake is rarely visited but has many interesting points of view especially at storr's hall and at fellfoot where the coniston mountains peer nobly over the western barrier which elsewhere along the whole lake is comparatively tame <\s>
<s> to one also who has ascended the hill from grathwaite on the western side the promontory called rawlinson's nab storr's hall and the troutbeck mountains about sun set make a splendid landscape <\s>
<s> the view from the pleasure house of the station near the ferry has suffered much from larch plantations this mischief however is gradually disappearing and the larches under the management of the proprietor mr <\s>
<s> curwen are giving way to the native wood <\s>
<s> windermere ought to be seen both from its shores and from its surface <\s>
<s> none of the other lakes unfold so many fresh beauties to him who sails upon them <\s>
<s> this is owing to its greater size to the islands and to its having two vales at the head with their accompanying mountains of nearly equal dignity <\s>
<s> nor can the grandeur of these two terminations be seen at once from any point except from the bosom of the lake <\s>
<s> the islands may be explored at any time of the day but one bright unruffled evening must if possible be set apart for the splendour the stillness and solemnity of a three hours voyage upon the higher division of the lake not omitting towards the end of the excursion to quit the expanse of water and peep into the close and calm river at the head which in its quiet character at such a time appears rather like an overflow of the peaceful lake itself than to have any more immediate connection with the rough mountains whence it has descended or the turbulent torrents by which it is supplied <\s>
<s> many persons content themselves with what they see of windermere during their progress in a boat from bowness to the head of the lake walking thence to ambleside <\s>
<s> but the whole road from bowness is rich in diversity of pleasing or grand scenery there is scarcely a field on the road side which if entered would not give to the landscape some additional charm <\s>
<s> low wood inn a mile from the head of windermere is a most pleasant halting place no inn in the whole district is so agreeably situated for water views and excursions and the fields above it and the lane that leads to troutbeck present beautiful views towards each extremity of the lake <\s>
<s> from this place and from ambleside rides may be taken in numerous directions and the interesting walks are inexhaustible 47 ]; a few out of the main road may be particularized the lane that leads from ambleside to skelgill the ride or walk by rothay bridge and up the stream under loughrigg fell continued on the western side of rydal lake and along the fell to the foot of grasmere lake and thence round by the church of grasmere or turning round loughrigg fell by loughrigg tarn and the river brathay back to ambleside <\s>
<s> from ambleside is another charming excursion by clappersgate where cross the brathay and proceed with the river on the right to the hamlet of skelwith fold when the houses are passed turn before you descend the hill through a gate on the right and from a rocky point is a fine view of the brathay river langdale pikes c then proceed to colwith force and up little langdale to blea tarn <\s>
<s> the scene in which this small piece of water lies suggested to the author the following description given in his poem of the excursion supposing the spectator to look down upon it not from the road but from one of its elevated sides <\s>
<s> beneath our feet a little lowly vale a lowly vale and yet uplifted high among the mountains even as if the spot had been from eldest time by wish of theirs so placed to be shut out from all the world <\s>
<s> urn like it was in shape deep as an urn with rocks encompassed save that to the south was one small opening where a heath clad ridge supplied a boundary less abrupt and close a quiet treeless nook 48 with two green fields a liquid pool that glittered in the sun and one bare dwelling one abode no more <\s>
<s> it seemed the home of poverty and toil though not of want the little fields made green by husbandry of many thrifty years paid cheerful tribute to the moorland house <\s>
<s> there crows the cock single in his domain the small birds find in spring no thicket there to shroud them only from the neighbouring vales the cuckoo straggling up to the hill tops shouteth faint tidings of some gladder place <\s>
<s> green's guide to the lakes in two vols contains a complete magazine of minute and accurate information of this kind with the names of mountains streams c <\s>
<s> 48 no longer strictly applicable on account of recent plantations <\s>
<s> from this little vale return towards ambleside by great langdale stopping if there be time to see dungeon ghyll waterfall <\s>
<s> the lake of coniston may be conveniently visited from ambleside but is seen to most advantage by entering the country over the sands from lancaster <\s>
<s> the stranger from the moment he sets his foot on those sands seems to leave the turmoil and traffic of the world behind him and crossing the majestic plain whence the sea has retired he beholds rising apparently from its base the cluster of mountains among which he is going to wander and towards whose recesses by the vale of coniston he is gradually and peacefully led <\s>
<s> from the inn at the head of coniston lake a leisurely traveller might have much pleasure in looking into yewdale and tilberthwaite returning to his inn from the head of yewdale by a mountain track which has the farm of tarn hows a little on the right by this road is seen much the best view of coniston lake from the south <\s>
<s> at the head of coniston water there is an agreeable inn from which an enterprising tourist might go to the vale of the duddon over walna scar down to seathwaite newfield and to the rocks where the river issues from a narrow pass into the broad vale <\s>
<s> the stream is very interesting for the space of a mile above this point and below by ulpha kirk till it enters the sands where it is overlooked by the solitary mountain black comb the summit of which as that experienced surveyor colonel mudge declared commands a more extensive view than any point in britain <\s>

<s> directions and information for the tourist <\s>
<s> in preparing this manual it was the author's principal wish to furnish a guide or companion for the minds of persons of taste and feeling for landscape who might be inclined to explore the district of the lakes with that degree of attention to which its beauty may fairly lay claim <\s>
<s> for the more sure attainment however of this primary object he will begin by undertaking the humble and tedious task of supplying the tourist with directions how to approach the several scenes in their best or most convenient order <\s>
<s> but first supposing the approach to be made from the south and through yorkshire there are certain interesting spots which may be confidently recommended to his notice if time can be spared before entering upon the lake district and the route may be changed in returning <\s>
<s> there are three approaches to the lakes through yorkshire the least adviseable is the great north road by catterick and greta bridge and onwards to penrith <\s>
<s> the traveller however taking this route might halt at greta bridge and be well recompenced if he can afford to give an hour or two to the banks of the greta and of the tees at rokeby <\s>
<s> barnard castle also about two miles up the tees is a striking object and the main north road might be rejoined at bowes <\s>
<s> every one has heard of the great fall of the tees above middleham interesting for its grandeur as the avenue of rocks that leads to it is to the geologist <\s>
<s> but this place lies so far out of the way as scarcely to be within the compass of our notice <\s>
<s> it might however be visited by a traveller on foot or on horseback who could rejoin the main road upon stanemoor <\s>
<s> the second road leads through a more interesting tract of country beginning at ripon from which place see fountain's abbey and thence by hackfall and masham to jervaux abbey and up the vale of wensley turning aside before askrigg is reached to see aysgarth force upon the ure and again near hawes to hardraw scar of which with its waterfall turner has a fine drawing <\s>
<s> thence over the fells to sedbergh and kendal <\s>
<s> the third approach from yorkshire is through leeds <\s>
<s> four miles beyond that town are the ruins of kirkstall abbey should that road to skipton be chosen but the other by otley may be made much more interesting by turning off at addington to bolton bridge for the sake of visiting the abbey and grounds <\s>
<s> it would be well however for a party previously to secure beds if wanted at the inn as there is but one and it is much resorted to in summer <\s>
<s> the traveller on foot or horseback would do well to follow the banks of the wharf upwards to burnsall and thence cross over the hills to gordale a noble scene beautifully described in gray's tour and with which no one can be disappointed <\s>
<s> thence to malham where there is a respectable village inn and so on by malham cove to settle <\s>
<s> travellers in carriages must go from bolton bridge to skipton where they rejoin the main road and should they be inclined to visit gordale a tolerable road turns off beyond skipton <\s>
<s> beyond settle under giggleswick scar the road passes an ebbing and flowing well worthy the notice of the naturalist <\s>
<s> four miles to the right of ingleton is weathercote cave a fine object but whoever diverges for this must return to ingleton <\s>
<s> near kirkby lonsdale observe the view from the bridge over the lune and descend to the channel of the river and by no means omit looking at the vale of lune from the church yard <\s>
<s> the journey towards the lake country through lancashire is with the exception of the vale of the ribble at preston uninteresting till you come near lancaster and obtain a view of the fells and mountains of lancashire and westmoreland with lancaster castle and the tower of the church seeming to make part of the castle in the foreground <\s>
<s> they who wish to see the celebrated ruins of furness abbey and are not afraid of crossing the sands may go from lancaster to ulverston from which place take the direct road to dalton but by all means return through urswick for the sake of the view from the top of the hill before descending into the grounds of conishead priory <\s>
<s> from this quarter the lakes would be advantageously approached by coniston thence to hawkshead and by the ferry over windermere to bowness a much better introduction than by going direct from coniston to ambleside which ought not to be done as that would greatly take off from the effect of windermere <\s>
<s> let us now go back to lancaster <\s>
<s> the direct road thence to kendal is 22 miles but by making a circuit of eight miles the vale of the lune to kirkby lonsdale will be included <\s>
<s> the whole tract is pleasing there is one view mentioned by gray and mason especially so <\s>
<s> in west's guide it is thus pointed out about a quarter of a mile beyond the third mile stone where the road makes a turn to the right there is a gate on the left which leads into a field where the station meant will be found <\s>
<s> thus far for those who approach the lakes from the south <\s>
<s> travellers from the north would do well to go from carlisle by wigton and proceed along the lake of bassenthwaite to keswick or if convenience should take them first to penrith it would still be better to cross the country to keswick and begin with that vale rather than with ulswater <\s>
<s> it is worth while to mention in this place that the banks of the river eden about corby are well worthy of notice both on account of their natural beauty and the viaducts which have recently been carried over the bed of the river and over a neighbouring ravine <\s>
<s> in the church of wetherby close by is a fine piece of monumental sculpture by nollekens <\s>
<s> the scenes of nunnery upon the eden or rather that part of them which is upon croglin a mountain stream there falling into the eden are in their way unrivalled <\s>
<s> but the nearest road thither from corby is so bad that no one can be advised to take it in a carriage <\s>
<s> nunnery may be reached from corby by making a circuit and crossing the eden at armathwaite bridge <\s>
<s> a portion of this road however is bad enough <\s>
<s> as much the greatest number of lake tourists begin by passing from kendal to bowness upon windermere our notices shall commence with that lake <\s>
<s> bowness is situated upon its eastern side and at equal distance from each extremity of the lake of windermere <\s>
<s> the lower part of this lake is rarely visited but has many interesting points of view especially at storr's hall and at fellfoot where the coniston mountains peer nobly over the western barrier which elsewhere along the whole lake is comparatively tame <\s>
<s> to one also who has ascended the hill from grathwaite on the western side the promontory called rawlinson's nab storr's hall and the troutbeck mountains about sun set make a splendid landscape <\s>
<s> the view from the pleasure house of the station near the ferry has suffered much from larch plantations this mischief however is gradually disappearing and the larches under the management of the proprietor mr <\s>
<s> curwen are giving way to the native wood <\s>
<s> windermere ought to be seen both from its shores and from its surface <\s>
<s> none of the other lakes unfold so many fresh beauties to him who sails upon them <\s>
<s> this is owing to its greater size to the islands and to its having two vales at the head with their accompanying mountains of nearly equal dignity <\s>
<s> nor can the grandeur of these two terminations be seen at once from any point except from the bosom of the lake <\s>
<s> the islands may be explored at any time of the day but one bright unruffled evening must if possible be set apart for the splendour the stillness and solemnity of a three hours voyage upon the higher division of the lake not omitting towards the end of the excursion to quit the expanse of water and peep into the close and calm river at the head which in its quiet character at such a time appears rather like an overflow of the peaceful lake itself than to have any more immediate connection with the rough mountains whence it has descended or the turbulent torrents by which it is supplied <\s>
<s> many persons content themselves with what they see of windermere during their progress in a boat from bowness to the head of the lake walking thence to ambleside <\s>
<s> but the whole road from bowness is rich in diversity of pleasing or grand scenery there is scarcely a field on the road side which if entered would not give to the landscape some additional charm <\s>
<s> low wood inn a mile from the head of windermere is a most pleasant halting place no inn in the whole district is so agreeably situated for water views and excursions and the fields above it and the lane that leads to troutbeck present beautiful views towards each extremity of the lake <\s>
<s> from this place and from ambleside rides may be taken in numerous directions and the interesting walks are inexhaustible 47 ]; a few out of the main road may be particularized the lane that leads from ambleside to skelgill the ride or walk by rothay bridge and up the stream under loughrigg fell continued on the western side of rydal lake and along the fell to the foot of grasmere lake and thence round by the church of grasmere or turning round loughrigg fell by loughrigg tarn and the river brathay back to ambleside <\s>
<s> from ambleside is another charming excursion by clappersgate where cross the brathay and proceed with the river on the right to the hamlet of skelwith fold when the houses are passed turn before you descend the hill through a gate on the right and from a rocky point is a fine view of the brathay river langdale pikes c then proceed to colwith force and up little langdale to blea tarn <\s>
<s> the scene in which this small piece of water lies suggested to the author the following description given in his poem of the excursion supposing the spectator to look down upon it not from the road but from one of its elevated sides <\s>
<s> beneath our feet a little lowly vale a lowly vale and yet uplifted high among the mountains even as if the spot had been from eldest time by wish of theirs so placed to be shut out from all the world <\s>
<s> urn like it was in shape deep as an urn with rocks encompassed save that to the south was one small opening where a heath clad ridge supplied a boundary less abrupt and close a quiet treeless nook 48 with two green fields a liquid pool that glittered in the sun and one bare dwelling one abode no more <\s>
<s> it seemed the home of poverty and toil though not of want the little fields made green by husbandry of many thrifty years paid cheerful tribute to the moorland house <\s>
<s> there crows the cock single in his domain the small birds find in spring no thicket there to shroud them only from the neighbouring vales the cuckoo straggling up to the hill tops shouteth faint tidings of some gladder place <\s>
<s> green's guide to the lakes in two vols contains a complete magazine of minute and accurate information of this kind with the names of mountains streams c <\s>
<s> 48 no longer strictly applicable on account of recent plantations <\s>
<s> from this little vale return towards ambleside by great langdale stopping if there be time to see dungeon ghyll waterfall <\s>
<s> the lake of coniston may be conveniently visited from ambleside but is seen to most advantage by entering the country over the sands from lancaster <\s>
<s> the stranger from the moment he sets his foot on those sands seems to leave the turmoil and traffic of the world behind him and crossing the majestic plain whence the sea has retired he beholds rising apparently from its base the cluster of mountains among which he is going to wander and towards whose recesses by the vale of coniston he is gradually and peacefully led <\s>
<s> from the inn at the head of coniston lake a leisurely traveller might have much pleasure in looking into yewdale and tilberthwaite returning to his inn from the head of yewdale by a mountain track which has the farm of tarn hows a little on the right by this road is seen much the best view of coniston lake from the south <\s>
<s> at the head of coniston water there is an agreeable inn from which an enterprising tourist might go to the vale of the duddon over walna scar down to seathwaite newfield and to the rocks where the river issues from a narrow pass into the broad vale <\s>
<s> the stream is very interesting for the space of a mile above this point and below by ulpha kirk till it enters the sands where it is overlooked by the solitary mountain black comb the summit of which as that experienced surveyor colonel mudge declared commands a more extensive view than any point in britain <\s>
<s> ireland he saw more than once but not when the sun was above the horizon <\s>
<s> close by the sea lone sentinel black comb his forward station keeps he breaks the sea's tumultuous swell and ponders o'er the level deeps <\s>
<s> the boy whom i had in my mind was by no means disgusting in his appearance quite the contrary and i have known several with imperfect faculties who are handsome in their persons and features <\s>
<s> there is one at present within a mile of my own house remarkably so though he has something of a stare and vacancy in his countenance <\s>
<s> a friend of mine knowing that some persons had a dislike to the poem such as you have expressed advised me to add a stanza describing the person of the boy so as entirely to separate him in the imaginations of my readers from that class of idiots who are disgusting in their persons but the narration in the poem is so rapid and impassioned that i could not find a place in which to insert the stanza without checking the progress of it and so leaving a deadness upon the feeling <\s>
<s> this poem has i know frequently produced the same effect as it did upon you and your friends but there are many also to whom it affords exquisite delight and who indeed prefer it to any other of my poems <\s>

<s> directions and information for the tourist <\s>
<s> in preparing this manual it was the author's principal wish to furnish a guide or companion for the minds of persons of taste and feeling for landscape who might be inclined to explore the district of the lakes with that degree of attention to which its beauty may fairly lay claim <\s>
<s> for the more sure attainment however of this primary object he will begin by undertaking the humble and tedious task of supplying the tourist with directions how to approach the several scenes in their best or most convenient order <\s>
<s> but first supposing the approach to be made from the south and through yorkshire there are certain interesting spots which may be confidently recommended to his notice if time can be spared before entering upon the lake district and the route may be changed in returning <\s>
<s> there are three approaches to the lakes through yorkshire the least adviseable is the great north road by catterick and greta bridge and onwards to penrith <\s>
<s> the traveller however taking this route might halt at greta bridge and be well recompenced if he can afford to give an hour or two to the banks of the greta and of the tees at rokeby <\s>
<s> barnard castle also about two miles up the tees is a striking object and the main north road might be rejoined at bowes <\s>
<s> every one has heard of the great fall of the tees above middleham interesting for its grandeur as the avenue of rocks that leads to it is to the geologist <\s>
<s> but this place lies so far out of the way as scarcely to be within the compass of our notice <\s>
<s> it might however be visited by a traveller on foot or on horseback who could rejoin the main road upon stanemoor <\s>
<s> the second road leads through a more interesting tract of country beginning at ripon from which place see fountain's abbey and thence by hackfall and masham to jervaux abbey and up the vale of wensley turning aside before askrigg is reached to see aysgarth force upon the ure and again near hawes to hardraw scar of which with its waterfall turner has a fine drawing <\s>
<s> thence over the fells to sedbergh and kendal <\s>
<s> the third approach from yorkshire is through leeds <\s>
<s> four miles beyond that town are the ruins of kirkstall abbey should that road to skipton be chosen but the other by otley may be made much more interesting by turning off at addington to bolton bridge for the sake of visiting the abbey and grounds <\s>
<s> it would be well however for a party previously to secure beds if wanted at the inn as there is but one and it is much resorted to in summer <\s>
<s> the traveller on foot or horseback would do well to follow the banks of the wharf upwards to burnsall and thence cross over the hills to gordale a noble scene beautifully described in gray's tour and with which no one can be disappointed <\s>
<s> thence to malham where there is a respectable village inn and so on by malham cove to settle <\s>
<s> travellers in carriages must go from bolton bridge to skipton where they rejoin the main road and should they be inclined to visit gordale a tolerable road turns off beyond skipton <\s>
<s> beyond settle under giggleswick scar the road passes an ebbing and flowing well worthy the notice of the naturalist <\s>
<s> four miles to the right of ingleton is weathercote cave a fine object but whoever diverges for this must return to ingleton <\s>
<s> near kirkby lonsdale observe the view from the bridge over the lune and descend to the channel of the river and by no means omit looking at the vale of lune from the church yard <\s>
<s> the journey towards the lake country through lancashire is with the exception of the vale of the ribble at preston uninteresting till you come near lancaster and obtain a view of the fells and mountains of lancashire and westmoreland with lancaster castle and the tower of the church seeming to make part of the castle in the foreground <\s>
<s> they who wish to see the celebrated ruins of furness abbey and are not afraid of crossing the sands may go from lancaster to ulverston from which place take the direct road to dalton but by all means return through urswick for the sake of the view from the top of the hill before descending into the grounds of conishead priory <\s>
<s> from this quarter the lakes would be advantageously approached by coniston thence to hawkshead and by the ferry over windermere to bowness a much better introduction than by going direct from coniston to ambleside which ought not to be done as that would greatly take off from the effect of windermere <\s>
<s> let us now go back to lancaster <\s>
<s> the direct road thence to kendal is 22 miles but by making a circuit of eight miles the vale of the lune to kirkby lonsdale will be included <\s>
<s> the whole tract is pleasing there is one view mentioned by gray and mason especially so <\s>
<s> in west's guide it is thus pointed out about a quarter of a mile beyond the third mile stone where the road makes a turn to the right there is a gate on the left which leads into a field where the station meant will be found <\s>
<s> thus far for those who approach the lakes from the south <\s>
<s> travellers from the north would do well to go from carlisle by wigton and proceed along the lake of bassenthwaite to keswick or if convenience should take them first to penrith it would still be better to cross the country to keswick and begin with that vale rather than with ulswater <\s>
<s> it is worth while to mention in this place that the banks of the river eden about corby are well worthy of notice both on account of their natural beauty and the viaducts which have recently been carried over the bed of the river and over a neighbouring ravine <\s>
<s> in the church of wetherby close by is a fine piece of monumental sculpture by nollekens <\s>
<s> the scenes of nunnery upon the eden or rather that part of them which is upon croglin a mountain stream there falling into the eden are in their way unrivalled <\s>
<s> but the nearest road thither from corby is so bad that no one can be advised to take it in a carriage <\s>
<s> nunnery may be reached from corby by making a circuit and crossing the eden at armathwaite bridge <\s>
<s> a portion of this road however is bad enough <\s>
<s> as much the greatest number of lake tourists begin by passing from kendal to bowness upon windermere our notices shall commence with that lake <\s>
<s> bowness is situated upon its eastern side and at equal distance from each extremity of the lake of windermere <\s>
<s> the lower part of this lake is rarely visited but has many interesting points of view especially at storr's hall and at fellfoot where the coniston mountains peer nobly over the western barrier which elsewhere along the whole lake is comparatively tame <\s>
<s> to one also who has ascended the hill from grathwaite on the western side the promontory called rawlinson's nab storr's hall and the troutbeck mountains about sun set make a splendid landscape <\s>
<s> the view from the pleasure house of the station near the ferry has suffered much from larch plantations this mischief however is gradually disappearing and the larches under the management of the proprietor mr <\s>
<s> curwen are giving way to the native wood <\s>
<s> windermere ought to be seen both from its shores and from its surface <\s>
<s> none of the other lakes unfold so many fresh beauties to him who sails upon them <\s>
<s> this is owing to its greater size to the islands and to its having two vales at the head with their accompanying mountains of nearly equal dignity <\s>
<s> nor can the grandeur of these two terminations be seen at once from any point except from the bosom of the lake <\s>
<s> the islands may be explored at any time of the day but one bright unruffled evening must if possible be set apart for the splendour the stillness and solemnity of a three hours voyage upon the higher division of the lake not omitting towards the end of the excursion to quit the expanse of water and peep into the close and calm river at the head which in its quiet character at such a time appears rather like an overflow of the peaceful lake itself than to have any more immediate connection with the rough mountains whence it has descended or the turbulent torrents by which it is supplied <\s>
<s> many persons content themselves with what they see of windermere during their progress in a boat from bowness to the head of the lake walking thence to ambleside <\s>
<s> but the whole road from bowness is rich in diversity of pleasing or grand scenery there is scarcely a field on the road side which if entered would not give to the landscape some additional charm <\s>
<s> low wood inn a mile from the head of windermere is a most pleasant halting place no inn in the whole district is so agreeably situated for water views and excursions and the fields above it and the lane that leads to troutbeck present beautiful views towards each extremity of the lake <\s>
<s> from this place and from ambleside rides may be taken in numerous directions and the interesting walks are inexhaustible 47 ]; a few out of the main road may be particularized the lane that leads from ambleside to skelgill the ride or walk by rothay bridge and up the stream under loughrigg fell continued on the western side of rydal lake and along the fell to the foot of grasmere lake and thence round by the church of grasmere or turning round loughrigg fell by loughrigg tarn and the river brathay back to ambleside <\s>
<s> from ambleside is another charming excursion by clappersgate where cross the brathay and proceed with the river on the right to the hamlet of skelwith fold when the houses are passed turn before you descend the hill through a gate on the right and from a rocky point is a fine view of the brathay river langdale pikes c then proceed to colwith force and up little langdale to blea tarn <\s>
<s> the scene in which this small piece of water lies suggested to the author the following description given in his poem of the excursion supposing the spectator to look down upon it not from the road but from one of its elevated sides <\s>
<s> beneath our feet a little lowly vale a lowly vale and yet uplifted high among the mountains even as if the spot had been from eldest time by wish of theirs so placed to be shut out from all the world <\s>
<s> urn like it was in shape deep as an urn with rocks encompassed save that to the south was one small opening where a heath clad ridge supplied a boundary less abrupt and close a quiet treeless nook 48 with two green fields a liquid pool that glittered in the sun and one bare dwelling one abode no more <\s>
<s> it seemed the home of poverty and toil though not of want the little fields made green by husbandry of many thrifty years paid cheerful tribute to the moorland house <\s>
<s> there crows the cock single in his domain the small birds find in spring no thicket there to shroud them only from the neighbouring vales the cuckoo straggling up to the hill tops shouteth faint tidings of some gladder place <\s>
<s> green's guide to the lakes in two vols contains a complete magazine of minute and accurate information of this kind with the names of mountains streams c <\s>
<s> 48 no longer strictly applicable on account of recent plantations <\s>
<s> from this little vale return towards ambleside by great langdale stopping if there be time to see dungeon ghyll waterfall <\s>
<s> the lake of coniston may be conveniently visited from ambleside but is seen to most advantage by entering the country over the sands from lancaster <\s>
<s> the stranger from the moment he sets his foot on those sands seems to leave the turmoil and traffic of the world behind him and crossing the majestic plain whence the sea has retired he beholds rising apparently from its base the cluster of mountains among which he is going to wander and towards whose recesses by the vale of coniston he is gradually and peacefully led <\s>
<s> from the inn at the head of coniston lake a leisurely traveller might have much pleasure in looking into yewdale and tilberthwaite returning to his inn from the head of yewdale by a mountain track which has the farm of tarn hows a little on the right by this road is seen much the best view of coniston lake from the south <\s>
<s> at the head of coniston water there is an agreeable inn from which an enterprising tourist might go to the vale of the duddon over walna scar down to seathwaite newfield and to the rocks where the river issues from a narrow pass into the broad vale <\s>
<s> the stream is very interesting for the space of a mile above this point and below by ulpha kirk till it enters the sands where it is overlooked by the solitary mountain black comb the summit of which as that experienced surveyor colonel mudge declared commands a more extensive view than any point in britain <\s>
<s> ireland he saw more than once but not when the sun was above the horizon <\s>
<s> close by the sea lone sentinel black comb his forward station keeps he breaks the sea's tumultuous swell and ponders o'er the level deeps <\s>
<s> the boy whom i had in my mind was by no means disgusting in his appearance quite the contrary and i have known several with imperfect faculties who are handsome in their persons and features <\s>
<s> there is one at present within a mile of my own house remarkably so though he has something of a stare and vacancy in his countenance <\s>
<s> a friend of mine knowing that some persons had a dislike to the poem such as you have expressed advised me to add a stanza describing the person of the boy so as entirely to separate him in the imaginations of my readers from that class of idiots who are disgusting in their persons but the narration in the poem is so rapid and impassioned that i could not find a place in which to insert the stanza without checking the progress of it and so leaving a deadness upon the feeling <\s>
<s> this poem has i know frequently produced the same effect as it did upon you and your friends but there are many also to whom it affords exquisite delight and who indeed prefer it to any other of my poems <\s>
<s> this proves that the feelings there delineated are such as men may sympathise with <\s>
<s> this is enough for my purpose <\s>
<s> it is not enough for me as a poet to delineate merely such feelings as all men do sympathise with but it is also highly desirable to add to these others such as all men may sympathise with and such as there is reason to believe they would be better and more moral beings if they did sympathise with <\s>
<s> i conclude with regret because i have not said one half of what i intended to say but i am sure you will deem my excuse sufficient when i inform you that my head aches violently and i am in other respects unwell <\s>
<s> i must however again give you my warmest thanks for your kind letter <\s>
<s> i shall be happy to hear from you again and do not think it unreasonable that i should request a letter from you when i feel that the answer which i may make to it will not perhaps be above three or four lines <\s>
<s> this i mention to you with frankness and you will not take it ill after what i have before said of my remissness in writing letters <\s>

<s> in preparing this manual it was the author's principal wish to furnish a guide or companion for the minds of persons of taste and feeling for landscape who might be inclined to explore the district of the lakes with that degree of attention to which its beauty may fairly lay claim <\s>
<s> for the more sure attainment however of this primary object he will begin by undertaking the humble and tedious task of supplying the tourist with directions how to approach the several scenes in their best or most convenient order <\s>
<s> but first supposing the approach to be made from the south and through yorkshire there are certain interesting spots which may be confidently recommended to his notice if time can be spared before entering upon the lake district and the route may be changed in returning <\s>
<s> there are three approaches to the lakes through yorkshire the least adviseable is the great north road by catterick and greta bridge and onwards to penrith <\s>
<s> the traveller however taking this route might halt at greta bridge and be well recompenced if he can afford to give an hour or two to the banks of the greta and of the tees at rokeby <\s>
<s> barnard castle also about two miles up the tees is a striking object and the main north road might be rejoined at bowes <\s>
<s> every one has heard of the great fall of the tees above middleham interesting for its grandeur as the avenue of rocks that leads to it is to the geologist <\s>
<s> but this place lies so far out of the way as scarcely to be within the compass of our notice <\s>
<s> it might however be visited by a traveller on foot or on horseback who could rejoin the main road upon stanemoor <\s>
<s> the second road leads through a more interesting tract of country beginning at ripon from which place see fountain's abbey and thence by hackfall and masham to jervaux abbey and up the vale of wensley turning aside before askrigg is reached to see aysgarth force upon the ure and again near hawes to hardraw scar of which with its waterfall turner has a fine drawing <\s>
<s> thence over the fells to sedbergh and kendal <\s>
<s> the third approach from yorkshire is through leeds <\s>
<s> four miles beyond that town are the ruins of kirkstall abbey should that road to skipton be chosen but the other by otley may be made much more interesting by turning off at addington to bolton bridge for the sake of visiting the abbey and grounds <\s>
<s> it would be well however for a party previously to secure beds if wanted at the inn as there is but one and it is much resorted to in summer <\s>
<s> the traveller on foot or horseback would do well to follow the banks of the wharf upwards to burnsall and thence cross over the hills to gordale a noble scene beautifully described in gray's tour and with which no one can be disappointed <\s>
<s> thence to malham where there is a respectable village inn and so on by malham cove to settle <\s>
<s> travellers in carriages must go from bolton bridge to skipton where they rejoin the main road and should they be inclined to visit gordale a tolerable road turns off beyond skipton <\s>
<s> beyond settle under giggleswick scar the road passes an ebbing and flowing well worthy the notice of the naturalist <\s>
<s> four miles to the right of ingleton is weathercote cave a fine object but whoever diverges for this must return to ingleton <\s>
<s> near kirkby lonsdale observe the view from the bridge over the lune and descend to the channel of the river and by no means omit looking at the vale of lune from the church yard <\s>
<s> the journey towards the lake country through lancashire is with the exception of the vale of the ribble at preston uninteresting till you come near lancaster and obtain a view of the fells and mountains of lancashire and westmoreland with lancaster castle and the tower of the church seeming to make part of the castle in the foreground <\s>
<s> they who wish to see the celebrated ruins of furness abbey and are not afraid of crossing the sands may go from lancaster to ulverston from which place take the direct road to dalton but by all means return through urswick for the sake of the view from the top of the hill before descending into the grounds of conishead priory <\s>
<s> from this quarter the lakes would be advantageously approached by coniston thence to hawkshead and by the ferry over windermere to bowness a much better introduction than by going direct from coniston to ambleside which ought not to be done as that would greatly take off from the effect of windermere <\s>
<s> let us now go back to lancaster <\s>
<s> the direct road thence to kendal is 22 miles but by making a circuit of eight miles the vale of the lune to kirkby lonsdale will be included <\s>
<s> the whole tract is pleasing there is one view mentioned by gray and mason especially so <\s>
<s> in west's guide it is thus pointed out about a quarter of a mile beyond the third mile stone where the road makes a turn to the right there is a gate on the left which leads into a field where the station meant will be found <\s>
<s> thus far for those who approach the lakes from the south <\s>
<s> travellers from the north would do well to go from carlisle by wigton and proceed along the lake of bassenthwaite to keswick or if convenience should take them first to penrith it would still be better to cross the country to keswick and begin with that vale rather than with ulswater <\s>
<s> it is worth while to mention in this place that the banks of the river eden about corby are well worthy of notice both on account of their natural beauty and the viaducts which have recently been carried over the bed of the river and over a neighbouring ravine <\s>
<s> in the church of wetherby close by is a fine piece of monumental sculpture by nollekens <\s>
<s> the scenes of nunnery upon the eden or rather that part of them which is upon croglin a mountain stream there falling into the eden are in their way unrivalled <\s>
<s> but the nearest road thither from corby is so bad that no one can be advised to take it in a carriage <\s>
<s> nunnery may be reached from corby by making a circuit and crossing the eden at armathwaite bridge <\s>
<s> a portion of this road however is bad enough <\s>
<s> as much the greatest number of lake tourists begin by passing from kendal to bowness upon windermere our notices shall commence with that lake <\s>
<s> bowness is situated upon its eastern side and at equal distance from each extremity of the lake of windermere <\s>
<s> the lower part of this lake is rarely visited but has many interesting points of view especially at storr's hall and at fellfoot where the coniston mountains peer nobly over the western barrier which elsewhere along the whole lake is comparatively tame <\s>
<s> to one also who has ascended the hill from grathwaite on the western side the promontory called rawlinson's nab storr's hall and the troutbeck mountains about sun set make a splendid landscape <\s>
<s> the view from the pleasure house of the station near the ferry has suffered much from larch plantations this mischief however is gradually disappearing and the larches under the management of the proprietor mr <\s>
<s> curwen are giving way to the native wood <\s>
<s> windermere ought to be seen both from its shores and from its surface <\s>
<s> none of the other lakes unfold so many fresh beauties to him who sails upon them <\s>
<s> this is owing to its greater size to the islands and to its having two vales at the head with their accompanying mountains of nearly equal dignity <\s>
<s> nor can the grandeur of these two terminations be seen at once from any point except from the bosom of the lake <\s>
<s> the islands may be explored at any time of the day but one bright unruffled evening must if possible be set apart for the splendour the stillness and solemnity of a three hours voyage upon the higher division of the lake not omitting towards the end of the excursion to quit the expanse of water and peep into the close and calm river at the head which in its quiet character at such a time appears rather like an overflow of the peaceful lake itself than to have any more immediate connection with the rough mountains whence it has descended or the turbulent torrents by which it is supplied <\s>
<s> many persons content themselves with what they see of windermere during their progress in a boat from bowness to the head of the lake walking thence to ambleside <\s>
<s> but the whole road from bowness is rich in diversity of pleasing or grand scenery there is scarcely a field on the road side which if entered would not give to the landscape some additional charm <\s>
<s> low wood inn a mile from the head of windermere is a most pleasant halting place no inn in the whole district is so agreeably situated for water views and excursions and the fields above it and the lane that leads to troutbeck present beautiful views towards each extremity of the lake <\s>
<s> from this place and from ambleside rides may be taken in numerous directions and the interesting walks are inexhaustible 47 ]; a few out of the main road may be particularized the lane that leads from ambleside to skelgill the ride or walk by rothay bridge and up the stream under loughrigg fell continued on the western side of rydal lake and along the fell to the foot of grasmere lake and thence round by the church of grasmere or turning round loughrigg fell by loughrigg tarn and the river brathay back to ambleside <\s>
<s> from ambleside is another charming excursion by clappersgate where cross the brathay and proceed with the river on the right to the hamlet of skelwith fold when the houses are passed turn before you descend the hill through a gate on the right and from a rocky point is a fine view of the brathay river langdale pikes c then proceed to colwith force and up little langdale to blea tarn <\s>
<s> the scene in which this small piece of water lies suggested to the author the following description given in his poem of the excursion supposing the spectator to look down upon it not from the road but from one of its elevated sides <\s>
<s> beneath our feet a little lowly vale a lowly vale and yet uplifted high among the mountains even as if the spot had been from eldest time by wish of theirs so placed to be shut out from all the world <\s>
<s> urn like it was in shape deep as an urn with rocks encompassed save that to the south was one small opening where a heath clad ridge supplied a boundary less abrupt and close a quiet treeless nook 48 with two green fields a liquid pool that glittered in the sun and one bare dwelling one abode no more <\s>
<s> it seemed the home of poverty and toil though not of want the little fields made green by husbandry of many thrifty years paid cheerful tribute to the moorland house <\s>
<s> there crows the cock single in his domain the small birds find in spring no thicket there to shroud them only from the neighbouring vales the cuckoo straggling up to the hill tops shouteth faint tidings of some gladder place <\s>
<s> green's guide to the lakes in two vols contains a complete magazine of minute and accurate information of this kind with the names of mountains streams c <\s>
<s> 48 no longer strictly applicable on account of recent plantations <\s>
<s> from this little vale return towards ambleside by great langdale stopping if there be time to see dungeon ghyll waterfall <\s>
<s> the lake of coniston may be conveniently visited from ambleside but is seen to most advantage by entering the country over the sands from lancaster <\s>
<s> the stranger from the moment he sets his foot on those sands seems to leave the turmoil and traffic of the world behind him and crossing the majestic plain whence the sea has retired he beholds rising apparently from its base the cluster of mountains among which he is going to wander and towards whose recesses by the vale of coniston he is gradually and peacefully led <\s>
<s> from the inn at the head of coniston lake a leisurely traveller might have much pleasure in looking into yewdale and tilberthwaite returning to his inn from the head of yewdale by a mountain track which has the farm of tarn hows a little on the right by this road is seen much the best view of coniston lake from the south <\s>
<s> at the head of coniston water there is an agreeable inn from which an enterprising tourist might go to the vale of the duddon over walna scar down to seathwaite newfield and to the rocks where the river issues from a narrow pass into the broad vale <\s>
<s> the stream is very interesting for the space of a mile above this point and below by ulpha kirk till it enters the sands where it is overlooked by the solitary mountain black comb the summit of which as that experienced surveyor colonel mudge declared commands a more extensive view than any point in britain <\s>
<s> ireland he saw more than once but not when the sun was above the horizon <\s>
<s> close by the sea lone sentinel black comb his forward station keeps he breaks the sea's tumultuous swell and ponders o'er the level deeps <\s>
<s> the boy whom i had in my mind was by no means disgusting in his appearance quite the contrary and i have known several with imperfect faculties who are handsome in their persons and features <\s>
<s> there is one at present within a mile of my own house remarkably so though he has something of a stare and vacancy in his countenance <\s>
<s> a friend of mine knowing that some persons had a dislike to the poem such as you have expressed advised me to add a stanza describing the person of the boy so as entirely to separate him in the imaginations of my readers from that class of idiots who are disgusting in their persons but the narration in the poem is so rapid and impassioned that i could not find a place in which to insert the stanza without checking the progress of it and so leaving a deadness upon the feeling <\s>
<s> this poem has i know frequently produced the same effect as it did upon you and your friends but there are many also to whom it affords exquisite delight and who indeed prefer it to any other of my poems <\s>
<s> this proves that the feelings there delineated are such as men may sympathise with <\s>
<s> this is enough for my purpose <\s>
<s> it is not enough for me as a poet to delineate merely such feelings as all men do sympathise with but it is also highly desirable to add to these others such as all men may sympathise with and such as there is reason to believe they would be better and more moral beings if they did sympathise with <\s>

<s> but first supposing the approach to be made from the south and through yorkshire there are certain interesting spots which may be confidently recommended to his notice if time can be spared before entering upon the lake district and the route may be changed in returning <\s>
<s> there are three approaches to the lakes through yorkshire the least adviseable is the great north road by catterick and greta bridge and onwards to penrith <\s>
<s> the traveller however taking this route might halt at greta bridge and be well recompenced if he can afford to give an hour or two to the banks of the greta and of the tees at rokeby <\s>
<s> barnard castle also about two miles up the tees is a striking object and the main north road might be rejoined at bowes <\s>
<s> every one has heard of the great fall of the tees above middleham interesting for its grandeur as the avenue of rocks that leads to it is to the geologist <\s>
<s> but this place lies so far out of the way as scarcely to be within the compass of our notice <\s>
<s> it might however be visited by a traveller on foot or on horseback who could rejoin the main road upon stanemoor <\s>
<s> the second road leads through a more interesting tract of country beginning at ripon from which place see fountain's abbey and thence by hackfall and masham to jervaux abbey and up the vale of wensley turning aside before askrigg is reached to see aysgarth force upon the ure and again near hawes to hardraw scar of which with its waterfall turner has a fine drawing <\s>
<s> thence over the fells to sedbergh and kendal <\s>
<s> the third approach from yorkshire is through leeds <\s>
<s> four miles beyond that town are the ruins of kirkstall abbey should that road to skipton be chosen but the other by otley may be made much more interesting by turning off at addington to bolton bridge for the sake of visiting the abbey and grounds <\s>
<s> it would be well however for a party previously to secure beds if wanted at the inn as there is but one and it is much resorted to in summer <\s>
<s> the traveller on foot or horseback would do well to follow the banks of the wharf upwards to burnsall and thence cross over the hills to gordale a noble scene beautifully described in gray's tour and with which no one can be disappointed <\s>
<s> thence to malham where there is a respectable village inn and so on by malham cove to settle <\s>
<s> travellers in carriages must go from bolton bridge to skipton where they rejoin the main road and should they be inclined to visit gordale a tolerable road turns off beyond skipton <\s>
<s> beyond settle under giggleswick scar the road passes an ebbing and flowing well worthy the notice of the naturalist <\s>
<s> four miles to the right of ingleton is weathercote cave a fine object but whoever diverges for this must return to ingleton <\s>
<s> near kirkby lonsdale observe the view from the bridge over the lune and descend to the channel of the river and by no means omit looking at the vale of lune from the church yard <\s>
<s> the journey towards the lake country through lancashire is with the exception of the vale of the ribble at preston uninteresting till you come near lancaster and obtain a view of the fells and mountains of lancashire and westmoreland with lancaster castle and the tower of the church seeming to make part of the castle in the foreground <\s>
<s> they who wish to see the celebrated ruins of furness abbey and are not afraid of crossing the sands may go from lancaster to ulverston from which place take the direct road to dalton but by all means return through urswick for the sake of the view from the top of the hill before descending into the grounds of conishead priory <\s>
<s> from this quarter the lakes would be advantageously approached by coniston thence to hawkshead and by the ferry over windermere to bowness a much better introduction than by going direct from coniston to ambleside which ought not to be done as that would greatly take off from the effect of windermere <\s>
<s> let us now go back to lancaster <\s>
<s> the direct road thence to kendal is 22 miles but by making a circuit of eight miles the vale of the lune to kirkby lonsdale will be included <\s>
<s> the whole tract is pleasing there is one view mentioned by gray and mason especially so <\s>
<s> in west's guide it is thus pointed out about a quarter of a mile beyond the third mile stone where the road makes a turn to the right there is a gate on the left which leads into a field where the station meant will be found <\s>
<s> thus far for those who approach the lakes from the south <\s>
<s> travellers from the north would do well to go from carlisle by wigton and proceed along the lake of bassenthwaite to keswick or if convenience should take them first to penrith it would still be better to cross the country to keswick and begin with that vale rather than with ulswater <\s>
<s> it is worth while to mention in this place that the banks of the river eden about corby are well worthy of notice both on account of their natural beauty and the viaducts which have recently been carried over the bed of the river and over a neighbouring ravine <\s>
<s> in the church of wetherby close by is a fine piece of monumental sculpture by nollekens <\s>
<s> the scenes of nunnery upon the eden or rather that part of them which is upon croglin a mountain stream there falling into the eden are in their way unrivalled <\s>
<s> but the nearest road thither from corby is so bad that no one can be advised to take it in a carriage <\s>
<s> nunnery may be reached from corby by making a circuit and crossing the eden at armathwaite bridge <\s>
<s> a portion of this road however is bad enough <\s>
<s> as much the greatest number of lake tourists begin by passing from kendal to bowness upon windermere our notices shall commence with that lake <\s>
<s> bowness is situated upon its eastern side and at equal distance from each extremity of the lake of windermere <\s>
<s> the lower part of this lake is rarely visited but has many interesting points of view especially at storr's hall and at fellfoot where the coniston mountains peer nobly over the western barrier which elsewhere along the whole lake is comparatively tame <\s>
<s> to one also who has ascended the hill from grathwaite on the western side the promontory called rawlinson's nab storr's hall and the troutbeck mountains about sun set make a splendid landscape <\s>
<s> the view from the pleasure house of the station near the ferry has suffered much from larch plantations this mischief however is gradually disappearing and the larches under the management of the proprietor mr <\s>
<s> curwen are giving way to the native wood <\s>
<s> windermere ought to be seen both from its shores and from its surface <\s>
<s> none of the other lakes unfold so many fresh beauties to him who sails upon them <\s>
<s> this is owing to its greater size to the islands and to its having two vales at the head with their accompanying mountains of nearly equal dignity <\s>
<s> nor can the grandeur of these two terminations be seen at once from any point except from the bosom of the lake <\s>
<s> the islands may be explored at any time of the day but one bright unruffled evening must if possible be set apart for the splendour the stillness and solemnity of a three hours voyage upon the higher division of the lake not omitting towards the end of the excursion to quit the expanse of water and peep into the close and calm river at the head which in its quiet character at such a time appears rather like an overflow of the peaceful lake itself than to have any more immediate connection with the rough mountains whence it has descended or the turbulent torrents by which it is supplied <\s>
<s> many persons content themselves with what they see of windermere during their progress in a boat from bowness to the head of the lake walking thence to ambleside <\s>
<s> but the whole road from bowness is rich in diversity of pleasing or grand scenery there is scarcely a field on the road side which if entered would not give to the landscape some additional charm <\s>
<s> low wood inn a mile from the head of windermere is a most pleasant halting place no inn in the whole district is so agreeably situated for water views and excursions and the fields above it and the lane that leads to troutbeck present beautiful views towards each extremity of the lake <\s>
<s> from this place and from ambleside rides may be taken in numerous directions and the interesting walks are inexhaustible 47 ]; a few out of the main road may be particularized the lane that leads from ambleside to skelgill the ride or walk by rothay bridge and up the stream under loughrigg fell continued on the western side of rydal lake and along the fell to the foot of grasmere lake and thence round by the church of grasmere or turning round loughrigg fell by loughrigg tarn and the river brathay back to ambleside <\s>
<s> from ambleside is another charming excursion by clappersgate where cross the brathay and proceed with the river on the right to the hamlet of skelwith fold when the houses are passed turn before you descend the hill through a gate on the right and from a rocky point is a fine view of the brathay river langdale pikes c then proceed to colwith force and up little langdale to blea tarn <\s>
<s> the scene in which this small piece of water lies suggested to the author the following description given in his poem of the excursion supposing the spectator to look down upon it not from the road but from one of its elevated sides <\s>
<s> beneath our feet a little lowly vale a lowly vale and yet uplifted high among the mountains even as if the spot had been from eldest time by wish of theirs so placed to be shut out from all the world <\s>
<s> urn like it was in shape deep as an urn with rocks encompassed save that to the south was one small opening where a heath clad ridge supplied a boundary less abrupt and close a quiet treeless nook 48 with two green fields a liquid pool that glittered in the sun and one bare dwelling one abode no more <\s>
<s> it seemed the home of poverty and toil though not of want the little fields made green by husbandry of many thrifty years paid cheerful tribute to the moorland house <\s>
<s> there crows the cock single in his domain the small birds find in spring no thicket there to shroud them only from the neighbouring vales the cuckoo straggling up to the hill tops shouteth faint tidings of some gladder place <\s>
<s> green's guide to the lakes in two vols contains a complete magazine of minute and accurate information of this kind with the names of mountains streams c <\s>
<s> 48 no longer strictly applicable on account of recent plantations <\s>
<s> from this little vale return towards ambleside by great langdale stopping if there be time to see dungeon ghyll waterfall <\s>
<s> the lake of coniston may be conveniently visited from ambleside but is seen to most advantage by entering the country over the sands from lancaster <\s>
<s> the stranger from the moment he sets his foot on those sands seems to leave the turmoil and traffic of the world behind him and crossing the majestic plain whence the sea has retired he beholds rising apparently from its base the cluster of mountains among which he is going to wander and towards whose recesses by the vale of coniston he is gradually and peacefully led <\s>
<s> from the inn at the head of coniston lake a leisurely traveller might have much pleasure in looking into yewdale and tilberthwaite returning to his inn from the head of yewdale by a mountain track which has the farm of tarn hows a little on the right by this road is seen much the best view of coniston lake from the south <\s>
<s> at the head of coniston water there is an agreeable inn from which an enterprising tourist might go to the vale of the duddon over walna scar down to seathwaite newfield and to the rocks where the river issues from a narrow pass into the broad vale <\s>
<s> the stream is very interesting for the space of a mile above this point and below by ulpha kirk till it enters the sands where it is overlooked by the solitary mountain black comb the summit of which as that experienced surveyor colonel mudge declared commands a more extensive view than any point in britain <\s>
<s> ireland he saw more than once but not when the sun was above the horizon <\s>
<s> close by the sea lone sentinel black comb his forward station keeps he breaks the sea's tumultuous swell and ponders o'er the level deeps <\s>
<s> the boy whom i had in my mind was by no means disgusting in his appearance quite the contrary and i have known several with imperfect faculties who are handsome in their persons and features <\s>
<s> there is one at present within a mile of my own house remarkably so though he has something of a stare and vacancy in his countenance <\s>
<s> a friend of mine knowing that some persons had a dislike to the poem such as you have expressed advised me to add a stanza describing the person of the boy so as entirely to separate him in the imaginations of my readers from that class of idiots who are disgusting in their persons but the narration in the poem is so rapid and impassioned that i could not find a place in which to insert the stanza without checking the progress of it and so leaving a deadness upon the feeling <\s>
<s> this poem has i know frequently produced the same effect as it did upon you and your friends but there are many also to whom it affords exquisite delight and who indeed prefer it to any other of my poems <\s>
<s> this proves that the feelings there delineated are such as men may sympathise with <\s>
<s> this is enough for my purpose <\s>
<s> it is not enough for me as a poet to delineate merely such feelings as all men do sympathise with but it is also highly desirable to add to these others such as all men may sympathise with and such as there is reason to believe they would be better and more moral beings if they did sympathise with <\s>

<s> near kirkby lonsdale observe the view from the bridge over the lune and descend to the channel of the river and by no means omit looking at the vale of lune from the church yard <\s>
<s> the journey towards the lake country through lancashire is with the exception of the vale of the ribble at preston uninteresting till you come near lancaster and obtain a view of the fells and mountains of lancashire and westmoreland with lancaster castle and the tower of the church seeming to make part of the castle in the foreground <\s>
<s> they who wish to see the celebrated ruins of furness abbey and are not afraid of crossing the sands may go from lancaster to ulverston from which place take the direct road to dalton but by all means return through urswick for the sake of the view from the top of the hill before descending into the grounds of conishead priory <\s>
<s> from this quarter the lakes would be advantageously approached by coniston thence to hawkshead and by the ferry over windermere to bowness a much better introduction than by going direct from coniston to ambleside which ought not to be done as that would greatly take off from the effect of windermere <\s>
<s> let us now go back to lancaster <\s>

<s> travellers from the north would do well to go from carlisle by wigton and proceed along the lake of bassenthwaite to keswick or if convenience should take them first to penrith it would still be better to cross the country to keswick and begin with that vale rather than with ulswater <\s>
<s> it is worth while to mention in this place that the banks of the river eden about corby are well worthy of notice both on account of their natural beauty and the viaducts which have recently been carried over the bed of the river and over a neighbouring ravine <\s>
<s> in the church of wetherby close by is a fine piece of monumental sculpture by nollekens <\s>
<s> the scenes of nunnery upon the eden or rather that part of them which is upon croglin a mountain stream there falling into the eden are in their way unrivalled <\s>

<s> a portion of this road however is bad enough <\s>
<s> as much the greatest number of lake tourists begin by passing from kendal to bowness upon windermere our notices shall commence with that lake <\s>
<s> bowness is situated upon its eastern side and at equal distance from each extremity of the lake of windermere <\s>
<s> the lower part of this lake is rarely visited but has many interesting points of view especially at storr's hall and at fellfoot where the coniston mountains peer nobly over the western barrier which elsewhere along the whole lake is comparatively tame <\s>
<s> to one also who has ascended the hill from grathwaite on the western side the promontory called rawlinson's nab storr's hall and the troutbeck mountains about sun set make a splendid landscape <\s>
<s> the view from the pleasure house of the station near the ferry has suffered much from larch plantations this mischief however is gradually disappearing and the larches under the management of the proprietor mr <\s>
<s> curwen are giving way to the native wood <\s>
<s> windermere ought to be seen both from its shores and from its surface <\s>
<s> none of the other lakes unfold so many fresh beauties to him who sails upon them <\s>
<s> this is owing to its greater size to the islands and to its having two vales at the head with their accompanying mountains of nearly equal dignity <\s>
<s> nor can the grandeur of these two terminations be seen at once from any point except from the bosom of the lake <\s>
<s> the islands may be explored at any time of the day but one bright unruffled evening must if possible be set apart for the splendour the stillness and solemnity of a three hours voyage upon the higher division of the lake not omitting towards the end of the excursion to quit the expanse of water and peep into the close and calm river at the head which in its quiet character at such a time appears rather like an overflow of the peaceful lake itself than to have any more immediate connection with the rough mountains whence it has descended or the turbulent torrents by which it is supplied <\s>
<s> many persons content themselves with what they see of windermere during their progress in a boat from bowness to the head of the lake walking thence to ambleside <\s>
<s> but the whole road from bowness is rich in diversity of pleasing or grand scenery there is scarcely a field on the road side which if entered would not give to the landscape some additional charm <\s>
<s> low wood inn a mile from the head of windermere is a most pleasant halting place no inn in the whole district is so agreeably situated for water views and excursions and the fields above it and the lane that leads to troutbeck present beautiful views towards each extremity of the lake <\s>

<s> from ambleside is another charming excursion by clappersgate where cross the brathay and proceed with the river on the right to the hamlet of skelwith fold when the houses are passed turn before you descend the hill through a gate on the right and from a rocky point is a fine view of the brathay river langdale pikes c then proceed to colwith force and up little langdale to blea tarn <\s>

<s> the journey towards the lake country through lancashire is with the exception of the vale of the ribble at preston uninteresting till you come near lancaster and obtain a view of the fells and mountains of lancashire and westmoreland with lancaster castle and the tower of the church seeming to make part of the castle in the foreground <\s>
<s> they who wish to see the celebrated ruins of furness abbey and are not afraid of crossing the sands may go from lancaster to ulverston from which place take the direct road to dalton but by all means return through urswick for the sake of the view from the top of the hill before descending into the grounds of conishead priory <\s>
<s> from this quarter the lakes would be advantageously approached by coniston thence to hawkshead and by the ferry over windermere to bowness a much better introduction than by going direct from coniston to ambleside which ought not to be done as that would greatly take off from the effect of windermere <\s>
<s> let us now go back to lancaster <\s>

<s> travellers from the north would do well to go from carlisle by wigton and proceed along the lake of bassenthwaite to keswick or if convenience should take them first to penrith it would still be better to cross the country to keswick and begin with that vale rather than with ulswater <\s>
<s> it is worth while to mention in this place that the banks of the river eden about corby are well worthy of notice both on account of their natural beauty and the viaducts which have recently been carried over the bed of the river and over a neighbouring ravine <\s>
<s> in the church of wetherby close by is a fine piece of monumental sculpture by nollekens <\s>
<s> the scenes of nunnery upon the eden or rather that part of them which is upon croglin a mountain stream there falling into the eden are in their way unrivalled <\s>

<s> as much the greatest number of lake tourists begin by passing from kendal to bowness upon windermere our notices shall commence with that lake <\s>
<s> bowness is situated upon its eastern side and at equal distance from each extremity of the lake of windermere <\s>
<s> the lower part of this lake is rarely visited but has many interesting points of view especially at storr's hall and at fellfoot where the coniston mountains peer nobly over the western barrier which elsewhere along the whole lake is comparatively tame <\s>
<s> to one also who has ascended the hill from grathwaite on the western side the promontory called rawlinson's nab storr's hall and the troutbeck mountains about sun set make a splendid landscape <\s>
<s> the view from the pleasure house of the station near the ferry has suffered much from larch plantations this mischief however is gradually disappearing and the larches under the management of the proprietor mr <\s>
<s> curwen are giving way to the native wood <\s>
<s> windermere ought to be seen both from its shores and from its surface <\s>
<s> none of the other lakes unfold so many fresh beauties to him who sails upon them <\s>
<s> this is owing to its greater size to the islands and to its having two vales at the head with their accompanying mountains of nearly equal dignity <\s>
<s> nor can the grandeur of these two terminations be seen at once from any point except from the bosom of the lake <\s>
<s> the islands may be explored at any time of the day but one bright unruffled evening must if possible be set apart for the splendour the stillness and solemnity of a three hours voyage upon the higher division of the lake not omitting towards the end of the excursion to quit the expanse of water and peep into the close and calm river at the head which in its quiet character at such a time appears rather like an overflow of the peaceful lake itself than to have any more immediate connection with the rough mountains whence it has descended or the turbulent torrents by which it is supplied <\s>
<s> many persons content themselves with what they see of windermere during their progress in a boat from bowness to the head of the lake walking thence to ambleside <\s>
<s> but the whole road from bowness is rich in diversity of pleasing or grand scenery there is scarcely a field on the road side which if entered would not give to the landscape some additional charm <\s>
<s> low wood inn a mile from the head of windermere is a most pleasant halting place no inn in the whole district is so agreeably situated for water views and excursions and the fields above it and the lane that leads to troutbeck present beautiful views towards each extremity of the lake <\s>
<s> from this place and from ambleside rides may be taken in numerous directions and the interesting walks are inexhaustible 47 ]; a few out of the main road may be particularized the lane that leads from ambleside to skelgill the ride or walk by rothay bridge and up the stream under loughrigg fell continued on the western side of rydal lake and along the fell to the foot of grasmere lake and thence round by the church of grasmere or turning round loughrigg fell by loughrigg tarn and the river brathay back to ambleside <\s>
<s> from ambleside is another charming excursion by clappersgate where cross the brathay and proceed with the river on the right to the hamlet of skelwith fold when the houses are passed turn before you descend the hill through a gate on the right and from a rocky point is a fine view of the brathay river langdale pikes c then proceed to colwith force and up little langdale to blea tarn <\s>

<s> for the more sure attainment however of this primary object he will begin by undertaking the humble and tedious task of supplying the tourist with directions how to approach the several scenes in their best or most convenient order <\s>
<s> but first supposing the approach to be made from the south and through yorkshire there are certain interesting spots which may be confidently recommended to his notice if time can be spared before entering upon the lake district and the route may be changed in returning <\s>

<s> but this place lies so far out of the way as scarcely to be within the compass of our notice <\s>

<s> from this quarter the lakes would be advantageously approached by coniston thence to hawkshead and by the ferry over windermere to bowness a much better introduction than by going direct from coniston to ambleside which ought not to be done as that would greatly take off from the effect of windermere <\s>

<s> travellers from the north would do well to go from carlisle by wigton and proceed along the lake of bassenthwaite to keswick or if convenience should take them first to penrith it would still be better to cross the country to keswick and begin with that vale rather than with ulswater <\s>
<s> it is worth while to mention in this place that the banks of the river eden about corby are well worthy of notice both on account of their natural beauty and the viaducts which have recently been carried over the bed of the river and over a neighbouring ravine <\s>
<s> in the church of wetherby close by is a fine piece of monumental sculpture by nollekens <\s>
<s> the scenes of nunnery upon the eden or rather that part of them which is upon croglin a mountain stream there falling into the eden are in their way unrivalled <\s>

<s> as much the greatest number of lake tourists begin by passing from kendal to bowness upon windermere our notices shall commence with that lake <\s>

<s> the lower part of this lake is rarely visited but has many interesting points of view especially at storr's hall and at fellfoot where the coniston mountains peer nobly over the western barrier which elsewhere along the whole lake is comparatively tame <\s>

<s> curwen are giving way to the native wood <\s>
<s> windermere ought to be seen both from its shores and from its surface <\s>
<s> none of the other lakes unfold so many fresh beauties to him who sails upon them <\s>
<s> this is owing to its greater size to the islands and to its having two vales at the head with their accompanying mountains of nearly equal dignity <\s>
<s> nor can the grandeur of these two terminations be seen at once from any point except from the bosom of the lake <\s>
<s> the islands may be explored at any time of the day but one bright unruffled evening must if possible be set apart for the splendour the stillness and solemnity of a three hours voyage upon the higher division of the lake not omitting towards the end of the excursion to quit the expanse of water and peep into the close and calm river at the head which in its quiet character at such a time appears rather like an overflow of the peaceful lake itself than to have any more immediate connection with the rough mountains whence it has descended or the turbulent torrents by which it is supplied <\s>
<s> many persons content themselves with what they see of windermere during their progress in a boat from bowness to the head of the lake walking thence to ambleside <\s>
<s> but the whole road from bowness is rich in diversity of pleasing or grand scenery there is scarcely a field on the road side which if entered would not give to the landscape some additional charm <\s>
<s> low wood inn a mile from the head of windermere is a most pleasant halting place no inn in the whole district is so agreeably situated for water views and excursions and the fields above it and the lane that leads to troutbeck present beautiful views towards each extremity of the lake <\s>

<s> for the more sure attainment however of this primary object he will begin by undertaking the humble and tedious task of supplying the tourist with directions how to approach the several scenes in their best or most convenient order <\s>
<s> but first supposing the approach to be made from the south and through yorkshire there are certain interesting spots which may be confidently recommended to his notice if time can be spared before entering upon the lake district and the route may be changed in returning <\s>
<s> there are three approaches to the lakes through yorkshire the least adviseable is the great north road by catterick and greta bridge and onwards to penrith <\s>
<s> the traveller however taking this route might halt at greta bridge and be well recompenced if he can afford to give an hour or two to the banks of the greta and of the tees at rokeby <\s>

<s> every one has heard of the great fall of the tees above middleham interesting for its grandeur as the avenue of rocks that leads to it is to the geologist <\s>
<s> but this place lies so far out of the way as scarcely to be within the compass of our notice <\s>
<s> it might however be visited by a traveller on foot or on horseback who could rejoin the main road upon stanemoor <\s>

<s> thence over the fells to sedbergh and kendal <\s>
<s> the third approach from yorkshire is through leeds <\s>
<s> four miles beyond that town are the ruins of kirkstall abbey should that road to skipton be chosen but the other by otley may be made much more interesting by turning off at addington to bolton bridge for the sake of visiting the abbey and grounds <\s>
<s> it would be well however for a party previously to secure beds if wanted at the inn as there is but one and it is much resorted to in summer <\s>
<s> the traveller on foot or horseback would do well to follow the banks of the wharf upwards to burnsall and thence cross over the hills to gordale a noble scene beautifully described in gray's tour and with which no one can be disappointed <\s>

<s> let us now go back to lancaster <\s>
<s> the direct road thence to kendal is 22 miles but by making a circuit of eight miles the vale of the lune to kirkby lonsdale will be included <\s>
<s> the whole tract is pleasing there is one view mentioned by gray and mason especially so <\s>
<s> in west's guide it is thus pointed out about a quarter of a mile beyond the third mile stone where the road makes a turn to the right there is a gate on the left which leads into a field where the station meant will be found <\s>
<s> thus far for those who approach the lakes from the south <\s>
<s> travellers from the north would do well to go from carlisle by wigton and proceed along the lake of bassenthwaite to keswick or if convenience should take them first to penrith it would still be better to cross the country to keswick and begin with that vale rather than with ulswater <\s>
<s> it is worth while to mention in this place that the banks of the river eden about corby are well worthy of notice both on account of their natural beauty and the viaducts which have recently been carried over the bed of the river and over a neighbouring ravine <\s>
<s> in the church of wetherby close by is a fine piece of monumental sculpture by nollekens <\s>
<s> the scenes of nunnery upon the eden or rather that part of them which is upon croglin a mountain stream there falling into the eden are in their way unrivalled <\s>
<s> but the nearest road thither from corby is so bad that no one can be advised to take it in a carriage <\s>
<s> nunnery may be reached from corby by making a circuit and crossing the eden at armathwaite bridge <\s>
<s> a portion of this road however is bad enough <\s>
<s> as much the greatest number of lake tourists begin by passing from kendal to bowness upon windermere our notices shall commence with that lake <\s>
<s> bowness is situated upon its eastern side and at equal distance from each extremity of the lake of windermere <\s>
<s> the lower part of this lake is rarely visited but has many interesting points of view especially at storr's hall and at fellfoot where the coniston mountains peer nobly over the western barrier which elsewhere along the whole lake is comparatively tame <\s>
<s> to one also who has ascended the hill from grathwaite on the western side the promontory called rawlinson's nab storr's hall and the troutbeck mountains about sun set make a splendid landscape <\s>
<s> the view from the pleasure house of the station near the ferry has suffered much from larch plantations this mischief however is gradually disappearing and the larches under the management of the proprietor mr <\s>
<s> curwen are giving way to the native wood <\s>
<s> windermere ought to be seen both from its shores and from its surface <\s>
<s> none of the other lakes unfold so many fresh beauties to him who sails upon them <\s>
<s> this is owing to its greater size to the islands and to its having two vales at the head with their accompanying mountains of nearly equal dignity <\s>
<s> nor can the grandeur of these two terminations be seen at once from any point except from the bosom of the lake <\s>
<s> the islands may be explored at any time of the day but one bright unruffled evening must if possible be set apart for the splendour the stillness and solemnity of a three hours voyage upon the higher division of the lake not omitting towards the end of the excursion to quit the expanse of water and peep into the close and calm river at the head which in its quiet character at such a time appears rather like an overflow of the peaceful lake itself than to have any more immediate connection with the rough mountains whence it has descended or the turbulent torrents by which it is supplied <\s>
<s> many persons content themselves with what they see of windermere during their progress in a boat from bowness to the head of the lake walking thence to ambleside <\s>
<s> but the whole road from bowness is rich in diversity of pleasing or grand scenery there is scarcely a field on the road side which if entered would not give to the landscape some additional charm <\s>
<s> low wood inn a mile from the head of windermere is a most pleasant halting place no inn in the whole district is so agreeably situated for water views and excursions and the fields above it and the lane that leads to troutbeck present beautiful views towards each extremity of the lake <\s>
<s> from this place and from ambleside rides may be taken in numerous directions and the interesting walks are inexhaustible 47 ]; a few out of the main road may be particularized the lane that leads from ambleside to skelgill the ride or walk by rothay bridge and up the stream under loughrigg fell continued on the western side of rydal lake and along the fell to the foot of grasmere lake and thence round by the church of grasmere or turning round loughrigg fell by loughrigg tarn and the river brathay back to ambleside <\s>
<s> from ambleside is another charming excursion by clappersgate where cross the brathay and proceed with the river on the right to the hamlet of skelwith fold when the houses are passed turn before you descend the hill through a gate on the right and from a rocky point is a fine view of the brathay river langdale pikes c then proceed to colwith force and up little langdale to blea tarn <\s>
<s> the scene in which this small piece of water lies suggested to the author the following description given in his poem of the excursion supposing the spectator to look down upon it not from the road but from one of its elevated sides <\s>
<s> beneath our feet a little lowly vale a lowly vale and yet uplifted high among the mountains even as if the spot had been from eldest time by wish of theirs so placed to be shut out from all the world <\s>
<s> urn like it was in shape deep as an urn with rocks encompassed save that to the south was one small opening where a heath clad ridge supplied a boundary less abrupt and close a quiet treeless nook 48 with two green fields a liquid pool that glittered in the sun and one bare dwelling one abode no more <\s>
<s> it seemed the home of poverty and toil though not of want the little fields made green by husbandry of many thrifty years paid cheerful tribute to the moorland house <\s>
<s> there crows the cock single in his domain the small birds find in spring no thicket there to shroud them only from the neighbouring vales the cuckoo straggling up to the hill tops shouteth faint tidings of some gladder place <\s>
<s> green's guide to the lakes in two vols contains a complete magazine of minute and accurate information of this kind with the names of mountains streams c <\s>
<s> 48 no longer strictly applicable on account of recent plantations <\s>
<s> from this little vale return towards ambleside by great langdale stopping if there be time to see dungeon ghyll waterfall <\s>
<s> the lake of coniston may be conveniently visited from ambleside but is seen to most advantage by entering the country over the sands from lancaster <\s>
<s> the stranger from the moment he sets his foot on those sands seems to leave the turmoil and traffic of the world behind him and crossing the majestic plain whence the sea has retired he beholds rising apparently from its base the cluster of mountains among which he is going to wander and towards whose recesses by the vale of coniston he is gradually and peacefully led <\s>
<s> from the inn at the head of coniston lake a leisurely traveller might have much pleasure in looking into yewdale and tilberthwaite returning to his inn from the head of yewdale by a mountain track which has the farm of tarn hows a little on the right by this road is seen much the best view of coniston lake from the south <\s>
<s> at the head of coniston water there is an agreeable inn from which an enterprising tourist might go to the vale of the duddon over walna scar down to seathwaite newfield and to the rocks where the river issues from a narrow pass into the broad vale <\s>
<s> the stream is very interesting for the space of a mile above this point and below by ulpha kirk till it enters the sands where it is overlooked by the solitary mountain black comb the summit of which as that experienced surveyor colonel mudge declared commands a more extensive view than any point in britain <\s>
<s> ireland he saw more than once but not when the sun was above the horizon <\s>
<s> close by the sea lone sentinel black comb his forward station keeps he breaks the sea's tumultuous swell and ponders o'er the level deeps <\s>

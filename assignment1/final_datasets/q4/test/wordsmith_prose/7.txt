<s> now it may be observed first that even if the investigation had not been a public one it might have reasonably been concluded from the circumstance of the board having omitted to report any opinion concerning the terms of the armistice and the convention that those terms had not occupied enough of its attention to justify the board in giving any opinion upon them whether of approbation or disapprobation and secondly this conclusion which might have been made ?priori is confirmed by the actual fact that no examination or inquiry of this kind appears throughout the report of its proceedings and therefore any opinion subsequently given in consequence of the requisition of the commander in chief can lay claim to no more authority upon these points than the opinion of the same men if they had never sat in a public court upon this question <\s>

<s> for the reason assigned in their first report for deeming no further military proceedings necessary is because it appears that unquestionable zeal and firmness were exhibited throughout by the several general officers and the reason assigned by those three who condemn the convention is that the generals did not insist upon the terms to which they were entitled that is in direct opposition to their former opinions the generals shewed a want of firmness and zeal <\s>
<s> if then the generals were acquitted in the first case solely upon the ground of having displayed firmness and zeal a confessed want of firmness and zeal in the second case implies conversely a ground of censure rendering in the opinions of these three members further military proceedings absolutely necessary <\s>
<s> they who are most aware of the unconstitutional frame of this court or board and of the perplexing situation in which its members must have found themselves placed will have the least difficulty in excusing this inconsistency it is however to be regretted particularly in the instance of the earl of moira who disapproving both of the convention and armistice has assigned for that disapprobation unanswerable reasons drawn not from hidden sources unapproachable except by judicial investigation but from facts known to all the world <\s>
<s> the reader will excuse this long note to which however i must add one word is it not strange that in the general decision of the board zeal and firmness nakedly considered and without question of their union with judgment and such other qualities as can alone give them any value should be assumed as sufficient grounds on which to rest the acquittal of men lying under a charge of military delinquency <\s>
<s> it is not necessary to add that one of these fears was removed by the actual landing of ten thousand men under sir j <\s>

<s> but the argument is complete without it <\s>
<s> i was unwilling to interrupt the reader upon a slight occasion but i cannot refrain from adding here a word or two by way of comment i have said at page 71 speaking of junot's army that the british were to encounter the same men c <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley before the board of inquiry disallowed this supposition affirming that junot's army had not then reached spain nor could be there for some time <\s>

<s> what did it matter whether the british were again to measure swords with these identical men whether these men were even to appear again upon spanish ground <\s>
<s> it was enough that if these did not others would who could not have been brought to that service but that these had been released and were doing elsewhere some other service for their master enough that every thing was provided by the british to land them as near the spanish frontier and as speedily as they could desire <\s>
<s> this attempt the reader will recollect is not new to our country it was accomplished at one aera of our history in that memorable act of an english parliament which made it unlawful for any man to ask his neighbour to join him in a petition for redress of grievances and which thus denied the people the benefit of tears and prayers to their own infamous deputies <\s>

<s> to two of these questions viz <\s>
<s> those which relate to the particular armistice and convention made by the british generals the members of the board still persevering in their blindness to the other two which express doubt as to the lawfulness of any armistice or convention severally return answers which convey an approbation of the armistice and convention by four members a disapprobation of the convention by the remaining three and further a disapprobation of the armistice by one of those three <\s>
<s> now it may be observed first that even if the investigation had not been a public one it might have reasonably been concluded from the circumstance of the board having omitted to report any opinion concerning the terms of the armistice and the convention that those terms had not occupied enough of its attention to justify the board in giving any opinion upon them whether of approbation or disapprobation and secondly this conclusion which might have been made ?priori is confirmed by the actual fact that no examination or inquiry of this kind appears throughout the report of its proceedings and therefore any opinion subsequently given in consequence of the requisition of the commander in chief can lay claim to no more authority upon these points than the opinion of the same men if they had never sat in a public court upon this question <\s>
<s> in this condition are all the members whether they approve or disapprove of the convention <\s>
<s> and with respect to the three who disapprove of the convention over and above the general impropriety of having under these circumstances pronounced a verdict at all in the character of members of that board they are subject to an especial charge of inconsistency in having given such an opinion in their second report as renders nugatory that which they first pronounced <\s>
<s> for the reason assigned in their first report for deeming no further military proceedings necessary is because it appears that unquestionable zeal and firmness were exhibited throughout by the several general officers and the reason assigned by those three who condemn the convention is that the generals did not insist upon the terms to which they were entitled that is in direct opposition to their former opinions the generals shewed a want of firmness and zeal <\s>
<s> if then the generals were acquitted in the first case solely upon the ground of having displayed firmness and zeal a confessed want of firmness and zeal in the second case implies conversely a ground of censure rendering in the opinions of these three members further military proceedings absolutely necessary <\s>
<s> they who are most aware of the unconstitutional frame of this court or board and of the perplexing situation in which its members must have found themselves placed will have the least difficulty in excusing this inconsistency it is however to be regretted particularly in the instance of the earl of moira who disapproving both of the convention and armistice has assigned for that disapprobation unanswerable reasons drawn not from hidden sources unapproachable except by judicial investigation but from facts known to all the world <\s>
<s> the reader will excuse this long note to which however i must add one word is it not strange that in the general decision of the board zeal and firmness nakedly considered and without question of their union with judgment and such other qualities as can alone give them any value should be assumed as sufficient grounds on which to rest the acquittal of men lying under a charge of military delinquency <\s>

<s> to two of these questions viz <\s>
<s> those which relate to the particular armistice and convention made by the british generals the members of the board still persevering in their blindness to the other two which express doubt as to the lawfulness of any armistice or convention severally return answers which convey an approbation of the armistice and convention by four members a disapprobation of the convention by the remaining three and further a disapprobation of the armistice by one of those three <\s>
<s> now it may be observed first that even if the investigation had not been a public one it might have reasonably been concluded from the circumstance of the board having omitted to report any opinion concerning the terms of the armistice and the convention that those terms had not occupied enough of its attention to justify the board in giving any opinion upon them whether of approbation or disapprobation and secondly this conclusion which might have been made ?priori is confirmed by the actual fact that no examination or inquiry of this kind appears throughout the report of its proceedings and therefore any opinion subsequently given in consequence of the requisition of the commander in chief can lay claim to no more authority upon these points than the opinion of the same men if they had never sat in a public court upon this question <\s>
<s> in this condition are all the members whether they approve or disapprove of the convention <\s>
<s> and with respect to the three who disapprove of the convention over and above the general impropriety of having under these circumstances pronounced a verdict at all in the character of members of that board they are subject to an especial charge of inconsistency in having given such an opinion in their second report as renders nugatory that which they first pronounced <\s>
<s> for the reason assigned in their first report for deeming no further military proceedings necessary is because it appears that unquestionable zeal and firmness were exhibited throughout by the several general officers and the reason assigned by those three who condemn the convention is that the generals did not insist upon the terms to which they were entitled that is in direct opposition to their former opinions the generals shewed a want of firmness and zeal <\s>
<s> if then the generals were acquitted in the first case solely upon the ground of having displayed firmness and zeal a confessed want of firmness and zeal in the second case implies conversely a ground of censure rendering in the opinions of these three members further military proceedings absolutely necessary <\s>
<s> they who are most aware of the unconstitutional frame of this court or board and of the perplexing situation in which its members must have found themselves placed will have the least difficulty in excusing this inconsistency it is however to be regretted particularly in the instance of the earl of moira who disapproving both of the convention and armistice has assigned for that disapprobation unanswerable reasons drawn not from hidden sources unapproachable except by judicial investigation but from facts known to all the world <\s>
<s> the reader will excuse this long note to which however i must add one word is it not strange that in the general decision of the board zeal and firmness nakedly considered and without question of their union with judgment and such other qualities as can alone give them any value should be assumed as sufficient grounds on which to rest the acquittal of men lying under a charge of military delinquency <\s>
<s> it is not necessary to add that one of these fears was removed by the actual landing of ten thousand men under sir j <\s>
<s> moore pending the negotiation and yet no change in the terms took place in consequence <\s>
<s> this was an important circumstance and of itself determined two of the members of the board of inquiry to disapprove of the convention such an accession entitling sir h <\s>
<s> dalrymple and of course making it his duty to insist on more favourable terms <\s>
<s> but the argument is complete without it <\s>
<s> i was unwilling to interrupt the reader upon a slight occasion but i cannot refrain from adding here a word or two by way of comment i have said at page 71 speaking of junot's army that the british were to encounter the same men c <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley before the board of inquiry disallowed this supposition affirming that junot's army had not then reached spain nor could be there for some time <\s>
<s> grant this was it not stipulated that a messenger should be sent off immediately after the conclusion of the treaty to buonaparte apprising him of its terms and when he might expect his troops and would not this enable him to hurry forward forces to the spanish frontiers and to bring them into action knowing that these troops of junot's would be ready to support him <\s>
<s> what did it matter whether the british were again to measure swords with these identical men whether these men were even to appear again upon spanish ground <\s>
<s> it was enough that if these did not others would who could not have been brought to that service but that these had been released and were doing elsewhere some other service for their master enough that every thing was provided by the british to land them as near the spanish frontier and as speedily as they could desire <\s>

<s> done and concluded at lisbon this 30th day of august 1808 <\s>
<s> to two of these questions viz <\s>
<s> those which relate to the particular armistice and convention made by the british generals the members of the board still persevering in their blindness to the other two which express doubt as to the lawfulness of any armistice or convention severally return answers which convey an approbation of the armistice and convention by four members a disapprobation of the convention by the remaining three and further a disapprobation of the armistice by one of those three <\s>
<s> now it may be observed first that even if the investigation had not been a public one it might have reasonably been concluded from the circumstance of the board having omitted to report any opinion concerning the terms of the armistice and the convention that those terms had not occupied enough of its attention to justify the board in giving any opinion upon them whether of approbation or disapprobation and secondly this conclusion which might have been made ?priori is confirmed by the actual fact that no examination or inquiry of this kind appears throughout the report of its proceedings and therefore any opinion subsequently given in consequence of the requisition of the commander in chief can lay claim to no more authority upon these points than the opinion of the same men if they had never sat in a public court upon this question <\s>
<s> in this condition are all the members whether they approve or disapprove of the convention <\s>
<s> and with respect to the three who disapprove of the convention over and above the general impropriety of having under these circumstances pronounced a verdict at all in the character of members of that board they are subject to an especial charge of inconsistency in having given such an opinion in their second report as renders nugatory that which they first pronounced <\s>
<s> for the reason assigned in their first report for deeming no further military proceedings necessary is because it appears that unquestionable zeal and firmness were exhibited throughout by the several general officers and the reason assigned by those three who condemn the convention is that the generals did not insist upon the terms to which they were entitled that is in direct opposition to their former opinions the generals shewed a want of firmness and zeal <\s>
<s> if then the generals were acquitted in the first case solely upon the ground of having displayed firmness and zeal a confessed want of firmness and zeal in the second case implies conversely a ground of censure rendering in the opinions of these three members further military proceedings absolutely necessary <\s>
<s> they who are most aware of the unconstitutional frame of this court or board and of the perplexing situation in which its members must have found themselves placed will have the least difficulty in excusing this inconsistency it is however to be regretted particularly in the instance of the earl of moira who disapproving both of the convention and armistice has assigned for that disapprobation unanswerable reasons drawn not from hidden sources unapproachable except by judicial investigation but from facts known to all the world <\s>
<s> the reader will excuse this long note to which however i must add one word is it not strange that in the general decision of the board zeal and firmness nakedly considered and without question of their union with judgment and such other qualities as can alone give them any value should be assumed as sufficient grounds on which to rest the acquittal of men lying under a charge of military delinquency <\s>
<s> it is not necessary to add that one of these fears was removed by the actual landing of ten thousand men under sir j <\s>
<s> moore pending the negotiation and yet no change in the terms took place in consequence <\s>
<s> this was an important circumstance and of itself determined two of the members of the board of inquiry to disapprove of the convention such an accession entitling sir h <\s>
<s> dalrymple and of course making it his duty to insist on more favourable terms <\s>
<s> but the argument is complete without it <\s>
<s> i was unwilling to interrupt the reader upon a slight occasion but i cannot refrain from adding here a word or two by way of comment i have said at page 71 speaking of junot's army that the british were to encounter the same men c <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley before the board of inquiry disallowed this supposition affirming that junot's army had not then reached spain nor could be there for some time <\s>
<s> grant this was it not stipulated that a messenger should be sent off immediately after the conclusion of the treaty to buonaparte apprising him of its terms and when he might expect his troops and would not this enable him to hurry forward forces to the spanish frontiers and to bring them into action knowing that these troops of junot's would be ready to support him <\s>
<s> what did it matter whether the british were again to measure swords with these identical men whether these men were even to appear again upon spanish ground <\s>
<s> it was enough that if these did not others would who could not have been brought to that service but that these had been released and were doing elsewhere some other service for their master enough that every thing was provided by the british to land them as near the spanish frontier and as speedily as they could desire <\s>

<s> done and concluded at lisbon this 30th day of august 1808 <\s>
<s> to two of these questions viz <\s>
<s> those which relate to the particular armistice and convention made by the british generals the members of the board still persevering in their blindness to the other two which express doubt as to the lawfulness of any armistice or convention severally return answers which convey an approbation of the armistice and convention by four members a disapprobation of the convention by the remaining three and further a disapprobation of the armistice by one of those three <\s>
<s> now it may be observed first that even if the investigation had not been a public one it might have reasonably been concluded from the circumstance of the board having omitted to report any opinion concerning the terms of the armistice and the convention that those terms had not occupied enough of its attention to justify the board in giving any opinion upon them whether of approbation or disapprobation and secondly this conclusion which might have been made ?priori is confirmed by the actual fact that no examination or inquiry of this kind appears throughout the report of its proceedings and therefore any opinion subsequently given in consequence of the requisition of the commander in chief can lay claim to no more authority upon these points than the opinion of the same men if they had never sat in a public court upon this question <\s>
<s> in this condition are all the members whether they approve or disapprove of the convention <\s>
<s> and with respect to the three who disapprove of the convention over and above the general impropriety of having under these circumstances pronounced a verdict at all in the character of members of that board they are subject to an especial charge of inconsistency in having given such an opinion in their second report as renders nugatory that which they first pronounced <\s>
<s> for the reason assigned in their first report for deeming no further military proceedings necessary is because it appears that unquestionable zeal and firmness were exhibited throughout by the several general officers and the reason assigned by those three who condemn the convention is that the generals did not insist upon the terms to which they were entitled that is in direct opposition to their former opinions the generals shewed a want of firmness and zeal <\s>
<s> if then the generals were acquitted in the first case solely upon the ground of having displayed firmness and zeal a confessed want of firmness and zeal in the second case implies conversely a ground of censure rendering in the opinions of these three members further military proceedings absolutely necessary <\s>
<s> they who are most aware of the unconstitutional frame of this court or board and of the perplexing situation in which its members must have found themselves placed will have the least difficulty in excusing this inconsistency it is however to be regretted particularly in the instance of the earl of moira who disapproving both of the convention and armistice has assigned for that disapprobation unanswerable reasons drawn not from hidden sources unapproachable except by judicial investigation but from facts known to all the world <\s>
<s> the reader will excuse this long note to which however i must add one word is it not strange that in the general decision of the board zeal and firmness nakedly considered and without question of their union with judgment and such other qualities as can alone give them any value should be assumed as sufficient grounds on which to rest the acquittal of men lying under a charge of military delinquency <\s>
<s> it is not necessary to add that one of these fears was removed by the actual landing of ten thousand men under sir j <\s>
<s> moore pending the negotiation and yet no change in the terms took place in consequence <\s>
<s> this was an important circumstance and of itself determined two of the members of the board of inquiry to disapprove of the convention such an accession entitling sir h <\s>
<s> dalrymple and of course making it his duty to insist on more favourable terms <\s>
<s> but the argument is complete without it <\s>
<s> i was unwilling to interrupt the reader upon a slight occasion but i cannot refrain from adding here a word or two by way of comment i have said at page 71 speaking of junot's army that the british were to encounter the same men c <\s>

<s> it was enough that if these did not others would who could not have been brought to that service but that these had been released and were doing elsewhere some other service for their master enough that every thing was provided by the british to land them as near the spanish frontier and as speedily as they could desire <\s>

<s> now it may be observed first that even if the investigation had not been a public one it might have reasonably been concluded from the circumstance of the board having omitted to report any opinion concerning the terms of the armistice and the convention that those terms had not occupied enough of its attention to justify the board in giving any opinion upon them whether of approbation or disapprobation and secondly this conclusion which might have been made ?priori is confirmed by the actual fact that no examination or inquiry of this kind appears throughout the report of its proceedings and therefore any opinion subsequently given in consequence of the requisition of the commander in chief can lay claim to no more authority upon these points than the opinion of the same men if they had never sat in a public court upon this question <\s>

<s> for the reason assigned in their first report for deeming no further military proceedings necessary is because it appears that unquestionable zeal and firmness were exhibited throughout by the several general officers and the reason assigned by those three who condemn the convention is that the generals did not insist upon the terms to which they were entitled that is in direct opposition to their former opinions the generals shewed a want of firmness and zeal <\s>
<s> if then the generals were acquitted in the first case solely upon the ground of having displayed firmness and zeal a confessed want of firmness and zeal in the second case implies conversely a ground of censure rendering in the opinions of these three members further military proceedings absolutely necessary <\s>
<s> they who are most aware of the unconstitutional frame of this court or board and of the perplexing situation in which its members must have found themselves placed will have the least difficulty in excusing this inconsistency it is however to be regretted particularly in the instance of the earl of moira who disapproving both of the convention and armistice has assigned for that disapprobation unanswerable reasons drawn not from hidden sources unapproachable except by judicial investigation but from facts known to all the world <\s>
<s> the reader will excuse this long note to which however i must add one word is it not strange that in the general decision of the board zeal and firmness nakedly considered and without question of their union with judgment and such other qualities as can alone give them any value should be assumed as sufficient grounds on which to rest the acquittal of men lying under a charge of military delinquency <\s>
<s> it is not necessary to add that one of these fears was removed by the actual landing of ten thousand men under sir j <\s>

<s> but the argument is complete without it <\s>
<s> i was unwilling to interrupt the reader upon a slight occasion but i cannot refrain from adding here a word or two by way of comment i have said at page 71 speaking of junot's army that the british were to encounter the same men c <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley before the board of inquiry disallowed this supposition affirming that junot's army had not then reached spain nor could be there for some time <\s>

<s> what did it matter whether the british were again to measure swords with these identical men whether these men were even to appear again upon spanish ground <\s>
<s> it was enough that if these did not others would who could not have been brought to that service but that these had been released and were doing elsewhere some other service for their master enough that every thing was provided by the british to land them as near the spanish frontier and as speedily as they could desire <\s>
<s> this attempt the reader will recollect is not new to our country it was accomplished at one aera of our history in that memorable act of an english parliament which made it unlawful for any man to ask his neighbour to join him in a petition for redress of grievances and which thus denied the people the benefit of tears and prayers to their own infamous deputies <\s>

<s> to two of these questions viz <\s>
<s> those which relate to the particular armistice and convention made by the british generals the members of the board still persevering in their blindness to the other two which express doubt as to the lawfulness of any armistice or convention severally return answers which convey an approbation of the armistice and convention by four members a disapprobation of the convention by the remaining three and further a disapprobation of the armistice by one of those three <\s>
<s> now it may be observed first that even if the investigation had not been a public one it might have reasonably been concluded from the circumstance of the board having omitted to report any opinion concerning the terms of the armistice and the convention that those terms had not occupied enough of its attention to justify the board in giving any opinion upon them whether of approbation or disapprobation and secondly this conclusion which might have been made ?priori is confirmed by the actual fact that no examination or inquiry of this kind appears throughout the report of its proceedings and therefore any opinion subsequently given in consequence of the requisition of the commander in chief can lay claim to no more authority upon these points than the opinion of the same men if they had never sat in a public court upon this question <\s>
<s> in this condition are all the members whether they approve or disapprove of the convention <\s>
<s> and with respect to the three who disapprove of the convention over and above the general impropriety of having under these circumstances pronounced a verdict at all in the character of members of that board they are subject to an especial charge of inconsistency in having given such an opinion in their second report as renders nugatory that which they first pronounced <\s>
<s> for the reason assigned in their first report for deeming no further military proceedings necessary is because it appears that unquestionable zeal and firmness were exhibited throughout by the several general officers and the reason assigned by those three who condemn the convention is that the generals did not insist upon the terms to which they were entitled that is in direct opposition to their former opinions the generals shewed a want of firmness and zeal <\s>
<s> if then the generals were acquitted in the first case solely upon the ground of having displayed firmness and zeal a confessed want of firmness and zeal in the second case implies conversely a ground of censure rendering in the opinions of these three members further military proceedings absolutely necessary <\s>
<s> they who are most aware of the unconstitutional frame of this court or board and of the perplexing situation in which its members must have found themselves placed will have the least difficulty in excusing this inconsistency it is however to be regretted particularly in the instance of the earl of moira who disapproving both of the convention and armistice has assigned for that disapprobation unanswerable reasons drawn not from hidden sources unapproachable except by judicial investigation but from facts known to all the world <\s>
<s> the reader will excuse this long note to which however i must add one word is it not strange that in the general decision of the board zeal and firmness nakedly considered and without question of their union with judgment and such other qualities as can alone give them any value should be assumed as sufficient grounds on which to rest the acquittal of men lying under a charge of military delinquency <\s>

<s> to two of these questions viz <\s>
<s> those which relate to the particular armistice and convention made by the british generals the members of the board still persevering in their blindness to the other two which express doubt as to the lawfulness of any armistice or convention severally return answers which convey an approbation of the armistice and convention by four members a disapprobation of the convention by the remaining three and further a disapprobation of the armistice by one of those three <\s>
<s> now it may be observed first that even if the investigation had not been a public one it might have reasonably been concluded from the circumstance of the board having omitted to report any opinion concerning the terms of the armistice and the convention that those terms had not occupied enough of its attention to justify the board in giving any opinion upon them whether of approbation or disapprobation and secondly this conclusion which might have been made ?priori is confirmed by the actual fact that no examination or inquiry of this kind appears throughout the report of its proceedings and therefore any opinion subsequently given in consequence of the requisition of the commander in chief can lay claim to no more authority upon these points than the opinion of the same men if they had never sat in a public court upon this question <\s>
<s> in this condition are all the members whether they approve or disapprove of the convention <\s>
<s> and with respect to the three who disapprove of the convention over and above the general impropriety of having under these circumstances pronounced a verdict at all in the character of members of that board they are subject to an especial charge of inconsistency in having given such an opinion in their second report as renders nugatory that which they first pronounced <\s>
<s> for the reason assigned in their first report for deeming no further military proceedings necessary is because it appears that unquestionable zeal and firmness were exhibited throughout by the several general officers and the reason assigned by those three who condemn the convention is that the generals did not insist upon the terms to which they were entitled that is in direct opposition to their former opinions the generals shewed a want of firmness and zeal <\s>
<s> if then the generals were acquitted in the first case solely upon the ground of having displayed firmness and zeal a confessed want of firmness and zeal in the second case implies conversely a ground of censure rendering in the opinions of these three members further military proceedings absolutely necessary <\s>
<s> they who are most aware of the unconstitutional frame of this court or board and of the perplexing situation in which its members must have found themselves placed will have the least difficulty in excusing this inconsistency it is however to be regretted particularly in the instance of the earl of moira who disapproving both of the convention and armistice has assigned for that disapprobation unanswerable reasons drawn not from hidden sources unapproachable except by judicial investigation but from facts known to all the world <\s>
<s> the reader will excuse this long note to which however i must add one word is it not strange that in the general decision of the board zeal and firmness nakedly considered and without question of their union with judgment and such other qualities as can alone give them any value should be assumed as sufficient grounds on which to rest the acquittal of men lying under a charge of military delinquency <\s>
<s> it is not necessary to add that one of these fears was removed by the actual landing of ten thousand men under sir j <\s>
<s> moore pending the negotiation and yet no change in the terms took place in consequence <\s>
<s> this was an important circumstance and of itself determined two of the members of the board of inquiry to disapprove of the convention such an accession entitling sir h <\s>
<s> dalrymple and of course making it his duty to insist on more favourable terms <\s>
<s> but the argument is complete without it <\s>
<s> i was unwilling to interrupt the reader upon a slight occasion but i cannot refrain from adding here a word or two by way of comment i have said at page 71 speaking of junot's army that the british were to encounter the same men c <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley before the board of inquiry disallowed this supposition affirming that junot's army had not then reached spain nor could be there for some time <\s>
<s> grant this was it not stipulated that a messenger should be sent off immediately after the conclusion of the treaty to buonaparte apprising him of its terms and when he might expect his troops and would not this enable him to hurry forward forces to the spanish frontiers and to bring them into action knowing that these troops of junot's would be ready to support him <\s>
<s> what did it matter whether the british were again to measure swords with these identical men whether these men were even to appear again upon spanish ground <\s>
<s> it was enough that if these did not others would who could not have been brought to that service but that these had been released and were doing elsewhere some other service for their master enough that every thing was provided by the british to land them as near the spanish frontier and as speedily as they could desire <\s>

<s> done and concluded at lisbon this 30th day of august 1808 <\s>
<s> to two of these questions viz <\s>
<s> those which relate to the particular armistice and convention made by the british generals the members of the board still persevering in their blindness to the other two which express doubt as to the lawfulness of any armistice or convention severally return answers which convey an approbation of the armistice and convention by four members a disapprobation of the convention by the remaining three and further a disapprobation of the armistice by one of those three <\s>
<s> now it may be observed first that even if the investigation had not been a public one it might have reasonably been concluded from the circumstance of the board having omitted to report any opinion concerning the terms of the armistice and the convention that those terms had not occupied enough of its attention to justify the board in giving any opinion upon them whether of approbation or disapprobation and secondly this conclusion which might have been made ?priori is confirmed by the actual fact that no examination or inquiry of this kind appears throughout the report of its proceedings and therefore any opinion subsequently given in consequence of the requisition of the commander in chief can lay claim to no more authority upon these points than the opinion of the same men if they had never sat in a public court upon this question <\s>
<s> in this condition are all the members whether they approve or disapprove of the convention <\s>
<s> and with respect to the three who disapprove of the convention over and above the general impropriety of having under these circumstances pronounced a verdict at all in the character of members of that board they are subject to an especial charge of inconsistency in having given such an opinion in their second report as renders nugatory that which they first pronounced <\s>
<s> for the reason assigned in their first report for deeming no further military proceedings necessary is because it appears that unquestionable zeal and firmness were exhibited throughout by the several general officers and the reason assigned by those three who condemn the convention is that the generals did not insist upon the terms to which they were entitled that is in direct opposition to their former opinions the generals shewed a want of firmness and zeal <\s>
<s> if then the generals were acquitted in the first case solely upon the ground of having displayed firmness and zeal a confessed want of firmness and zeal in the second case implies conversely a ground of censure rendering in the opinions of these three members further military proceedings absolutely necessary <\s>
<s> they who are most aware of the unconstitutional frame of this court or board and of the perplexing situation in which its members must have found themselves placed will have the least difficulty in excusing this inconsistency it is however to be regretted particularly in the instance of the earl of moira who disapproving both of the convention and armistice has assigned for that disapprobation unanswerable reasons drawn not from hidden sources unapproachable except by judicial investigation but from facts known to all the world <\s>
<s> the reader will excuse this long note to which however i must add one word is it not strange that in the general decision of the board zeal and firmness nakedly considered and without question of their union with judgment and such other qualities as can alone give them any value should be assumed as sufficient grounds on which to rest the acquittal of men lying under a charge of military delinquency <\s>
<s> it is not necessary to add that one of these fears was removed by the actual landing of ten thousand men under sir j <\s>
<s> moore pending the negotiation and yet no change in the terms took place in consequence <\s>
<s> this was an important circumstance and of itself determined two of the members of the board of inquiry to disapprove of the convention such an accession entitling sir h <\s>
<s> dalrymple and of course making it his duty to insist on more favourable terms <\s>
<s> but the argument is complete without it <\s>
<s> i was unwilling to interrupt the reader upon a slight occasion but i cannot refrain from adding here a word or two by way of comment i have said at page 71 speaking of junot's army that the british were to encounter the same men c <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley before the board of inquiry disallowed this supposition affirming that junot's army had not then reached spain nor could be there for some time <\s>
<s> grant this was it not stipulated that a messenger should be sent off immediately after the conclusion of the treaty to buonaparte apprising him of its terms and when he might expect his troops and would not this enable him to hurry forward forces to the spanish frontiers and to bring them into action knowing that these troops of junot's would be ready to support him <\s>
<s> what did it matter whether the british were again to measure swords with these identical men whether these men were even to appear again upon spanish ground <\s>
<s> it was enough that if these did not others would who could not have been brought to that service but that these had been released and were doing elsewhere some other service for their master enough that every thing was provided by the british to land them as near the spanish frontier and as speedily as they could desire <\s>

<s> done and concluded at lisbon this 30th day of august 1808 <\s>
<s> to two of these questions viz <\s>
<s> those which relate to the particular armistice and convention made by the british generals the members of the board still persevering in their blindness to the other two which express doubt as to the lawfulness of any armistice or convention severally return answers which convey an approbation of the armistice and convention by four members a disapprobation of the convention by the remaining three and further a disapprobation of the armistice by one of those three <\s>
<s> now it may be observed first that even if the investigation had not been a public one it might have reasonably been concluded from the circumstance of the board having omitted to report any opinion concerning the terms of the armistice and the convention that those terms had not occupied enough of its attention to justify the board in giving any opinion upon them whether of approbation or disapprobation and secondly this conclusion which might have been made ?priori is confirmed by the actual fact that no examination or inquiry of this kind appears throughout the report of its proceedings and therefore any opinion subsequently given in consequence of the requisition of the commander in chief can lay claim to no more authority upon these points than the opinion of the same men if they had never sat in a public court upon this question <\s>
<s> in this condition are all the members whether they approve or disapprove of the convention <\s>
<s> and with respect to the three who disapprove of the convention over and above the general impropriety of having under these circumstances pronounced a verdict at all in the character of members of that board they are subject to an especial charge of inconsistency in having given such an opinion in their second report as renders nugatory that which they first pronounced <\s>
<s> for the reason assigned in their first report for deeming no further military proceedings necessary is because it appears that unquestionable zeal and firmness were exhibited throughout by the several general officers and the reason assigned by those three who condemn the convention is that the generals did not insist upon the terms to which they were entitled that is in direct opposition to their former opinions the generals shewed a want of firmness and zeal <\s>
<s> if then the generals were acquitted in the first case solely upon the ground of having displayed firmness and zeal a confessed want of firmness and zeal in the second case implies conversely a ground of censure rendering in the opinions of these three members further military proceedings absolutely necessary <\s>
<s> they who are most aware of the unconstitutional frame of this court or board and of the perplexing situation in which its members must have found themselves placed will have the least difficulty in excusing this inconsistency it is however to be regretted particularly in the instance of the earl of moira who disapproving both of the convention and armistice has assigned for that disapprobation unanswerable reasons drawn not from hidden sources unapproachable except by judicial investigation but from facts known to all the world <\s>
<s> the reader will excuse this long note to which however i must add one word is it not strange that in the general decision of the board zeal and firmness nakedly considered and without question of their union with judgment and such other qualities as can alone give them any value should be assumed as sufficient grounds on which to rest the acquittal of men lying under a charge of military delinquency <\s>
<s> it is not necessary to add that one of these fears was removed by the actual landing of ten thousand men under sir j <\s>
<s> moore pending the negotiation and yet no change in the terms took place in consequence <\s>
<s> this was an important circumstance and of itself determined two of the members of the board of inquiry to disapprove of the convention such an accession entitling sir h <\s>
<s> dalrymple and of course making it his duty to insist on more favourable terms <\s>
<s> but the argument is complete without it <\s>
<s> i was unwilling to interrupt the reader upon a slight occasion but i cannot refrain from adding here a word or two by way of comment i have said at page 71 speaking of junot's army that the british were to encounter the same men c <\s>
<s> sir arthur wellesley before the board of inquiry disallowed this supposition affirming that junot's army had not then reached spain nor could be there for some time <\s>

<s> what did it matter whether the british were again to measure swords with these identical men whether these men were even to appear again upon spanish ground <\s>
<s> it was enough that if these did not others would who could not have been brought to that service but that these had been released and were doing elsewhere some other service for their master enough that every thing was provided by the british to land them as near the spanish frontier and as speedily as they could desire <\s>

<s> for the deplorable state of england and scotland at that time see the annals of charles the second and his successor we must not forget however that to this state of things as the cause of those measures which the nation afterwards resorted to we are originally indebted for the blessing of the bill of rights <\s>

<s> in this they were eminently assisted by the effects of their father's example his precepts and injunctions he was aware that truth speaking as a moral virtue is best secured by inculcating attention to accuracy of report even on trivial occasions and so rigid were the rules of honesty by which he endeavoured to bring up his family that if one of them had chanced to find in the lanes or fields anything of the least use or value without being able to ascertain to whom it belonged he always insisted upon the child's carrying it back to the place from which it had been brought <\s>

<s> that no common importance was attached to the observance of religious ordinances by his family appears from the following memorandum by one of his descendants which i am tempted to insert at length as it is characteristic and somewhat curious <\s>
<s> there is a small chapel in the county palatine of lancaster where a certain clergyman has regularly officiated above sixty years and a few months ago administered the sacrament of the lord's supper in the same to a decent number of devout communicants <\s>
<s> after the clergyman had received himself the first company out of the assembly who approached the altar and kneeled down to be partakers of the sacred elements consisted of the parson's wife to whom he had been married upwards of sixty years one son and his wife four daughters each with her husband whose ages all added together amount to above 714 years <\s>
<s> the several and respective distances from the place of each of their abodes to the chapel where they all communicated will measure more than 1000 english miles <\s>
<s> though the narration will appear surprising it is without doubt a fact that the same persons exactly four years before met at the same place and all joined in performance of the same venerable duty <\s>
<s> he was indeed most zealously attached to the doctrine and frame of the established church <\s>
<s> we have seen him congratulating himself that he had no dissenters in his cure of any denomination <\s>
<s> some allowance must be made for the state of opinion when his first religious impressions were received before the reader will acquit him of bigotry when i mention that at the time of the augmentation of the cure he refused to invest part of the money in the purchase of an estate offered to him upon advantageous terms because the proprietor was a quaker whether from scrupulous apprehension that a blessing would not attend a contract framed for the benefit of the church between persons not in religious sympathy with each other or as a seeker of peace he was afraid of the uncomplying disposition which at one time was too frequently conspicuous in that sect <\s>
<s> of this an instance had fallen under his own notice for while he taught school at loweswater certain persons of that denomination had refused to pay annual interest due under the title of church stock ;[ 2 a great hardship upon the incumbent for the curacy of loweswater was then scarcely less poor than that of seathwaite <\s>
<s> to what degree this prejudice of his was blameable need not be determined certain it is that he was not only desirous as he himself says to live in peace but in love with all men <\s>
<s> he was placable and charitable in his judgments and however correct in conduct and rigorous to himself he was ever ready to forgive the trespasses of others and to soften the censure that was cast upon their frailties it would be unpardonable to omit that in the maintenance of his virtues he received due support from the partner of his long life <\s>
<s> she was equally strict in attending to her share of their joint cares nor less diligent in her appropriate occupations <\s>
<s> a person who had been some time their servant in the latter part of their lives concluded the panegyric of her mistress by saying to me she was no less excellent than her husband she was good to the poor she was good to every thing <\s>
<s> he survived for a short time this virtuous companion <\s>
<s> when she died he ordered that her body should be borne to the grave by three of her daughters and one grand daughter and when the corpse was lifted from the threshold he insisted upon lending his aid and feeling about for he was then almost blind took hold of a napkin fixed to the coffin and as a bearer of the body entered the chapel a few steps from the lowly parsonage <\s>
<s> walker's charity being of that kind which seeketh not her own he would rather forego his rights than distrain for dues which the parties liable refused as a point of conscience to pay <\s>

<s> we have been dwelling upon images of peace in the moral world that have brought us again to the quiet enclosure of consecrated ground in which this venerable pair lie interred <\s>
<s> the sounding brook that rolls close by the churchyard without disturbing feeling or meditation is now unfortunately laid bare but not long ago it participated with the chapel the shade of some stately ash trees which will not spring again <\s>
<s> while the spectator from this spot is looking round upon the girdle of stony mountains that encompasses the vale masses of rock out of which monuments for all men that ever existed might have been hewn it would surprise him to be told as with truth he might be that the plain blue slab dedicated to the memory of this aged pair is a production of a quarry in north wales <\s>
<s> it was sent as a mark of respect by one of their descendants from the vale of festiniog a region almost as beautiful as that in which it now lies <\s>
<s> upon the seathwaite brook at a small distance from the parsonage has been erected a mill for spinning yarn it is a mean and disagreeable object though not unimportant to the spectator as calling to mind the momentous changes wrought by such inventions in the frame of society changes which have proved especially unfavourable to these mountain solitudes <\s>
<s> so much had been effected by those new powers before the subject of the preceding biographical sketch closed his life that their operation could not escape his notice and doubtless excited touching reflections upon the comparatively insignificant results of his own manual industry <\s>

<s> in this they were eminently assisted by the effects of their father's example his precepts and injunctions he was aware that truth speaking as a moral virtue is best secured by inculcating attention to accuracy of report even on trivial occasions and so rigid were the rules of honesty by which he endeavoured to bring up his family that if one of them had chanced to find in the lanes or fields anything of the least use or value without being able to ascertain to whom it belonged he always insisted upon the child's carrying it back to the place from which it had been brought <\s>

<s> nor could such conduct fail to remind those who witnessed it of a spirit nobler than law or custom they felt convictions which but for such intercourse could not have been afforded that as in the practice of their pastor there was no guile so in his faith there was nothing hollow and we are warranted in believing that upon these occasions selfishness obstinacy and discord would often give way before the breathings of his good will and saintly integrity <\s>
<s> it may be presumed also while his humble congregation were listening to the moral precepts which he delivered from the pulpit and to the christian exhortations that they should love their neighbours as themselves and do as they would be done unto that peculiar efficacy was given to the preacher's labours by recollections in the minds of his congregation that they were called upon to do no more than his own actions were daily setting before their eyes <\s>
<s> the afternoon service in the chapel was less numerously attended than that of the morning but by a more serious auditory the lesson from the new testament on those occasions was accompanied by burkitt's commentaries <\s>

<s> his devotional feelings and the powers of his own mind were further exercised along with those of his family in perusing the scriptures not only on the sunday evenings but on every other evening while the rest of the household were at work some one of the children and in her turn the servant for the sake of practice in reading or for instruction read the bible aloud and in this manner the whole was repeatedly gone through <\s>
<s> that no common importance was attached to the observance of religious ordinances by his family appears from the following memorandum by one of his descendants which i am tempted to insert at length as it is characteristic and somewhat curious <\s>
<s> there is a small chapel in the county palatine of lancaster where a certain clergyman has regularly officiated above sixty years and a few months ago administered the sacrament of the lord's supper in the same to a decent number of devout communicants <\s>
<s> after the clergyman had received himself the first company out of the assembly who approached the altar and kneeled down to be partakers of the sacred elements consisted of the parson's wife to whom he had been married upwards of sixty years one son and his wife four daughters each with her husband whose ages all added together amount to above 714 years <\s>
<s> the several and respective distances from the place of each of their abodes to the chapel where they all communicated will measure more than 1000 english miles <\s>
<s> though the narration will appear surprising it is without doubt a fact that the same persons exactly four years before met at the same place and all joined in performance of the same venerable duty <\s>
<s> he was indeed most zealously attached to the doctrine and frame of the established church <\s>
<s> we have seen him congratulating himself that he had no dissenters in his cure of any denomination <\s>
<s> some allowance must be made for the state of opinion when his first religious impressions were received before the reader will acquit him of bigotry when i mention that at the time of the augmentation of the cure he refused to invest part of the money in the purchase of an estate offered to him upon advantageous terms because the proprietor was a quaker whether from scrupulous apprehension that a blessing would not attend a contract framed for the benefit of the church between persons not in religious sympathy with each other or as a seeker of peace he was afraid of the uncomplying disposition which at one time was too frequently conspicuous in that sect <\s>
<s> of this an instance had fallen under his own notice for while he taught school at loweswater certain persons of that denomination had refused to pay annual interest due under the title of church stock ;[ 2 a great hardship upon the incumbent for the curacy of loweswater was then scarcely less poor than that of seathwaite <\s>
<s> to what degree this prejudice of his was blameable need not be determined certain it is that he was not only desirous as he himself says to live in peace but in love with all men <\s>
<s> he was placable and charitable in his judgments and however correct in conduct and rigorous to himself he was ever ready to forgive the trespasses of others and to soften the censure that was cast upon their frailties it would be unpardonable to omit that in the maintenance of his virtues he received due support from the partner of his long life <\s>
<s> she was equally strict in attending to her share of their joint cares nor less diligent in her appropriate occupations <\s>
<s> a person who had been some time their servant in the latter part of their lives concluded the panegyric of her mistress by saying to me she was no less excellent than her husband she was good to the poor she was good to every thing <\s>
<s> he survived for a short time this virtuous companion <\s>
<s> when she died he ordered that her body should be borne to the grave by three of her daughters and one grand daughter and when the corpse was lifted from the threshold he insisted upon lending his aid and feeling about for he was then almost blind took hold of a napkin fixed to the coffin and as a bearer of the body entered the chapel a few steps from the lowly parsonage <\s>
<s> walker's charity being of that kind which seeketh not her own he would rather forego his rights than distrain for dues which the parties liable refused as a point of conscience to pay <\s>

<s> his devotional feelings and the powers of his own mind were further exercised along with those of his family in perusing the scriptures not only on the sunday evenings but on every other evening while the rest of the household were at work some one of the children and in her turn the servant for the sake of practice in reading or for instruction read the bible aloud and in this manner the whole was repeatedly gone through <\s>
<s> that no common importance was attached to the observance of religious ordinances by his family appears from the following memorandum by one of his descendants which i am tempted to insert at length as it is characteristic and somewhat curious <\s>
<s> there is a small chapel in the county palatine of lancaster where a certain clergyman has regularly officiated above sixty years and a few months ago administered the sacrament of the lord's supper in the same to a decent number of devout communicants <\s>
<s> after the clergyman had received himself the first company out of the assembly who approached the altar and kneeled down to be partakers of the sacred elements consisted of the parson's wife to whom he had been married upwards of sixty years one son and his wife four daughters each with her husband whose ages all added together amount to above 714 years <\s>
<s> the several and respective distances from the place of each of their abodes to the chapel where they all communicated will measure more than 1000 english miles <\s>
<s> though the narration will appear surprising it is without doubt a fact that the same persons exactly four years before met at the same place and all joined in performance of the same venerable duty <\s>
<s> he was indeed most zealously attached to the doctrine and frame of the established church <\s>
<s> we have seen him congratulating himself that he had no dissenters in his cure of any denomination <\s>
<s> some allowance must be made for the state of opinion when his first religious impressions were received before the reader will acquit him of bigotry when i mention that at the time of the augmentation of the cure he refused to invest part of the money in the purchase of an estate offered to him upon advantageous terms because the proprietor was a quaker whether from scrupulous apprehension that a blessing would not attend a contract framed for the benefit of the church between persons not in religious sympathy with each other or as a seeker of peace he was afraid of the uncomplying disposition which at one time was too frequently conspicuous in that sect <\s>
<s> of this an instance had fallen under his own notice for while he taught school at loweswater certain persons of that denomination had refused to pay annual interest due under the title of church stock ;[ 2 a great hardship upon the incumbent for the curacy of loweswater was then scarcely less poor than that of seathwaite <\s>
<s> to what degree this prejudice of his was blameable need not be determined certain it is that he was not only desirous as he himself says to live in peace but in love with all men <\s>
<s> he was placable and charitable in his judgments and however correct in conduct and rigorous to himself he was ever ready to forgive the trespasses of others and to soften the censure that was cast upon their frailties it would be unpardonable to omit that in the maintenance of his virtues he received due support from the partner of his long life <\s>
<s> she was equally strict in attending to her share of their joint cares nor less diligent in her appropriate occupations <\s>
<s> a person who had been some time their servant in the latter part of their lives concluded the panegyric of her mistress by saying to me she was no less excellent than her husband she was good to the poor she was good to every thing <\s>
<s> he survived for a short time this virtuous companion <\s>
<s> when she died he ordered that her body should be borne to the grave by three of her daughters and one grand daughter and when the corpse was lifted from the threshold he insisted upon lending his aid and feeling about for he was then almost blind took hold of a napkin fixed to the coffin and as a bearer of the body entered the chapel a few steps from the lowly parsonage <\s>
<s> walker's charity being of that kind which seeketh not her own he would rather forego his rights than distrain for dues which the parties liable refused as a point of conscience to pay <\s>
<s> what a contrast does the life of this obscurely seated and in point of worldly wealth poorly repaid churchman present to that of a cardinal wolsey <\s>
<s> o tis a burthen cromwell tis a burthen too heavy for a man who hopes for heaven <\s>
<s> we have been dwelling upon images of peace in the moral world that have brought us again to the quiet enclosure of consecrated ground in which this venerable pair lie interred <\s>
<s> the sounding brook that rolls close by the churchyard without disturbing feeling or meditation is now unfortunately laid bare but not long ago it participated with the chapel the shade of some stately ash trees which will not spring again <\s>
<s> while the spectator from this spot is looking round upon the girdle of stony mountains that encompasses the vale masses of rock out of which monuments for all men that ever existed might have been hewn it would surprise him to be told as with truth he might be that the plain blue slab dedicated to the memory of this aged pair is a production of a quarry in north wales <\s>
<s> it was sent as a mark of respect by one of their descendants from the vale of festiniog a region almost as beautiful as that in which it now lies <\s>
<s> upon the seathwaite brook at a small distance from the parsonage has been erected a mill for spinning yarn it is a mean and disagreeable object though not unimportant to the spectator as calling to mind the momentous changes wrought by such inventions in the frame of society changes which have proved especially unfavourable to these mountain solitudes <\s>
<s> so much had been effected by those new powers before the subject of the preceding biographical sketch closed his life that their operation could not escape his notice and doubtless excited touching reflections upon the comparatively insignificant results of his own manual industry <\s>
<s> but robert walker was not a man of times and circumstances had he lived at a later period the principle of duty would have produced application as unremitting the same energy of character would have been displayed though in many instances with widely different effects <\s>
<s> with pleasure i annex as illustrative and confirmatory of the above account extracts from a paper in the christian remembrancer october 1819 it bears an assumed signature but is known to be the work of the rev <\s>
<s> bobert bamford vicar of bishopton in the county of durham a great grandson of mr <\s>
<s> walker whose worth it commemorates by a record not the less valuable for being written in very early youth <\s>
<s> his house was a nursery of virtue <\s>
<s> all the inmates were industrious and cleanly and happy <\s>
<s> sobriety neatness quietness characterised the whole family <\s>
<s> no railings no idleness no indulgence of passion were permitted <\s>
<s> every child ever young had its appointed engagements every hand was busy <\s>
<s> knitting spinning reading writing mending clothes making shoes were by the different children constantly performing <\s>
<s> the father himself sitting amongst them and guiding their thoughts was engaged in the same occupations .... <\s>
<s> he sate up late and rose early when the family were at rest he retired to a little room which he had built on the roof of his house <\s>
<s> he had slated it and fitted it up with shelves for his books his stock of cloth wearing apparel and his utensils <\s>
<s> there many a cold winter's night without fire while the roof was glazed with ice did he remain reading or writing till the day dawned <\s>
<s> he taught the children in the chapel for there was no schoolhouse <\s>
<s> yet in that cold damp place he never had a fire <\s>
<s> he used to send the children in parties either to his own fire at home or make them run up the mountain side <\s>
<s> it may be further mentioned that he was a passionate admirer of nature she was his mother and he was a dutiful child <\s>
<s> while engaged on the mountains it was his greatest pleasure to view the rising sun and in tranquil evenings as it slided behind the hills he blessed its departure <\s>
<s> he was skilled in fossils and plants a constant observer of the stars and winds the atmosphere was his delight <\s>
<s> he made many experiments on its nature and properties <\s>
<s> in summer he used to gather a multitude of flies and insects and by his entertaining description amuse and instruct his children <\s>
<s> they shared all his daily employments and derived many sentiments of love and benevolence from his observations on the works and productions of nature <\s>
<s> whether they were following him in the field or surrounding him in school he took every opportunity of storing their minds with useful information nor was the circle of his influence confined to seathwaite <\s>
<s> many a distant mother has told her child of mr <\s>

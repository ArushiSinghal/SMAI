<s> first we note lying to the south east the vale of langdale 50 which will conduct the eye to the long lake of winandermere stretched nearly to the sea or rather to the sands of the vast bay of morcamb serving here for the rim of this imaginary wheel let us trace it in a direction from the south east towards the south and we shall next fix our eyes upon the vale of coniston running up likewise from the sea but not as all the other vallies do to the nave of the wheel and therefore it may be not inaptly represented as a broken spoke sticking in the rim <\s>
<s> looking forth again with an inclination towards the west we see immediately at our feet the vale of duddon in which is no lake but a copious stream winding among fields rocks and mountains and terminating its course in the sands of duddon <\s>

<s> its stream passes under the woody steep upon which stands muncaster castle the ancient seat of the penningtons and after forming a short and narrow aestuary enters the sea below the small town of ravenglass <\s>

<s> beyond this little fertile plain lies within a bed of steep mountains the long narrow stern and desolate lake of wastdale and beyond this a dusky tract of level ground conducts the eye to the irish sea <\s>

<s> lastly borrowdale of which the vale of keswick is only a continuation stretching due north brings us to a point nearly opposite to the vale of winandermere with which we began <\s>
<s> from this it will appear that the image of a wheel thus far exact is little more than one half complete but the deficiency on the eastern side may be supplied by the vales of wytheburn ulswater hawswater and the vale of grasmere and rydal none of these however run up to the central point between great gavel and scawfell <\s>

<s> 50 anciently spelt langden and so called by the old inhabitants to this day dean from which the latter part of the word is derived being in many parts of england a name for a valley <\s>
<s> such concisely given is the general topographical view of the country of the lakes in the north of england and it may be observed that from the circumference to the centre that is from the sea or plain country to the mountain stations specified there is in the several ridges that enclose these vales and divide them from each other i mean in the forms and surfaces first of the swelling grounds next of the hills and rocks and lastly of the mountains an ascent of almost regular gradation from elegance and richness to their highest point of grandeur and sublimity <\s>
<s> it follows therefore from this first that these rocks hills and mountains must present themselves to view in stages rising above each other the mountains clustering together towards the central point and next that an observer familiar with the several vales must from their various position in relation to the sun have had before his eyes every possible embellishment of beauty dignity and splendour which light and shadow can bestow upon objects so diversified <\s>
<s> for example in the vale of winandermere if the spectator looks for gentle and lovely scenes his eye is turned towards the south if for the grand towards the north in the vale of keswick which as hath been said lies almost due north of this it is directly the reverse <\s>
<s> hence when the sun is setting in summer far to the north west it is seen by the spectator from the shores or breast of winandermere resting among the summits of the loftiest mountains some of which will perhaps be half or wholly hidden by clouds or by the blaze of light which the orb diffuses around it and the surface of the lake will reflect before the eye correspondent colours through every variety of beauty and through all degrees of splendour <\s>
<s> in the vale of keswick at the same period the sun sets over the humbler regions of the landscape and showers down upon them the radiance which at once veils and glorifies sending forth meanwhile broad streams of rosy crimson purple or golden light towards the grand mountains in the south and south east which thus illuminated with all their projections and cavities and with an intermixture of solemn shadows are seen distinctly through a cool and clear atmosphere <\s>
<s> of course there is as marked a difference between the noontide appearance of these two opposite vales <\s>
<s> the bedimming haze that overspreads the south and the clear atmosphere and determined shadows of the clouds in the north at the same time of the day are each seen in these several vales with a contrast as striking <\s>
<s> the reader will easily conceive in what degree the intermediate vales partake of a kindred variety <\s>
<s> i do not indeed know any tract of country in which within so narrow a compass may be found an equal variety in the influences of light and shadow upon the sublime or beautiful features of landscape and it is owing to the combined circumstances to which the reader's attention has been directed <\s>
<s> from a point between great gavel and scawfell a shepherd would not require more than an hour to descend into any one of eight of the principal vales by which he would be surrounded and all the others lie with the exception of hawswater at but a small distance <\s>
<s> yet though clustered together every valley has its distinct and separate character in some instances as if they had been formed in studied contrast to each other and in others with the united pleasing differences and resemblances of a sisterly rivalship <\s>
<s> this concentration of interest gives to the country a decided superiority over the most attractive districts of scotland and wales especially for the pedestrian traveller <\s>
<s> in scotland and wales are found undoubtedly individual scenes which in their several kinds cannot be excelled <\s>
<s> but in scotland particularly what long tracts of desolate country intervene <\s>
<s> so that the traveller when he reaches a spot deservedly of great celebrity would find it difficult to determine how much of his pleasure is owing to excellence inherent in the landscape itself and how much to an instantaneous recovery from an oppression left upon his spirits by the barrenness and desolation through which he has passed <\s>
<s> but to proceed with our survey and first of the mountains <\s>
<s> their forms are endlessly diversified sweeping easily or boldly in simple majesty abrupt and precipitous or soft and elegant <\s>
<s> in magnitude and grandeur they are individually inferior to the most celebrated of those in some other parts of this island but in the combinations which they make towering above each other or lifting themselves in ridges like the waves of a tumultuous sea and in the beauty and variety of their surfaces and colours they are surpassed by none <\s>
<s> the general surface of the mountains is turf rendered rich and green by the moisture of the climate <\s>
<s> sometimes the turf as in the neighbourhood of newlands is little broken the whole covering being soft and downy pasturage <\s>
<s> in other places rocks predominate the soil is laid bare by torrents and burstings of water from the sides of the mountains in heavy rains and not unfrequently their perpendicular sides are seamed by ravines formed also by rains and torrents which meeting in angular points entrench and scar the surface with numerous figures like the letters w <\s>
<s> in the ridge that divides eskdale from wasdale granite is found but the mountains are for the most part composed of the stone by mineralogists termed schist which as you approach the plain country gives place to limestone and freestone but schist being the substance of the mountains the predominant colour of their rocky parts is bluish or hoary grey the general tint of the lichens with which the bare stone is encrusted <\s>
<s> with this blue or grey colour is frequently intermixed a red tinge proceeding from the iron that interveins the stone and impregnates the soil <\s>
<s> the iron is the principle of decomposition in these rocks and hence when they become pulverized the elementary particles crumbling down overspread in many places the steep and almost precipitous sides of the mountains with an intermixture of colours like the compound hues of a dove's neck <\s>
<s> when in the heat of advancing summer the fresh green tint of the herbage has somewhat faded it is again revived by the appearance of the fern profusely spread over the same ground and upon this plant more than upon anything else do the changes which the seasons make in the colouring of the mountains depend <\s>
<s> about the first week in october the rich green which prevailed through the whole summer is usually passed away <\s>
<s> the brilliant and various colours of the fern are then in harmony with the autumnal woods bright yellow or lemon colour at the base of the mountains melting gradually through orange to a dark russet brown towards the summits where the plant being more exposed to the weather is in a more advanced state of decay <\s>
<s> neither heath nor furze are generally found upon the sides of these mountains though in many places they are adorned by those plants so beautiful when in flower <\s>
<s> we may add that the mountains are of height sufficient to have the surface towards the summit softened by distance and to imbibe the finest aërial hues <\s>
<s> in common also with other mountains their apparent forms and colours are perpetually changed by the clouds and vapours which float round them the effect indeed of mist or haze in a country of this character is like that of magic <\s>
<s> i have seen six or seven ridges rising above each other all created in a moment by the vapours upon the side of a mountain which in its ordinary appearance shewed not a projecting point to furnish even a hint for such an operation <\s>
<s> i will take this opportunity of observing that they who have studied the appearances of nature feel that the superiority in point of visual interest of mountainous over other countries is more strikingly displayed in winter than in summer <\s>
<s> this as must be obvious is partly owing to the forms of the mountains which of course are not affected by the seasons but also in no small degree to the greater variety that exists in their winter than their summer colouring <\s>
<s> this variety is such and so harmoniously preserved that it leaves little cause of regret when the splendour of autumn is passed away <\s>
<s> the oak coppices upon the sides of the mountains retain russet leaves the birch stands conspicuous with its silver stem and puce coloured twigs the hollies with green leaves and scarlet berries have come forth to view from among the deciduous trees whose summer foliage had concealed them the ivy is now plentifully apparent upon the stems and boughs of the trees and upon the steep rocks <\s>
<s> in place of the deep summer green of the herbage and fern many rich colours play into each other over the surface of the mountains turf the tints of which are interchangeably tawny green olive and brown beds of withered fern and grey rocks being harmoniously blended together <\s>
<s> the mosses and lichens are never so fresh and flourishing as in winter if it be not a season of frost and their minute beauties prodigally adorn the foreground <\s>
<s> wherever we turn we find these productions of nature to which winter is rather favourable than unkindly scattered over the walls banks of earth rocks and stones and upon the trunks of trees with the intermixture of several species of small fern now green and fresh and to the observing passenger their forms and colours are a source of inexhaustable admiration <\s>
<s> add to this the hoar frost and snow with all the varieties they create and which volumes would not be sufficient to describe <\s>
<s> i will content myself with one instance of the colouring produced by snow which may not be uninteresting to painters <\s>
<s> it is extracted from the memorandum book of a friend and for its accuracy i can speak having been an eye witness of the appearance <\s>
<s> i observed says he the beautiful effect of the drifted snow upon the mountains and the perfect tone of colour <\s>
<s> from the top of the mountains downwards a rich olive was produced by the powdery snow and the grass which olive was warmed with a little brown and in this way harmoniously combined by insensible gradations with the white <\s>
<s> the drifting took away the monotony of snow and the whole vale of grasmere seen from the terrace walk in easedale was as varied perhaps more so than even in the pomp of autumn <\s>
<s> in the distance was loughrigg fell the basin wall of the lake this from the summit downward was a rich orange olive then the lake of a bright olive green nearly the same tint as the snow powdered mountain tops and high slopes in easedale and lastly the church with its firs forming the centre of the view <\s>
<s> next to the church came nine distinguishable hills six of them with woody sides turned towards us all of them oak copses with their bright red leaves and snow powdered twigs these hills so variously situated in relation to each other and to the view in general so variously powdered some only enough to give the herbage a rich brown tint one intensely white and lighting up all the others were yet so placed as in the most inobtrusive manner to harmonise by contrast with a perfect naked snowless bleak summit in the far distance <\s>
<s> having spoken of the forms surface and colour of the mountains let us descend into the vales <\s>
<s> though these have been represented under the general image of the spokes of a wheel they are for the most part winding the windings of many being abrupt and intricate <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that in one circumstance the general shape of them all has been determined by that primitive conformation through which so many became receptacles of lakes <\s>
<s> for they are not formed as are most of the celebrated welsh vallies by an approximation of the sloping bases of the opposite mountains towards each other leaving little more between than a channel for the passage of a hasty river but the bottom of these vallies is mostly a spacious and gently declining area apparently level as the floor of a temple or the surface of a lake and broken in many cases by rocks and hills which rise up like islands from the plain <\s>
<s> in such of the vallies as make many windings these level areas open upon the traveller in succession divided from each other sometimes by a mutual approximation of the hills leaving only passage for a river sometimes by correspondent windings without such approximation and sometimes by a bold advance of one mountain towards that which is opposite it <\s>
<s> it may here be observed with propriety that the several rocks and hills which have been described as rising up like islands from the level area of the vale have regulated the choice of the inhabitants in the situation of their dwellings <\s>
<s> where none of these are found and the inclination of the ground is not sufficiently rapid easily to carry off the waters as in the higher part of langdale for instance the houses are not sprinkled over the middle of the vales but confined to their sides being placed merely so far up the mountain as to be protected from the floods <\s>
<s> but where these rocks and hills have been scattered over the plain of the vale as in grasmere donnerdale eskdale c the beauty which they give to the scene is much heightened by a single cottage or cluster of cottages that will be almost always found under them or upon their sides dryness and shelter having tempted the dalesmen to fix their habitations there <\s>
<s> i shall now speak of the lakes of this country <\s>
<s> the form of the lake is most perfect when like derwent water and some of the smaller lakes it least resembles that of a river i mean when being looked at from any given point where the whole may be seen at once the width of it bears such proportion to the length that however the outline may be diversified by far receding bays it never assumes the shape of a river and is contemplated with that placid and quiet feeling which belongs peculiarly to the lake as a body of still water under the influence of no current reflecting therefore the clouds the light and all the imagery of the sky and surrounding hills expressing also and making visible the changes of the atmosphere and motions of the lightest breeze and subject to agitation only from the winds the visible scene would enter unawares into his mind with all its solemn imagery its rocks its woods and that uncertain heaven received into the bosom of the steady lake <\s>
<s> it must be noticed as a favourable characteristic of the lakes of this country that though several of the largest such as winandermere ulswater hawswater do when the whole length of them is commanded from an elevated point loose somewhat of the peculiar form of the lake and assume the resemblance of a magnificent river yet as their shape is winding particularly that of ulswater and hawswater when the view of the whole is obstructed by those barriers which determine the windings and the spectator is confined to one reach the appropriate feeling is revived and one lake may thus in succession present to the eye the essential characteristic of many <\s>
<s> but though the forms of the large lakes have this advantage it is nevertheless favourable to the beauty of the country that the largest of them are comparatively small and that the same vale generally furnishes a succession of lakes instead of being filled with one <\s>
<s> the vales in north wales as hath been observed are not formed for the reception of lakes those of switzerland scotland and this part of the north of england are so formed but in switzerland and scotland the proportion of diffused water is often too great as at the lake of geneva for instance and in most of the scotch lakes <\s>
<s> no doubt it sounds magnificent and flatters the imagination to hear at a distance of expanses of water so many leagues in length and miles in width and such ample room may be delightful to the fresh water sailor scudding with a lively breeze amid the rapidly shifting scenery <\s>
<s> but who ever travelled along the banks of loch lomond variegated as the lower part is by islands without feeling that a speedier termination of the long vista of blank water would be acceptable and without wishing for an interposition of green meadows trees and cottages and a sparkling stream to run by his side <\s>
<s> in fact a notion of grandeur as connected with magnitude has seduced persons of taste into a general mistake upon this subject <\s>
<s> it is much more desirable for the purposes of pleasure that lakes should be numerous and small or middle sized than large not only for communication by walks and rides but for variety and for recurrence of similar appearances <\s>
<s> to illustrate this by one instance how pleasing is it to have a ready and frequent opportunity of watching at the outlet of a lake the stream pushing its way among the rocks in lively contrast with the stillness from which it has escaped and how amusing to compare its noisy and turbulent motions with the gentle playfulness of the breezes that may be starting up or wandering here and there over the faintly rippled surface of the broad water <\s>
<s> i may add as a general remark that in lakes of great width the shores cannot be distinctly seen at the same time and therefore contribute little to mutual illustration and ornament and if the opposite shores are out of sight of each other like those of the american and asiatic lakes then unfortunately the traveller is reminded of a nobler object he has the blankness of a sea prospect without the grandeur and accompanying sense of power <\s>
<s> as the comparatively small size of the lakes in the north of england is favourable to the production of variegated landscape their boundary line also is for the most part gracefully or boldly indented <\s>
<s> that uniformity which prevails in the primitive frame of the lower grounds among all chains or clusters of mountains where large bodies of still water are bedded is broken by the secondary agents of nature ever at work to supply the deficiences of the mould in which things were originally cast <\s>
<s> using the word deficiences i do not speak with reference to those stronger emotions which a region of mountains is peculiarly fitted to excite <\s>
<s> the bases of those huge barriers may run for a long space in straight lines and these parallel to each other the opposite sides of a profound vale may ascend as exact counterparts or in mutual reflection like the billows of a troubled sea and the impression be from its very simplicity more awful and sublime <\s>
<s> sublimity is the result of nature's first great dealings with the superficies of the earth but the general tendency of her subsequent operations is towards the production of beauty by a multiplicity of symmetrical parts uniting in a consistent whole <\s>
<s> this is everywhere exemplified along the margins of these lakes <\s>
<s> the top of it which is only a few steps on the south side affords the best view of the vale which is to be had by a traveller who confines himself to the public road <\s>

<s> i shall now speak of the lakes of this country <\s>
<s> the form of the lake is most perfect when like derwent water and some of the smaller lakes it least resembles that of a river i mean when being looked at from any given point where the whole may be seen at once the width of it bears such proportion to the length that however the outline may be diversified by far receding bays it never assumes the shape of a river and is contemplated with that placid and quiet feeling which belongs peculiarly to the lake as a body of still water under the influence of no current reflecting therefore the clouds the light and all the imagery of the sky and surrounding hills expressing also and making visible the changes of the atmosphere and motions of the lightest breeze and subject to agitation only from the winds the visible scene would enter unawares into his mind with all its solemn imagery its rocks its woods and that uncertain heaven received into the bosom of the steady lake <\s>
<s> it must be noticed as a favourable characteristic of the lakes of this country that though several of the largest such as winandermere ulswater hawswater do when the whole length of them is commanded from an elevated point loose somewhat of the peculiar form of the lake and assume the resemblance of a magnificent river yet as their shape is winding particularly that of ulswater and hawswater when the view of the whole is obstructed by those barriers which determine the windings and the spectator is confined to one reach the appropriate feeling is revived and one lake may thus in succession present to the eye the essential characteristic of many <\s>
<s> but though the forms of the large lakes have this advantage it is nevertheless favourable to the beauty of the country that the largest of them are comparatively small and that the same vale generally furnishes a succession of lakes instead of being filled with one <\s>
<s> the vales in north wales as hath been observed are not formed for the reception of lakes those of switzerland scotland and this part of the north of england are so formed but in switzerland and scotland the proportion of diffused water is often too great as at the lake of geneva for instance and in most of the scotch lakes <\s>
<s> no doubt it sounds magnificent and flatters the imagination to hear at a distance of expanses of water so many leagues in length and miles in width and such ample room may be delightful to the fresh water sailor scudding with a lively breeze amid the rapidly shifting scenery <\s>
<s> but who ever travelled along the banks of loch lomond variegated as the lower part is by islands without feeling that a speedier termination of the long vista of blank water would be acceptable and without wishing for an interposition of green meadows trees and cottages and a sparkling stream to run by his side <\s>
<s> in fact a notion of grandeur as connected with magnitude has seduced persons of taste into a general mistake upon this subject <\s>
<s> it is much more desirable for the purposes of pleasure that lakes should be numerous and small or middle sized than large not only for communication by walks and rides but for variety and for recurrence of similar appearances <\s>
<s> to illustrate this by one instance how pleasing is it to have a ready and frequent opportunity of watching at the outlet of a lake the stream pushing its way among the rocks in lively contrast with the stillness from which it has escaped and how amusing to compare its noisy and turbulent motions with the gentle playfulness of the breezes that may be starting up or wandering here and there over the faintly rippled surface of the broad water <\s>
<s> i may add as a general remark that in lakes of great width the shores cannot be distinctly seen at the same time and therefore contribute little to mutual illustration and ornament and if the opposite shores are out of sight of each other like those of the american and asiatic lakes then unfortunately the traveller is reminded of a nobler object he has the blankness of a sea prospect without the grandeur and accompanying sense of power <\s>
<s> as the comparatively small size of the lakes in the north of england is favourable to the production of variegated landscape their boundary line also is for the most part gracefully or boldly indented <\s>

<s> it is hoped also that this essay may become generally serviceable by leading to habits of more exact and considerate observation than as far as the writer knows have hitherto been applied to local scenery <\s>
<s> to begin then with the main outlines of the country i know not how to give the reader a distinct image of these more readily than by requesting him to place himself with me in imagination upon some given point let it be the top of either of the mountains great gavel or scawfell or rather let us suppose our station to be a cloud hanging midway between those two mountains at not more than half a mile's distance from the summit of each and not many yards above their highest elevation we shall then see stretched at our feet a number of vallies not fewer than eight diverging from the point on which we are supposed to stand like spokes from the nave of a wheel <\s>
<s> first we note lying to the south east the vale of langdale 50 which will conduct the eye to the long lake of winandermere stretched nearly to the sea or rather to the sands of the vast bay of morcamb serving here for the rim of this imaginary wheel let us trace it in a direction from the south east towards the south and we shall next fix our eyes upon the vale of coniston running up likewise from the sea but not as all the other vallies do to the nave of the wheel and therefore it may be not inaptly represented as a broken spoke sticking in the rim <\s>
<s> looking forth again with an inclination towards the west we see immediately at our feet the vale of duddon in which is no lake but a copious stream winding among fields rocks and mountains and terminating its course in the sands of duddon <\s>
<s> the fourth vale next to be observed viz <\s>
<s> that of the esk is of the same general character as the last yet beautifully discriminated from it by peculiar features <\s>
<s> its stream passes under the woody steep upon which stands muncaster castle the ancient seat of the penningtons and after forming a short and narrow aestuary enters the sea below the small town of ravenglass <\s>
<s> next almost due west look down into and along the deep valley of wastdale with its little chapel and half a dozen neat dwellings scattered upon a plain of meadow and corn ground intersected with stone walls apparently innumerable like a large piece of lawless patch work or an array of mathematical figures such as in the ancient schools of geometry might have been sportively and fantastically traced out upon sand <\s>
<s> beyond this little fertile plain lies within a bed of steep mountains the long narrow stern and desolate lake of wastdale and beyond this a dusky tract of level ground conducts the eye to the irish sea <\s>
<s> the stream that issues from wast water is named the irt and falls into the aestuary of the river esk <\s>
<s> next comes in view ennerdale with its lake of bold and somewhat savage shores <\s>
<s> its stream the ehen or enna flowing through a soft and fertile country passes the town of egremont and the ruins of the castle then seeming like the other rivers to break through the barrier of sand thrown up by the winds on this tempestuous coast enters the irish sea <\s>
<s> the vale of buttermere with the lake and village of that name and crummock water beyond next present themselves <\s>
<s> we will follow the main stream the coker through the fertile and beautiful vale of lorton till it is lost in the derwent below the noble ruins of cockermouth castle <\s>
<s> lastly borrowdale of which the vale of keswick is only a continuation stretching due north brings us to a point nearly opposite to the vale of winandermere with which we began <\s>
<s> from this it will appear that the image of a wheel thus far exact is little more than one half complete but the deficiency on the eastern side may be supplied by the vales of wytheburn ulswater hawswater and the vale of grasmere and rydal none of these however run up to the central point between great gavel and scawfell <\s>
<s> from this hitherto our central point take a flight of not more than four or five miles eastward to the ridge of helvellyn and you will look down upon wytheburn and st <\s>
<s> john's vale which are a branch of the vale of keswick upon ulswater stretching due east and not far beyond to the south east though from this point not visible lie the vale and lake of hawswater and lastly the vale of grasmere rydal and ambleside brings you back to winandermere thus completing though on the eastern side in a somewhat irregular manner the representative figure of the wheel <\s>
<s> 50 anciently spelt langden and so called by the old inhabitants to this day dean from which the latter part of the word is derived being in many parts of england a name for a valley <\s>
<s> such concisely given is the general topographical view of the country of the lakes in the north of england and it may be observed that from the circumference to the centre that is from the sea or plain country to the mountain stations specified there is in the several ridges that enclose these vales and divide them from each other i mean in the forms and surfaces first of the swelling grounds next of the hills and rocks and lastly of the mountains an ascent of almost regular gradation from elegance and richness to their highest point of grandeur and sublimity <\s>
<s> it follows therefore from this first that these rocks hills and mountains must present themselves to view in stages rising above each other the mountains clustering together towards the central point and next that an observer familiar with the several vales must from their various position in relation to the sun have had before his eyes every possible embellishment of beauty dignity and splendour which light and shadow can bestow upon objects so diversified <\s>
<s> for example in the vale of winandermere if the spectator looks for gentle and lovely scenes his eye is turned towards the south if for the grand towards the north in the vale of keswick which as hath been said lies almost due north of this it is directly the reverse <\s>
<s> hence when the sun is setting in summer far to the north west it is seen by the spectator from the shores or breast of winandermere resting among the summits of the loftiest mountains some of which will perhaps be half or wholly hidden by clouds or by the blaze of light which the orb diffuses around it and the surface of the lake will reflect before the eye correspondent colours through every variety of beauty and through all degrees of splendour <\s>
<s> in the vale of keswick at the same period the sun sets over the humbler regions of the landscape and showers down upon them the radiance which at once veils and glorifies sending forth meanwhile broad streams of rosy crimson purple or golden light towards the grand mountains in the south and south east which thus illuminated with all their projections and cavities and with an intermixture of solemn shadows are seen distinctly through a cool and clear atmosphere <\s>
<s> of course there is as marked a difference between the noontide appearance of these two opposite vales <\s>
<s> the bedimming haze that overspreads the south and the clear atmosphere and determined shadows of the clouds in the north at the same time of the day are each seen in these several vales with a contrast as striking <\s>
<s> the reader will easily conceive in what degree the intermediate vales partake of a kindred variety <\s>
<s> i do not indeed know any tract of country in which within so narrow a compass may be found an equal variety in the influences of light and shadow upon the sublime or beautiful features of landscape and it is owing to the combined circumstances to which the reader's attention has been directed <\s>
<s> from a point between great gavel and scawfell a shepherd would not require more than an hour to descend into any one of eight of the principal vales by which he would be surrounded and all the others lie with the exception of hawswater at but a small distance <\s>
<s> yet though clustered together every valley has its distinct and separate character in some instances as if they had been formed in studied contrast to each other and in others with the united pleasing differences and resemblances of a sisterly rivalship <\s>
<s> this concentration of interest gives to the country a decided superiority over the most attractive districts of scotland and wales especially for the pedestrian traveller <\s>
<s> in scotland and wales are found undoubtedly individual scenes which in their several kinds cannot be excelled <\s>
<s> but in scotland particularly what long tracts of desolate country intervene <\s>
<s> so that the traveller when he reaches a spot deservedly of great celebrity would find it difficult to determine how much of his pleasure is owing to excellence inherent in the landscape itself and how much to an instantaneous recovery from an oppression left upon his spirits by the barrenness and desolation through which he has passed <\s>
<s> but to proceed with our survey and first of the mountains <\s>
<s> their forms are endlessly diversified sweeping easily or boldly in simple majesty abrupt and precipitous or soft and elegant <\s>
<s> in magnitude and grandeur they are individually inferior to the most celebrated of those in some other parts of this island but in the combinations which they make towering above each other or lifting themselves in ridges like the waves of a tumultuous sea and in the beauty and variety of their surfaces and colours they are surpassed by none <\s>
<s> the general surface of the mountains is turf rendered rich and green by the moisture of the climate <\s>
<s> sometimes the turf as in the neighbourhood of newlands is little broken the whole covering being soft and downy pasturage <\s>
<s> in other places rocks predominate the soil is laid bare by torrents and burstings of water from the sides of the mountains in heavy rains and not unfrequently their perpendicular sides are seamed by ravines formed also by rains and torrents which meeting in angular points entrench and scar the surface with numerous figures like the letters w <\s>
<s> in the ridge that divides eskdale from wasdale granite is found but the mountains are for the most part composed of the stone by mineralogists termed schist which as you approach the plain country gives place to limestone and freestone but schist being the substance of the mountains the predominant colour of their rocky parts is bluish or hoary grey the general tint of the lichens with which the bare stone is encrusted <\s>
<s> with this blue or grey colour is frequently intermixed a red tinge proceeding from the iron that interveins the stone and impregnates the soil <\s>
<s> the iron is the principle of decomposition in these rocks and hence when they become pulverized the elementary particles crumbling down overspread in many places the steep and almost precipitous sides of the mountains with an intermixture of colours like the compound hues of a dove's neck <\s>
<s> when in the heat of advancing summer the fresh green tint of the herbage has somewhat faded it is again revived by the appearance of the fern profusely spread over the same ground and upon this plant more than upon anything else do the changes which the seasons make in the colouring of the mountains depend <\s>
<s> about the first week in october the rich green which prevailed through the whole summer is usually passed away <\s>
<s> the brilliant and various colours of the fern are then in harmony with the autumnal woods bright yellow or lemon colour at the base of the mountains melting gradually through orange to a dark russet brown towards the summits where the plant being more exposed to the weather is in a more advanced state of decay <\s>
<s> neither heath nor furze are generally found upon the sides of these mountains though in many places they are adorned by those plants so beautiful when in flower <\s>
<s> we may add that the mountains are of height sufficient to have the surface towards the summit softened by distance and to imbibe the finest aërial hues <\s>
<s> in common also with other mountains their apparent forms and colours are perpetually changed by the clouds and vapours which float round them the effect indeed of mist or haze in a country of this character is like that of magic <\s>
<s> i have seen six or seven ridges rising above each other all created in a moment by the vapours upon the side of a mountain which in its ordinary appearance shewed not a projecting point to furnish even a hint for such an operation <\s>

<s> add to this the hoar frost and snow with all the varieties they create and which volumes would not be sufficient to describe <\s>

<s> the general surface of the mountains is turf rendered rich and green by the moisture of the climate <\s>
<s> sometimes the turf as in the neighbourhood of newlands is little broken the whole covering being soft and downy pasturage <\s>
<s> in other places rocks predominate the soil is laid bare by torrents and burstings of water from the sides of the mountains in heavy rains and not unfrequently their perpendicular sides are seamed by ravines formed also by rains and torrents which meeting in angular points entrench and scar the surface with numerous figures like the letters w <\s>
<s> in the ridge that divides eskdale from wasdale granite is found but the mountains are for the most part composed of the stone by mineralogists termed schist which as you approach the plain country gives place to limestone and freestone but schist being the substance of the mountains the predominant colour of their rocky parts is bluish or hoary grey the general tint of the lichens with which the bare stone is encrusted <\s>
<s> with this blue or grey colour is frequently intermixed a red tinge proceeding from the iron that interveins the stone and impregnates the soil <\s>
<s> the iron is the principle of decomposition in these rocks and hence when they become pulverized the elementary particles crumbling down overspread in many places the steep and almost precipitous sides of the mountains with an intermixture of colours like the compound hues of a dove's neck <\s>
<s> when in the heat of advancing summer the fresh green tint of the herbage has somewhat faded it is again revived by the appearance of the fern profusely spread over the same ground and upon this plant more than upon anything else do the changes which the seasons make in the colouring of the mountains depend <\s>
<s> about the first week in october the rich green which prevailed through the whole summer is usually passed away <\s>
<s> the brilliant and various colours of the fern are then in harmony with the autumnal woods bright yellow or lemon colour at the base of the mountains melting gradually through orange to a dark russet brown towards the summits where the plant being more exposed to the weather is in a more advanced state of decay <\s>
<s> neither heath nor furze are generally found upon the sides of these mountains though in many places they are adorned by those plants so beautiful when in flower <\s>
<s> we may add that the mountains are of height sufficient to have the surface towards the summit softened by distance and to imbibe the finest aërial hues <\s>
<s> in common also with other mountains their apparent forms and colours are perpetually changed by the clouds and vapours which float round them the effect indeed of mist or haze in a country of this character is like that of magic <\s>
<s> i have seen six or seven ridges rising above each other all created in a moment by the vapours upon the side of a mountain which in its ordinary appearance shewed not a projecting point to furnish even a hint for such an operation <\s>
<s> i will take this opportunity of observing that they who have studied the appearances of nature feel that the superiority in point of visual interest of mountainous over other countries is more strikingly displayed in winter than in summer <\s>
<s> this as must be obvious is partly owing to the forms of the mountains which of course are not affected by the seasons but also in no small degree to the greater variety that exists in their winter than their summer colouring <\s>
<s> this variety is such and so harmoniously preserved that it leaves little cause of regret when the splendour of autumn is passed away <\s>
<s> the oak coppices upon the sides of the mountains retain russet leaves the birch stands conspicuous with its silver stem and puce coloured twigs the hollies with green leaves and scarlet berries have come forth to view from among the deciduous trees whose summer foliage had concealed them the ivy is now plentifully apparent upon the stems and boughs of the trees and upon the steep rocks <\s>
<s> in place of the deep summer green of the herbage and fern many rich colours play into each other over the surface of the mountains turf the tints of which are interchangeably tawny green olive and brown beds of withered fern and grey rocks being harmoniously blended together <\s>
<s> the mosses and lichens are never so fresh and flourishing as in winter if it be not a season of frost and their minute beauties prodigally adorn the foreground <\s>
<s> wherever we turn we find these productions of nature to which winter is rather favourable than unkindly scattered over the walls banks of earth rocks and stones and upon the trunks of trees with the intermixture of several species of small fern now green and fresh and to the observing passenger their forms and colours are a source of inexhaustable admiration <\s>
<s> add to this the hoar frost and snow with all the varieties they create and which volumes would not be sufficient to describe <\s>
<s> i will content myself with one instance of the colouring produced by snow which may not be uninteresting to painters <\s>
<s> it is extracted from the memorandum book of a friend and for its accuracy i can speak having been an eye witness of the appearance <\s>
<s> i observed says he the beautiful effect of the drifted snow upon the mountains and the perfect tone of colour <\s>
<s> from the top of the mountains downwards a rich olive was produced by the powdery snow and the grass which olive was warmed with a little brown and in this way harmoniously combined by insensible gradations with the white <\s>
<s> the drifting took away the monotony of snow and the whole vale of grasmere seen from the terrace walk in easedale was as varied perhaps more so than even in the pomp of autumn <\s>
<s> in the distance was loughrigg fell the basin wall of the lake this from the summit downward was a rich orange olive then the lake of a bright olive green nearly the same tint as the snow powdered mountain tops and high slopes in easedale and lastly the church with its firs forming the centre of the view <\s>
<s> next to the church came nine distinguishable hills six of them with woody sides turned towards us all of them oak copses with their bright red leaves and snow powdered twigs these hills so variously situated in relation to each other and to the view in general so variously powdered some only enough to give the herbage a rich brown tint one intensely white and lighting up all the others were yet so placed as in the most inobtrusive manner to harmonise by contrast with a perfect naked snowless bleak summit in the far distance <\s>
<s> having spoken of the forms surface and colour of the mountains let us descend into the vales <\s>
<s> though these have been represented under the general image of the spokes of a wheel they are for the most part winding the windings of many being abrupt and intricate <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that in one circumstance the general shape of them all has been determined by that primitive conformation through which so many became receptacles of lakes <\s>
<s> for they are not formed as are most of the celebrated welsh vallies by an approximation of the sloping bases of the opposite mountains towards each other leaving little more between than a channel for the passage of a hasty river but the bottom of these vallies is mostly a spacious and gently declining area apparently level as the floor of a temple or the surface of a lake and broken in many cases by rocks and hills which rise up like islands from the plain <\s>
<s> in such of the vallies as make many windings these level areas open upon the traveller in succession divided from each other sometimes by a mutual approximation of the hills leaving only passage for a river sometimes by correspondent windings without such approximation and sometimes by a bold advance of one mountain towards that which is opposite it <\s>
<s> it may here be observed with propriety that the several rocks and hills which have been described as rising up like islands from the level area of the vale have regulated the choice of the inhabitants in the situation of their dwellings <\s>
<s> where none of these are found and the inclination of the ground is not sufficiently rapid easily to carry off the waters as in the higher part of langdale for instance the houses are not sprinkled over the middle of the vales but confined to their sides being placed merely so far up the mountain as to be protected from the floods <\s>
<s> but where these rocks and hills have been scattered over the plain of the vale as in grasmere donnerdale eskdale c the beauty which they give to the scene is much heightened by a single cottage or cluster of cottages that will be almost always found under them or upon their sides dryness and shelter having tempted the dalesmen to fix their habitations there <\s>
<s> i shall now speak of the lakes of this country <\s>
<s> the form of the lake is most perfect when like derwent water and some of the smaller lakes it least resembles that of a river i mean when being looked at from any given point where the whole may be seen at once the width of it bears such proportion to the length that however the outline may be diversified by far receding bays it never assumes the shape of a river and is contemplated with that placid and quiet feeling which belongs peculiarly to the lake as a body of still water under the influence of no current reflecting therefore the clouds the light and all the imagery of the sky and surrounding hills expressing also and making visible the changes of the atmosphere and motions of the lightest breeze and subject to agitation only from the winds the visible scene would enter unawares into his mind with all its solemn imagery its rocks its woods and that uncertain heaven received into the bosom of the steady lake <\s>
<s> it must be noticed as a favourable characteristic of the lakes of this country that though several of the largest such as winandermere ulswater hawswater do when the whole length of them is commanded from an elevated point loose somewhat of the peculiar form of the lake and assume the resemblance of a magnificent river yet as their shape is winding particularly that of ulswater and hawswater when the view of the whole is obstructed by those barriers which determine the windings and the spectator is confined to one reach the appropriate feeling is revived and one lake may thus in succession present to the eye the essential characteristic of many <\s>
<s> but though the forms of the large lakes have this advantage it is nevertheless favourable to the beauty of the country that the largest of them are comparatively small and that the same vale generally furnishes a succession of lakes instead of being filled with one <\s>
<s> the vales in north wales as hath been observed are not formed for the reception of lakes those of switzerland scotland and this part of the north of england are so formed but in switzerland and scotland the proportion of diffused water is often too great as at the lake of geneva for instance and in most of the scotch lakes <\s>
<s> no doubt it sounds magnificent and flatters the imagination to hear at a distance of expanses of water so many leagues in length and miles in width and such ample room may be delightful to the fresh water sailor scudding with a lively breeze amid the rapidly shifting scenery <\s>
<s> but who ever travelled along the banks of loch lomond variegated as the lower part is by islands without feeling that a speedier termination of the long vista of blank water would be acceptable and without wishing for an interposition of green meadows trees and cottages and a sparkling stream to run by his side <\s>
<s> in fact a notion of grandeur as connected with magnitude has seduced persons of taste into a general mistake upon this subject <\s>
<s> it is much more desirable for the purposes of pleasure that lakes should be numerous and small or middle sized than large not only for communication by walks and rides but for variety and for recurrence of similar appearances <\s>
<s> to illustrate this by one instance how pleasing is it to have a ready and frequent opportunity of watching at the outlet of a lake the stream pushing its way among the rocks in lively contrast with the stillness from which it has escaped and how amusing to compare its noisy and turbulent motions with the gentle playfulness of the breezes that may be starting up or wandering here and there over the faintly rippled surface of the broad water <\s>
<s> i may add as a general remark that in lakes of great width the shores cannot be distinctly seen at the same time and therefore contribute little to mutual illustration and ornament and if the opposite shores are out of sight of each other like those of the american and asiatic lakes then unfortunately the traveller is reminded of a nobler object he has the blankness of a sea prospect without the grandeur and accompanying sense of power <\s>
<s> as the comparatively small size of the lakes in the north of england is favourable to the production of variegated landscape their boundary line also is for the most part gracefully or boldly indented <\s>
<s> that uniformity which prevails in the primitive frame of the lower grounds among all chains or clusters of mountains where large bodies of still water are bedded is broken by the secondary agents of nature ever at work to supply the deficiences of the mould in which things were originally cast <\s>
<s> using the word deficiences i do not speak with reference to those stronger emotions which a region of mountains is peculiarly fitted to excite <\s>
<s> the bases of those huge barriers may run for a long space in straight lines and these parallel to each other the opposite sides of a profound vale may ascend as exact counterparts or in mutual reflection like the billows of a troubled sea and the impression be from its very simplicity more awful and sublime <\s>
<s> sublimity is the result of nature's first great dealings with the superficies of the earth but the general tendency of her subsequent operations is towards the production of beauty by a multiplicity of symmetrical parts uniting in a consistent whole <\s>
<s> this is everywhere exemplified along the margins of these lakes <\s>
<s> the top of it which is only a few steps on the south side affords the best view of the vale which is to be had by a traveller who confines himself to the public road <\s>

<s> the spectator ascends a little platform and sees mountains lakes glaciers rivers woods waterfalls and vallies with their cottages and every other object contained in them lying at his feet all things being represented in their appropriate colours <\s>
<s> it may be easily conceived that this exhibition affords an exquisite delight to the imagination tempting it to wander at will from valley to valley from mountain to mountain through the deepest recesses of the alps <\s>
<s> but it supplies also a more substantial pleasure for the sublime and beautiful region with all its hidden treasures and their bearings and relations to each other is thereby comprehended and understood at once <\s>
<s> something of this kind without touching upon minute details and individualities which would only confuse and embarrass will here be attempted in respect to the lakes in the north of england and the vales and mountains enclosing and surrounding them <\s>

<s> i shall now speak of the lakes of this country <\s>
<s> the form of the lake is most perfect when like derwent water and some of the smaller lakes it least resembles that of a river i mean when being looked at from any given point where the whole may be seen at once the width of it bears such proportion to the length that however the outline may be diversified by far receding bays it never assumes the shape of a river and is contemplated with that placid and quiet feeling which belongs peculiarly to the lake as a body of still water under the influence of no current reflecting therefore the clouds the light and all the imagery of the sky and surrounding hills expressing also and making visible the changes of the atmosphere and motions of the lightest breeze and subject to agitation only from the winds the visible scene would enter unawares into his mind with all its solemn imagery its rocks its woods and that uncertain heaven received into the bosom of the steady lake <\s>
<s> it must be noticed as a favourable characteristic of the lakes of this country that though several of the largest such as winandermere ulswater hawswater do when the whole length of them is commanded from an elevated point loose somewhat of the peculiar form of the lake and assume the resemblance of a magnificent river yet as their shape is winding particularly that of ulswater and hawswater when the view of the whole is obstructed by those barriers which determine the windings and the spectator is confined to one reach the appropriate feeling is revived and one lake may thus in succession present to the eye the essential characteristic of many <\s>
<s> but though the forms of the large lakes have this advantage it is nevertheless favourable to the beauty of the country that the largest of them are comparatively small and that the same vale generally furnishes a succession of lakes instead of being filled with one <\s>
<s> the vales in north wales as hath been observed are not formed for the reception of lakes those of switzerland scotland and this part of the north of england are so formed but in switzerland and scotland the proportion of diffused water is often too great as at the lake of geneva for instance and in most of the scotch lakes <\s>
<s> no doubt it sounds magnificent and flatters the imagination to hear at a distance of expanses of water so many leagues in length and miles in width and such ample room may be delightful to the fresh water sailor scudding with a lively breeze amid the rapidly shifting scenery <\s>
<s> but who ever travelled along the banks of loch lomond variegated as the lower part is by islands without feeling that a speedier termination of the long vista of blank water would be acceptable and without wishing for an interposition of green meadows trees and cottages and a sparkling stream to run by his side <\s>
<s> in fact a notion of grandeur as connected with magnitude has seduced persons of taste into a general mistake upon this subject <\s>
<s> it is much more desirable for the purposes of pleasure that lakes should be numerous and small or middle sized than large not only for communication by walks and rides but for variety and for recurrence of similar appearances <\s>
<s> to illustrate this by one instance how pleasing is it to have a ready and frequent opportunity of watching at the outlet of a lake the stream pushing its way among the rocks in lively contrast with the stillness from which it has escaped and how amusing to compare its noisy and turbulent motions with the gentle playfulness of the breezes that may be starting up or wandering here and there over the faintly rippled surface of the broad water <\s>
<s> i may add as a general remark that in lakes of great width the shores cannot be distinctly seen at the same time and therefore contribute little to mutual illustration and ornament and if the opposite shores are out of sight of each other like those of the american and asiatic lakes then unfortunately the traveller is reminded of a nobler object he has the blankness of a sea prospect without the grandeur and accompanying sense of power <\s>
<s> as the comparatively small size of the lakes in the north of england is favourable to the production of variegated landscape their boundary line also is for the most part gracefully or boldly indented <\s>

<s> it is hoped also that this essay may become generally serviceable by leading to habits of more exact and considerate observation than as far as the writer knows have hitherto been applied to local scenery <\s>
<s> to begin then with the main outlines of the country i know not how to give the reader a distinct image of these more readily than by requesting him to place himself with me in imagination upon some given point let it be the top of either of the mountains great gavel or scawfell or rather let us suppose our station to be a cloud hanging midway between those two mountains at not more than half a mile's distance from the summit of each and not many yards above their highest elevation we shall then see stretched at our feet a number of vallies not fewer than eight diverging from the point on which we are supposed to stand like spokes from the nave of a wheel <\s>
<s> first we note lying to the south east the vale of langdale 50 which will conduct the eye to the long lake of winandermere stretched nearly to the sea or rather to the sands of the vast bay of morcamb serving here for the rim of this imaginary wheel let us trace it in a direction from the south east towards the south and we shall next fix our eyes upon the vale of coniston running up likewise from the sea but not as all the other vallies do to the nave of the wheel and therefore it may be not inaptly represented as a broken spoke sticking in the rim <\s>
<s> looking forth again with an inclination towards the west we see immediately at our feet the vale of duddon in which is no lake but a copious stream winding among fields rocks and mountains and terminating its course in the sands of duddon <\s>
<s> the fourth vale next to be observed viz <\s>
<s> that of the esk is of the same general character as the last yet beautifully discriminated from it by peculiar features <\s>
<s> its stream passes under the woody steep upon which stands muncaster castle the ancient seat of the penningtons and after forming a short and narrow aestuary enters the sea below the small town of ravenglass <\s>
<s> next almost due west look down into and along the deep valley of wastdale with its little chapel and half a dozen neat dwellings scattered upon a plain of meadow and corn ground intersected with stone walls apparently innumerable like a large piece of lawless patch work or an array of mathematical figures such as in the ancient schools of geometry might have been sportively and fantastically traced out upon sand <\s>
<s> beyond this little fertile plain lies within a bed of steep mountains the long narrow stern and desolate lake of wastdale and beyond this a dusky tract of level ground conducts the eye to the irish sea <\s>
<s> the stream that issues from wast water is named the irt and falls into the aestuary of the river esk <\s>
<s> next comes in view ennerdale with its lake of bold and somewhat savage shores <\s>
<s> its stream the ehen or enna flowing through a soft and fertile country passes the town of egremont and the ruins of the castle then seeming like the other rivers to break through the barrier of sand thrown up by the winds on this tempestuous coast enters the irish sea <\s>
<s> the vale of buttermere with the lake and village of that name and crummock water beyond next present themselves <\s>
<s> we will follow the main stream the coker through the fertile and beautiful vale of lorton till it is lost in the derwent below the noble ruins of cockermouth castle <\s>
<s> lastly borrowdale of which the vale of keswick is only a continuation stretching due north brings us to a point nearly opposite to the vale of winandermere with which we began <\s>
<s> from this it will appear that the image of a wheel thus far exact is little more than one half complete but the deficiency on the eastern side may be supplied by the vales of wytheburn ulswater hawswater and the vale of grasmere and rydal none of these however run up to the central point between great gavel and scawfell <\s>
<s> from this hitherto our central point take a flight of not more than four or five miles eastward to the ridge of helvellyn and you will look down upon wytheburn and st <\s>
<s> john's vale which are a branch of the vale of keswick upon ulswater stretching due east and not far beyond to the south east though from this point not visible lie the vale and lake of hawswater and lastly the vale of grasmere rydal and ambleside brings you back to winandermere thus completing though on the eastern side in a somewhat irregular manner the representative figure of the wheel <\s>
<s> 50 anciently spelt langden and so called by the old inhabitants to this day dean from which the latter part of the word is derived being in many parts of england a name for a valley <\s>
<s> such concisely given is the general topographical view of the country of the lakes in the north of england and it may be observed that from the circumference to the centre that is from the sea or plain country to the mountain stations specified there is in the several ridges that enclose these vales and divide them from each other i mean in the forms and surfaces first of the swelling grounds next of the hills and rocks and lastly of the mountains an ascent of almost regular gradation from elegance and richness to their highest point of grandeur and sublimity <\s>
<s> it follows therefore from this first that these rocks hills and mountains must present themselves to view in stages rising above each other the mountains clustering together towards the central point and next that an observer familiar with the several vales must from their various position in relation to the sun have had before his eyes every possible embellishment of beauty dignity and splendour which light and shadow can bestow upon objects so diversified <\s>
<s> for example in the vale of winandermere if the spectator looks for gentle and lovely scenes his eye is turned towards the south if for the grand towards the north in the vale of keswick which as hath been said lies almost due north of this it is directly the reverse <\s>
<s> hence when the sun is setting in summer far to the north west it is seen by the spectator from the shores or breast of winandermere resting among the summits of the loftiest mountains some of which will perhaps be half or wholly hidden by clouds or by the blaze of light which the orb diffuses around it and the surface of the lake will reflect before the eye correspondent colours through every variety of beauty and through all degrees of splendour <\s>
<s> in the vale of keswick at the same period the sun sets over the humbler regions of the landscape and showers down upon them the radiance which at once veils and glorifies sending forth meanwhile broad streams of rosy crimson purple or golden light towards the grand mountains in the south and south east which thus illuminated with all their projections and cavities and with an intermixture of solemn shadows are seen distinctly through a cool and clear atmosphere <\s>
<s> of course there is as marked a difference between the noontide appearance of these two opposite vales <\s>
<s> the bedimming haze that overspreads the south and the clear atmosphere and determined shadows of the clouds in the north at the same time of the day are each seen in these several vales with a contrast as striking <\s>
<s> the reader will easily conceive in what degree the intermediate vales partake of a kindred variety <\s>
<s> i do not indeed know any tract of country in which within so narrow a compass may be found an equal variety in the influences of light and shadow upon the sublime or beautiful features of landscape and it is owing to the combined circumstances to which the reader's attention has been directed <\s>
<s> from a point between great gavel and scawfell a shepherd would not require more than an hour to descend into any one of eight of the principal vales by which he would be surrounded and all the others lie with the exception of hawswater at but a small distance <\s>
<s> yet though clustered together every valley has its distinct and separate character in some instances as if they had been formed in studied contrast to each other and in others with the united pleasing differences and resemblances of a sisterly rivalship <\s>
<s> this concentration of interest gives to the country a decided superiority over the most attractive districts of scotland and wales especially for the pedestrian traveller <\s>
<s> in scotland and wales are found undoubtedly individual scenes which in their several kinds cannot be excelled <\s>
<s> but in scotland particularly what long tracts of desolate country intervene <\s>
<s> so that the traveller when he reaches a spot deservedly of great celebrity would find it difficult to determine how much of his pleasure is owing to excellence inherent in the landscape itself and how much to an instantaneous recovery from an oppression left upon his spirits by the barrenness and desolation through which he has passed <\s>
<s> but to proceed with our survey and first of the mountains <\s>
<s> their forms are endlessly diversified sweeping easily or boldly in simple majesty abrupt and precipitous or soft and elegant <\s>
<s> in magnitude and grandeur they are individually inferior to the most celebrated of those in some other parts of this island but in the combinations which they make towering above each other or lifting themselves in ridges like the waves of a tumultuous sea and in the beauty and variety of their surfaces and colours they are surpassed by none <\s>
<s> the general surface of the mountains is turf rendered rich and green by the moisture of the climate <\s>
<s> sometimes the turf as in the neighbourhood of newlands is little broken the whole covering being soft and downy pasturage <\s>
<s> in other places rocks predominate the soil is laid bare by torrents and burstings of water from the sides of the mountains in heavy rains and not unfrequently their perpendicular sides are seamed by ravines formed also by rains and torrents which meeting in angular points entrench and scar the surface with numerous figures like the letters w <\s>
<s> in the ridge that divides eskdale from wasdale granite is found but the mountains are for the most part composed of the stone by mineralogists termed schist which as you approach the plain country gives place to limestone and freestone but schist being the substance of the mountains the predominant colour of their rocky parts is bluish or hoary grey the general tint of the lichens with which the bare stone is encrusted <\s>
<s> with this blue or grey colour is frequently intermixed a red tinge proceeding from the iron that interveins the stone and impregnates the soil <\s>
<s> the iron is the principle of decomposition in these rocks and hence when they become pulverized the elementary particles crumbling down overspread in many places the steep and almost precipitous sides of the mountains with an intermixture of colours like the compound hues of a dove's neck <\s>
<s> when in the heat of advancing summer the fresh green tint of the herbage has somewhat faded it is again revived by the appearance of the fern profusely spread over the same ground and upon this plant more than upon anything else do the changes which the seasons make in the colouring of the mountains depend <\s>
<s> about the first week in october the rich green which prevailed through the whole summer is usually passed away <\s>
<s> the brilliant and various colours of the fern are then in harmony with the autumnal woods bright yellow or lemon colour at the base of the mountains melting gradually through orange to a dark russet brown towards the summits where the plant being more exposed to the weather is in a more advanced state of decay <\s>
<s> neither heath nor furze are generally found upon the sides of these mountains though in many places they are adorned by those plants so beautiful when in flower <\s>
<s> we may add that the mountains are of height sufficient to have the surface towards the summit softened by distance and to imbibe the finest aërial hues <\s>
<s> in common also with other mountains their apparent forms and colours are perpetually changed by the clouds and vapours which float round them the effect indeed of mist or haze in a country of this character is like that of magic <\s>
<s> i have seen six or seven ridges rising above each other all created in a moment by the vapours upon the side of a mountain which in its ordinary appearance shewed not a projecting point to furnish even a hint for such an operation <\s>
<s> i will take this opportunity of observing that they who have studied the appearances of nature feel that the superiority in point of visual interest of mountainous over other countries is more strikingly displayed in winter than in summer <\s>
<s> this as must be obvious is partly owing to the forms of the mountains which of course are not affected by the seasons but also in no small degree to the greater variety that exists in their winter than their summer colouring <\s>
<s> this variety is such and so harmoniously preserved that it leaves little cause of regret when the splendour of autumn is passed away <\s>
<s> the oak coppices upon the sides of the mountains retain russet leaves the birch stands conspicuous with its silver stem and puce coloured twigs the hollies with green leaves and scarlet berries have come forth to view from among the deciduous trees whose summer foliage had concealed them the ivy is now plentifully apparent upon the stems and boughs of the trees and upon the steep rocks <\s>
<s> in place of the deep summer green of the herbage and fern many rich colours play into each other over the surface of the mountains turf the tints of which are interchangeably tawny green olive and brown beds of withered fern and grey rocks being harmoniously blended together <\s>
<s> the mosses and lichens are never so fresh and flourishing as in winter if it be not a season of frost and their minute beauties prodigally adorn the foreground <\s>
<s> wherever we turn we find these productions of nature to which winter is rather favourable than unkindly scattered over the walls banks of earth rocks and stones and upon the trunks of trees with the intermixture of several species of small fern now green and fresh and to the observing passenger their forms and colours are a source of inexhaustable admiration <\s>
<s> add to this the hoar frost and snow with all the varieties they create and which volumes would not be sufficient to describe <\s>
<s> i will content myself with one instance of the colouring produced by snow which may not be uninteresting to painters <\s>
<s> it is extracted from the memorandum book of a friend and for its accuracy i can speak having been an eye witness of the appearance <\s>
<s> i observed says he the beautiful effect of the drifted snow upon the mountains and the perfect tone of colour <\s>

<s> the fourth vale next to be observed viz <\s>
<s> that of the esk is of the same general character as the last yet beautifully discriminated from it by peculiar features <\s>
<s> its stream passes under the woody steep upon which stands muncaster castle the ancient seat of the penningtons and after forming a short and narrow aestuary enters the sea below the small town of ravenglass <\s>
<s> next almost due west look down into and along the deep valley of wastdale with its little chapel and half a dozen neat dwellings scattered upon a plain of meadow and corn ground intersected with stone walls apparently innumerable like a large piece of lawless patch work or an array of mathematical figures such as in the ancient schools of geometry might have been sportively and fantastically traced out upon sand <\s>
<s> beyond this little fertile plain lies within a bed of steep mountains the long narrow stern and desolate lake of wastdale and beyond this a dusky tract of level ground conducts the eye to the irish sea <\s>
<s> the stream that issues from wast water is named the irt and falls into the aestuary of the river esk <\s>
<s> next comes in view ennerdale with its lake of bold and somewhat savage shores <\s>
<s> its stream the ehen or enna flowing through a soft and fertile country passes the town of egremont and the ruins of the castle then seeming like the other rivers to break through the barrier of sand thrown up by the winds on this tempestuous coast enters the irish sea <\s>
<s> the vale of buttermere with the lake and village of that name and crummock water beyond next present themselves <\s>
<s> we will follow the main stream the coker through the fertile and beautiful vale of lorton till it is lost in the derwent below the noble ruins of cockermouth castle <\s>
<s> lastly borrowdale of which the vale of keswick is only a continuation stretching due north brings us to a point nearly opposite to the vale of winandermere with which we began <\s>
<s> from this it will appear that the image of a wheel thus far exact is little more than one half complete but the deficiency on the eastern side may be supplied by the vales of wytheburn ulswater hawswater and the vale of grasmere and rydal none of these however run up to the central point between great gavel and scawfell <\s>
<s> from this hitherto our central point take a flight of not more than four or five miles eastward to the ridge of helvellyn and you will look down upon wytheburn and st <\s>
<s> john's vale which are a branch of the vale of keswick upon ulswater stretching due east and not far beyond to the south east though from this point not visible lie the vale and lake of hawswater and lastly the vale of grasmere rydal and ambleside brings you back to winandermere thus completing though on the eastern side in a somewhat irregular manner the representative figure of the wheel <\s>
<s> 50 anciently spelt langden and so called by the old inhabitants to this day dean from which the latter part of the word is derived being in many parts of england a name for a valley <\s>
<s> such concisely given is the general topographical view of the country of the lakes in the north of england and it may be observed that from the circumference to the centre that is from the sea or plain country to the mountain stations specified there is in the several ridges that enclose these vales and divide them from each other i mean in the forms and surfaces first of the swelling grounds next of the hills and rocks and lastly of the mountains an ascent of almost regular gradation from elegance and richness to their highest point of grandeur and sublimity <\s>
<s> it follows therefore from this first that these rocks hills and mountains must present themselves to view in stages rising above each other the mountains clustering together towards the central point and next that an observer familiar with the several vales must from their various position in relation to the sun have had before his eyes every possible embellishment of beauty dignity and splendour which light and shadow can bestow upon objects so diversified <\s>
<s> for example in the vale of winandermere if the spectator looks for gentle and lovely scenes his eye is turned towards the south if for the grand towards the north in the vale of keswick which as hath been said lies almost due north of this it is directly the reverse <\s>
<s> hence when the sun is setting in summer far to the north west it is seen by the spectator from the shores or breast of winandermere resting among the summits of the loftiest mountains some of which will perhaps be half or wholly hidden by clouds or by the blaze of light which the orb diffuses around it and the surface of the lake will reflect before the eye correspondent colours through every variety of beauty and through all degrees of splendour <\s>
<s> in the vale of keswick at the same period the sun sets over the humbler regions of the landscape and showers down upon them the radiance which at once veils and glorifies sending forth meanwhile broad streams of rosy crimson purple or golden light towards the grand mountains in the south and south east which thus illuminated with all their projections and cavities and with an intermixture of solemn shadows are seen distinctly through a cool and clear atmosphere <\s>
<s> of course there is as marked a difference between the noontide appearance of these two opposite vales <\s>
<s> the bedimming haze that overspreads the south and the clear atmosphere and determined shadows of the clouds in the north at the same time of the day are each seen in these several vales with a contrast as striking <\s>
<s> the reader will easily conceive in what degree the intermediate vales partake of a kindred variety <\s>
<s> i do not indeed know any tract of country in which within so narrow a compass may be found an equal variety in the influences of light and shadow upon the sublime or beautiful features of landscape and it is owing to the combined circumstances to which the reader's attention has been directed <\s>
<s> from a point between great gavel and scawfell a shepherd would not require more than an hour to descend into any one of eight of the principal vales by which he would be surrounded and all the others lie with the exception of hawswater at but a small distance <\s>
<s> yet though clustered together every valley has its distinct and separate character in some instances as if they had been formed in studied contrast to each other and in others with the united pleasing differences and resemblances of a sisterly rivalship <\s>
<s> this concentration of interest gives to the country a decided superiority over the most attractive districts of scotland and wales especially for the pedestrian traveller <\s>
<s> in scotland and wales are found undoubtedly individual scenes which in their several kinds cannot be excelled <\s>
<s> but in scotland particularly what long tracts of desolate country intervene <\s>
<s> so that the traveller when he reaches a spot deservedly of great celebrity would find it difficult to determine how much of his pleasure is owing to excellence inherent in the landscape itself and how much to an instantaneous recovery from an oppression left upon his spirits by the barrenness and desolation through which he has passed <\s>
<s> but to proceed with our survey and first of the mountains <\s>
<s> their forms are endlessly diversified sweeping easily or boldly in simple majesty abrupt and precipitous or soft and elegant <\s>
<s> in magnitude and grandeur they are individually inferior to the most celebrated of those in some other parts of this island but in the combinations which they make towering above each other or lifting themselves in ridges like the waves of a tumultuous sea and in the beauty and variety of their surfaces and colours they are surpassed by none <\s>
<s> the general surface of the mountains is turf rendered rich and green by the moisture of the climate <\s>
<s> sometimes the turf as in the neighbourhood of newlands is little broken the whole covering being soft and downy pasturage <\s>
<s> in other places rocks predominate the soil is laid bare by torrents and burstings of water from the sides of the mountains in heavy rains and not unfrequently their perpendicular sides are seamed by ravines formed also by rains and torrents which meeting in angular points entrench and scar the surface with numerous figures like the letters w <\s>
<s> in the ridge that divides eskdale from wasdale granite is found but the mountains are for the most part composed of the stone by mineralogists termed schist which as you approach the plain country gives place to limestone and freestone but schist being the substance of the mountains the predominant colour of their rocky parts is bluish or hoary grey the general tint of the lichens with which the bare stone is encrusted <\s>
<s> with this blue or grey colour is frequently intermixed a red tinge proceeding from the iron that interveins the stone and impregnates the soil <\s>
<s> the iron is the principle of decomposition in these rocks and hence when they become pulverized the elementary particles crumbling down overspread in many places the steep and almost precipitous sides of the mountains with an intermixture of colours like the compound hues of a dove's neck <\s>
<s> when in the heat of advancing summer the fresh green tint of the herbage has somewhat faded it is again revived by the appearance of the fern profusely spread over the same ground and upon this plant more than upon anything else do the changes which the seasons make in the colouring of the mountains depend <\s>
<s> about the first week in october the rich green which prevailed through the whole summer is usually passed away <\s>
<s> the brilliant and various colours of the fern are then in harmony with the autumnal woods bright yellow or lemon colour at the base of the mountains melting gradually through orange to a dark russet brown towards the summits where the plant being more exposed to the weather is in a more advanced state of decay <\s>
<s> neither heath nor furze are generally found upon the sides of these mountains though in many places they are adorned by those plants so beautiful when in flower <\s>
<s> we may add that the mountains are of height sufficient to have the surface towards the summit softened by distance and to imbibe the finest aërial hues <\s>
<s> in common also with other mountains their apparent forms and colours are perpetually changed by the clouds and vapours which float round them the effect indeed of mist or haze in a country of this character is like that of magic <\s>
<s> i have seen six or seven ridges rising above each other all created in a moment by the vapours upon the side of a mountain which in its ordinary appearance shewed not a projecting point to furnish even a hint for such an operation <\s>
<s> i will take this opportunity of observing that they who have studied the appearances of nature feel that the superiority in point of visual interest of mountainous over other countries is more strikingly displayed in winter than in summer <\s>
<s> this as must be obvious is partly owing to the forms of the mountains which of course are not affected by the seasons but also in no small degree to the greater variety that exists in their winter than their summer colouring <\s>
<s> this variety is such and so harmoniously preserved that it leaves little cause of regret when the splendour of autumn is passed away <\s>
<s> the oak coppices upon the sides of the mountains retain russet leaves the birch stands conspicuous with its silver stem and puce coloured twigs the hollies with green leaves and scarlet berries have come forth to view from among the deciduous trees whose summer foliage had concealed them the ivy is now plentifully apparent upon the stems and boughs of the trees and upon the steep rocks <\s>
<s> in place of the deep summer green of the herbage and fern many rich colours play into each other over the surface of the mountains turf the tints of which are interchangeably tawny green olive and brown beds of withered fern and grey rocks being harmoniously blended together <\s>
<s> the mosses and lichens are never so fresh and flourishing as in winter if it be not a season of frost and their minute beauties prodigally adorn the foreground <\s>
<s> wherever we turn we find these productions of nature to which winter is rather favourable than unkindly scattered over the walls banks of earth rocks and stones and upon the trunks of trees with the intermixture of several species of small fern now green and fresh and to the observing passenger their forms and colours are a source of inexhaustable admiration <\s>
<s> add to this the hoar frost and snow with all the varieties they create and which volumes would not be sufficient to describe <\s>
<s> i will content myself with one instance of the colouring produced by snow which may not be uninteresting to painters <\s>
<s> it is extracted from the memorandum book of a friend and for its accuracy i can speak having been an eye witness of the appearance <\s>
<s> i observed says he the beautiful effect of the drifted snow upon the mountains and the perfect tone of colour <\s>
<s> from the top of the mountains downwards a rich olive was produced by the powdery snow and the grass which olive was warmed with a little brown and in this way harmoniously combined by insensible gradations with the white <\s>
<s> the drifting took away the monotony of snow and the whole vale of grasmere seen from the terrace walk in easedale was as varied perhaps more so than even in the pomp of autumn <\s>
<s> in the distance was loughrigg fell the basin wall of the lake this from the summit downward was a rich orange olive then the lake of a bright olive green nearly the same tint as the snow powdered mountain tops and high slopes in easedale and lastly the church with its firs forming the centre of the view <\s>
<s> next to the church came nine distinguishable hills six of them with woody sides turned towards us all of them oak copses with their bright red leaves and snow powdered twigs these hills so variously situated in relation to each other and to the view in general so variously powdered some only enough to give the herbage a rich brown tint one intensely white and lighting up all the others were yet so placed as in the most inobtrusive manner to harmonise by contrast with a perfect naked snowless bleak summit in the far distance <\s>
<s> having spoken of the forms surface and colour of the mountains let us descend into the vales <\s>
<s> though these have been represented under the general image of the spokes of a wheel they are for the most part winding the windings of many being abrupt and intricate <\s>
<s> and it may be observed that in one circumstance the general shape of them all has been determined by that primitive conformation through which so many became receptacles of lakes <\s>
<s> for they are not formed as are most of the celebrated welsh vallies by an approximation of the sloping bases of the opposite mountains towards each other leaving little more between than a channel for the passage of a hasty river but the bottom of these vallies is mostly a spacious and gently declining area apparently level as the floor of a temple or the surface of a lake and broken in many cases by rocks and hills which rise up like islands from the plain <\s>
<s> in such of the vallies as make many windings these level areas open upon the traveller in succession divided from each other sometimes by a mutual approximation of the hills leaving only passage for a river sometimes by correspondent windings without such approximation and sometimes by a bold advance of one mountain towards that which is opposite it <\s>
<s> it may here be observed with propriety that the several rocks and hills which have been described as rising up like islands from the level area of the vale have regulated the choice of the inhabitants in the situation of their dwellings <\s>
<s> where none of these are found and the inclination of the ground is not sufficiently rapid easily to carry off the waters as in the higher part of langdale for instance the houses are not sprinkled over the middle of the vales but confined to their sides being placed merely so far up the mountain as to be protected from the floods <\s>
<s> but where these rocks and hills have been scattered over the plain of the vale as in grasmere donnerdale eskdale c the beauty which they give to the scene is much heightened by a single cottage or cluster of cottages that will be almost always found under them or upon their sides dryness and shelter having tempted the dalesmen to fix their habitations there <\s>
<s> i shall now speak of the lakes of this country <\s>
<s> the form of the lake is most perfect when like derwent water and some of the smaller lakes it least resembles that of a river i mean when being looked at from any given point where the whole may be seen at once the width of it bears such proportion to the length that however the outline may be diversified by far receding bays it never assumes the shape of a river and is contemplated with that placid and quiet feeling which belongs peculiarly to the lake as a body of still water under the influence of no current reflecting therefore the clouds the light and all the imagery of the sky and surrounding hills expressing also and making visible the changes of the atmosphere and motions of the lightest breeze and subject to agitation only from the winds the visible scene would enter unawares into his mind with all its solemn imagery its rocks its woods and that uncertain heaven received into the bosom of the steady lake <\s>
<s> it must be noticed as a favourable characteristic of the lakes of this country that though several of the largest such as winandermere ulswater hawswater do when the whole length of them is commanded from an elevated point loose somewhat of the peculiar form of the lake and assume the resemblance of a magnificent river yet as their shape is winding particularly that of ulswater and hawswater when the view of the whole is obstructed by those barriers which determine the windings and the spectator is confined to one reach the appropriate feeling is revived and one lake may thus in succession present to the eye the essential characteristic of many <\s>
<s> but though the forms of the large lakes have this advantage it is nevertheless favourable to the beauty of the country that the largest of them are comparatively small and that the same vale generally furnishes a succession of lakes instead of being filled with one <\s>
<s> the vales in north wales as hath been observed are not formed for the reception of lakes those of switzerland scotland and this part of the north of england are so formed but in switzerland and scotland the proportion of diffused water is often too great as at the lake of geneva for instance and in most of the scotch lakes <\s>
<s> no doubt it sounds magnificent and flatters the imagination to hear at a distance of expanses of water so many leagues in length and miles in width and such ample room may be delightful to the fresh water sailor scudding with a lively breeze amid the rapidly shifting scenery <\s>
<s> but who ever travelled along the banks of loch lomond variegated as the lower part is by islands without feeling that a speedier termination of the long vista of blank water would be acceptable and without wishing for an interposition of green meadows trees and cottages and a sparkling stream to run by his side <\s>
<s> in fact a notion of grandeur as connected with magnitude has seduced persons of taste into a general mistake upon this subject <\s>
<s> it is much more desirable for the purposes of pleasure that lakes should be numerous and small or middle sized than large not only for communication by walks and rides but for variety and for recurrence of similar appearances <\s>
<s> to illustrate this by one instance how pleasing is it to have a ready and frequent opportunity of watching at the outlet of a lake the stream pushing its way among the rocks in lively contrast with the stillness from which it has escaped and how amusing to compare its noisy and turbulent motions with the gentle playfulness of the breezes that may be starting up or wandering here and there over the faintly rippled surface of the broad water <\s>
<s> i may add as a general remark that in lakes of great width the shores cannot be distinctly seen at the same time and therefore contribute little to mutual illustration and ornament and if the opposite shores are out of sight of each other like those of the american and asiatic lakes then unfortunately the traveller is reminded of a nobler object he has the blankness of a sea prospect without the grandeur and accompanying sense of power <\s>
<s> as the comparatively small size of the lakes in the north of england is favourable to the production of variegated landscape their boundary line also is for the most part gracefully or boldly indented <\s>
<s> that uniformity which prevails in the primitive frame of the lower grounds among all chains or clusters of mountains where large bodies of still water are bedded is broken by the secondary agents of nature ever at work to supply the deficiences of the mould in which things were originally cast <\s>
<s> using the word deficiences i do not speak with reference to those stronger emotions which a region of mountains is peculiarly fitted to excite <\s>
<s> the bases of those huge barriers may run for a long space in straight lines and these parallel to each other the opposite sides of a profound vale may ascend as exact counterparts or in mutual reflection like the billows of a troubled sea and the impression be from its very simplicity more awful and sublime <\s>
<s> sublimity is the result of nature's first great dealings with the superficies of the earth but the general tendency of her subsequent operations is towards the production of beauty by a multiplicity of symmetrical parts uniting in a consistent whole <\s>
<s> this is everywhere exemplified along the margins of these lakes <\s>

<s> birthday in america and at home church poetry <\s>
<s> letter to professor reed <\s>
<s> in your last letter you speak so feelingly of the manner in which my birthday april 7 has been noticed both privately in your country and somewhat publicly in my own neighbourhood that i cannot forbear adding a word or two upon the subject <\s>
<s> it would have delighted you to see the assemblage in front of our house some dancing upon the gravel platform old and young as described in goldsmith's travels and others children i mean chasing each other upon the little plot of lawn to which you descend by steps from the platform <\s>
<s> we had music of our own preparing and two sets of casual itinerants italians and germans came in successively and enlivened the festivity <\s>
<s> there were present upwards of 300 children and about 150 adults of both sexes and all ages the children in their best attire and of that happy and i may say beautiful race which is spread over this highly favoured portion of england <\s>
<s> the tables were tastefully arranged in the open air 204 oranges and gingerbread in piles decorated with evergreens and spring flowers and all partook of tea the young in the open air and the old within doors <\s>
<s> i must own i wish that little commemorations of this kind were more common among us <\s>
<s> it is melancholy to think how little that portion of the community which is quite at ease in their circumstances have to do in a social way with the humbler classes <\s>
<s> they purchase commodities of them or they employ them as labourers or they visit them in charity for the sake of supplying their most urgent wants by alms giving <\s>
<s> but this alas is far from enough one would wish to see the rich mingle with the poor as much as may be upon a footing of fraternal equality <\s>
<s> the old feudal dependencies and relations are almost gone from england and nothing has yet come adequately to supply their place <\s>
<s> there are tendencies of the right kind here and there but they are rather accidental than aught that is established in general manners <\s>
<s> why should not great land owners look for a substitute for what is lost of feudal paternity in the higher principles of christianised humanity and humble minded brotherhood <\s>
<s> and why should not this extend to those vast communities which crowd so many parts of england under one head in the different sorts of manufacture which for the want of it are too often the pests of the social state <\s>
<s> we are however improving and i trust that the example set by some mill owners will not fail to influence others <\s>

<s> it is not for me to say how far i am entitled to the honour which he has done me but i can sincerely say that it has been the main scope of my writings to do what he says i have accomplished <\s>
<s> and where could i find a more trustworthy judge <\s>
<s> what you advise in respect to a separate publication of my church poetry i have often turned in my own mind but i have really done so little in that way compared with the magnitude of the subject that i have not courage to venture on such a publication <\s>
<s> besides it would not i fear pay its expenses <\s>
<s> the sonnets were so published upon the recommendation of a deceased nephew of mine one of the first scholars of europe and as good as he was learned <\s>
<s> the volume did not i believe clear itself and a great part of the impression though latterly offered at a reduced price still remains i believe in mr <\s>
<s> in this country people who do not grudge laying out their money for new publications on personal or fugitive interests that every one is talking about are very unwilling to part with it for literature which is unindebted to temporary excitement <\s>

<s> i must own i wish that little commemorations of this kind were more common among us <\s>

<s> the old feudal dependencies and relations are almost gone from england and nothing has yet come adequately to supply their place <\s>

<s> what you advise in respect to a separate publication of my church poetry i have often turned in my own mind but i have really done so little in that way compared with the magnitude of the subject that i have not courage to venture on such a publication <\s>

<s> we had music of our own preparing and two sets of casual itinerants italians and germans came in successively and enlivened the festivity <\s>

<s> i must own i wish that little commemorations of this kind were more common among us <\s>
<s> it is melancholy to think how little that portion of the community which is quite at ease in their circumstances have to do in a social way with the humbler classes <\s>

<s> but this alas is far from enough one would wish to see the rich mingle with the poor as much as may be upon a footing of fraternal equality <\s>
<s> the old feudal dependencies and relations are almost gone from england and nothing has yet come adequately to supply their place <\s>
<s> there are tendencies of the right kind here and there but they are rather accidental than aught that is established in general manners <\s>
<s> why should not great land owners look for a substitute for what is lost of feudal paternity in the higher principles of christianised humanity and humble minded brotherhood <\s>

<s> letter to professor reed <\s>
<s> in your last letter you speak so feelingly of the manner in which my birthday april 7 has been noticed both privately in your country and somewhat publicly in my own neighbourhood that i cannot forbear adding a word or two upon the subject <\s>
<s> it would have delighted you to see the assemblage in front of our house some dancing upon the gravel platform old and young as described in goldsmith's travels and others children i mean chasing each other upon the little plot of lawn to which you descend by steps from the platform <\s>
<s> we had music of our own preparing and two sets of casual itinerants italians and germans came in successively and enlivened the festivity <\s>
<s> there were present upwards of 300 children and about 150 adults of both sexes and all ages the children in their best attire and of that happy and i may say beautiful race which is spread over this highly favoured portion of england <\s>
<s> the tables were tastefully arranged in the open air 204 oranges and gingerbread in piles decorated with evergreens and spring flowers and all partook of tea the young in the open air and the old within doors <\s>
<s> i must own i wish that little commemorations of this kind were more common among us <\s>
<s> it is melancholy to think how little that portion of the community which is quite at ease in their circumstances have to do in a social way with the humbler classes <\s>
<s> they purchase commodities of them or they employ them as labourers or they visit them in charity for the sake of supplying their most urgent wants by alms giving <\s>
<s> but this alas is far from enough one would wish to see the rich mingle with the poor as much as may be upon a footing of fraternal equality <\s>
<s> the old feudal dependencies and relations are almost gone from england and nothing has yet come adequately to supply their place <\s>
<s> there are tendencies of the right kind here and there but they are rather accidental than aught that is established in general manners <\s>
<s> why should not great land owners look for a substitute for what is lost of feudal paternity in the higher principles of christianised humanity and humble minded brotherhood <\s>
<s> and why should not this extend to those vast communities which crowd so many parts of england under one head in the different sorts of manufacture which for the want of it are too often the pests of the social state <\s>

<s> it is not for me to say how far i am entitled to the honour which he has done me but i can sincerely say that it has been the main scope of my writings to do what he says i have accomplished <\s>
<s> and where could i find a more trustworthy judge <\s>
<s> what you advise in respect to a separate publication of my church poetry i have often turned in my own mind but i have really done so little in that way compared with the magnitude of the subject that i have not courage to venture on such a publication <\s>
<s> besides it would not i fear pay its expenses <\s>

<s> letter to professor reed <\s>
<s> in your last letter you speak so feelingly of the manner in which my birthday april 7 has been noticed both privately in your country and somewhat publicly in my own neighbourhood that i cannot forbear adding a word or two upon the subject <\s>
<s> it would have delighted you to see the assemblage in front of our house some dancing upon the gravel platform old and young as described in goldsmith's travels and others children i mean chasing each other upon the little plot of lawn to which you descend by steps from the platform <\s>
<s> we had music of our own preparing and two sets of casual itinerants italians and germans came in successively and enlivened the festivity <\s>
<s> there were present upwards of 300 children and about 150 adults of both sexes and all ages the children in their best attire and of that happy and i may say beautiful race which is spread over this highly favoured portion of england <\s>
<s> the tables were tastefully arranged in the open air 204 oranges and gingerbread in piles decorated with evergreens and spring flowers and all partook of tea the young in the open air and the old within doors <\s>
<s> i must own i wish that little commemorations of this kind were more common among us <\s>
<s> it is melancholy to think how little that portion of the community which is quite at ease in their circumstances have to do in a social way with the humbler classes <\s>
<s> they purchase commodities of them or they employ them as labourers or they visit them in charity for the sake of supplying their most urgent wants by alms giving <\s>
<s> but this alas is far from enough one would wish to see the rich mingle with the poor as much as may be upon a footing of fraternal equality <\s>
<s> the old feudal dependencies and relations are almost gone from england and nothing has yet come adequately to supply their place <\s>
<s> there are tendencies of the right kind here and there but they are rather accidental than aught that is established in general manners <\s>
<s> why should not great land owners look for a substitute for what is lost of feudal paternity in the higher principles of christianised humanity and humble minded brotherhood <\s>
<s> and why should not this extend to those vast communities which crowd so many parts of england under one head in the different sorts of manufacture which for the want of it are too often the pests of the social state <\s>
<s> we are however improving and i trust that the example set by some mill owners will not fail to influence others <\s>

<s> it is not for me to say how far i am entitled to the honour which he has done me but i can sincerely say that it has been the main scope of my writings to do what he says i have accomplished <\s>
<s> and where could i find a more trustworthy judge <\s>
<s> what you advise in respect to a separate publication of my church poetry i have often turned in my own mind but i have really done so little in that way compared with the magnitude of the subject that i have not courage to venture on such a publication <\s>
<s> besides it would not i fear pay its expenses <\s>

<s> on our return home we were detained two hours at northampton by the vast crowd assembled to greet the queen on her way to burleigh house <\s>
<s> shouts and ringing of bells there were in abundance but these are things of course <\s>
<s> it did please us however greatly to see every village we passed through for the space of twenty two miles decorated with triumphal arches and every cottage however humble with its little display of laurel boughs and flowers hung from the windows and over the doors <\s>

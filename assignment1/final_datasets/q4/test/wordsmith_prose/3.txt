<s> what an effect says the governor of cadiz must it have upon the people he means the spanish people to know that a single soldier was carrying away 2580 livres tournois <\s>
<s> what an effect he might have said also must it have upon the french i direct the reader's attention to this because it seems to have been overlooked and because some of the public journals speaking of the convention and no doubt uttering the sentiments of several of their readers say that they are disgusted with the transaction not because the french have been permitted to carry off a few diamonds or some ingots of silver but because we confessed by consenting to the treaty that an army of 35,000 british troops aided by the portugueze nation was not able to compel 20,000 french to surrender at discretion <\s>
<s> this is indeed the root of the evil as hath been shewn and it is the curse of this treaty that the several parts of it are of such enormity as singly to occupy the attention and to destroy comparison and coexistence <\s>
<s> but the people of great britain are disgusted both with the one and the other <\s>
<s> they bewail the violation of the principle if the value of the things carried off had been in itself trifling their grief and their indignation would have been scarcely less <\s>
<s> but it is manifest from what has been said that it was not trifling and that therefore upon that account as well as upon others this permission was no less impolitic than it was unjust and dishonourable <\s>
<s> in illustrating these articles of the armistice and convention by which the french were both expressly permitted and indirectly enabled to carry off their booty we have already seen that a concession was made which is still more enormous viz <\s>
<s> that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or resident there and all natives of portugal who have accepted situations under the french government c shall have their property of every kind guaranteed to them by the british army <\s>
<s> by articles 16th and 17th their persons are placed under the like protection <\s>
<s> the french article xvi shall be at liberty either to accompany the french army or to remain in portugal and the portugueze article xvii shall not be rendered accountable for their political conduct during the period of the occupation of the country by the french army they all are placed under the protection of the british commanders and shall sustain no injury in their property or persons <\s>
<s> i have animadverted heretofore upon the unprofessional eagerness of our generals to appear in the character of negotiators when the sword would have done them more service than the pen <\s>
<s> but if they had confined themselves to mere military regulations they might indeed with justice have been grievously censured as injudicious commanders whose notion of the honour of armies was of a low pitch and who had no conception of the peculiar nature of the service in which they were engaged but the censure must have stopped here <\s>
<s> whereas by these provisions they have shewn that they have never reflected upon the nature of military authority as contra distinguished from civil <\s>
<s> french example had so far dazzled and blinded them that the french army is suffered to denominate itself the french government and from the whole tenour of these instruments from the preamble and these articles especially it should seem that our generals fancied themselves and their army to be the british government <\s>
<s> for these regulations emanating from a mere military authority are purely civil but of such a kind that no power on earth could confer a right to establish them <\s>
<s> and this trampling upon the most sacred rights this sacrifice of the consciousness of a self preserving principle without which neither societies nor governments can exist is not made by our generals in relation to subjects of their own sovereign but to an independent nation our ally into whose territories we could not have entered but from its confidence in our friendship and good faith <\s>
<s> surely the persons who under the countenance of too high authority have talked so loudly of prejudging this question entirely overlooked or utterly forgot this part of it <\s>
<s> what have these monstrous provisions to do with the relative strength of the two armies or with any point admitting a doubt <\s>
<s> what need here of a court of judicature to settle who were the persons their names are subscribed by their own hands and to determine the quality of the thing <\s>
<s> actions and agents like these exhibited in this connection with each other must of necessity be condemned the moment they are known and to assert the contrary is to maintain that man is a being without understanding and that morality is an empty dream <\s>
<s> and if this condemnation must after this manner follow to utter it is less a duty than a further inevitable consequence from the constitution of human nature <\s>
<s> they who hold that the formal sanction of a court of judicature is in this case required before a people has a right to pass sentence know not to what degree they are enemies to that people and to mankind to what degree selfishness whether arising from their peculiar situation or from other causes has in them prevailed over those faculties which are our common inheritance and cut them off from fellowship with the species <\s>
<s> most deplorable would be the result if it were possible that the injunctions of these men could be obeyed or their remonstrances acknowledged to be just <\s>
<s> for not to mention that if it were not for such prompt decisions of the public voice misdemeanours of men high in office would rarely be accounted for at all we must bear in mind at this crisis that the adversary of all good is hourly and daily extending his ravages and according to such notions of fitness our indignation our sorrow our shame our sense of right and wrong and all those moral affections and powers of the understanding by which alone he can be effectually opposed are to enter upon a long vacation their motion is to be suspended a thing impossible if it could it would be destroyed <\s>
<s> let us now see what language the portugueze speak upon that part of the treaty which has incited me to give vent to these feelings and to assert these truths <\s>
<s> i protest says general friere against article xvii one of the two now under examination because it attempts to tie down the government of this kingdom not to bring to justice and condign punishment those persons who have been notoriously and scandalously disloyal to their prince and the country by joining and serving the french party and even if the english army should be allowed to screen them from the punishment they have deserved still it should not prevent their expulsion whereby this country would no longer have to fear being again betrayed by the same men <\s>
<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>
<s> couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange <\s>
<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>
<s> which amounts to this <\s>
<s> the french are called upon formally to relinquish in favour of the portugueze that to which they never had any right to abandon false claims which they either had a power to enforce or they had not if they departed immediately and had not power the article was nugatory if they remained a day longer and had power there was no security that they would abide by it <\s>
<s> accordingly loud complaints were made that after the date of the convention all kinds of ravages were committed by the french upon lisbon and its neighbourhood and what did it matter whether these were upon the plea of old debts and requisitions or new debts were created more greedily than ever from the consciousness that the time for collecting them was so short <\s>
<s> this article then the only one which is even in shew favourable to the portugueze is in substance nothing inasmuch as in what it is silent upon viz <\s>
<s> that the people of lisbon and its neighbourhood shall not be vexed and oppressed by the french during their stay with new claims and robberies it is grossly cruel or negligent and in that for which it actually stipulates wholly delusive <\s>
<s> it is in fact insulting for the very admission of a formal renunciation of these claims does to a certain degree acknowledge their justice <\s>
<s> the only decent manner of introducing matter to this effect would have been by placing it as a bye clause of a provision that secured the portugueze from further molestations and merely alluding to it as a thing understood of course <\s>
<s> yet from the place which this specious article occupies preceding immediately the 16th and 17th which we have been last considering it is clear that it must have been intended by the french general as honey smeared upon the edge of the cup to make the poison contained in those two more palateable <\s>
<s> thus much for the portugueze and their particular interests <\s>
<s> in one instance a concern of the spanish nation comes directly under notice and that nation also is treated without delicacy or feeling <\s>
<s> for by the 18th article it is agreed that the spaniards 4000 in number who had been disarmed and were confined on ship board in the port of lisbon by the french should be liberated <\s>
<s> and upon what consideration <\s>
<s> not upon their right to be free as having been treacherously and cruelly dealt with by men who were part of a power that was labouring to subjugate their country and in this attempt had committed inhuman crimes against it not even exchanged as soldiers against soldiers but the condition of their emancipation is that the british general engages to obtain of the spaniards to restore such french subjects either military or civil as have been detained in spain without having been taken in battle or in consequence of military operations but on account of the occurrences of the 29th of last may and the days immediately following <\s>
<s> i know not what are exactly the features of the face for which this word serves as a veil i have no register at hand to inform me what these events precisely were but there can be no doubt that it was a time of triumph for liberty and humanity and that the persons for whom these noble minded spaniards were to be exchanged were no other than a horde from among the most abject of the french nation probably those wretches who having never faced either the dangers or the fatigues of war had been most busy in secret preparations or were most conspicuous in open acts of massacre when the streets of madrid a few weeks before had been drenched with the blood of two thousand of her bravest citizens <\s>
<s> yet the liberation of these spaniards upon these terms is recorded in the report of the court of enquiry as one of the advantages which in the contemplation of the generals would result from the convention <\s>
<s> finally if there shall be any doubt article xiv as to the meaning of any article it shall be explained favourably to the french army and hostages article xx of the rank of field officers on the part of the british army and navy shall be furnished for the guarantee of the present convention <\s>
<s> i have now gone through the painful task of examining the most material conditions of the convention of cintra the whole number of the articles is twenty two with three additional ones a long ladder into a deep abyss of infamy need it be said that neglects injuries and insults like these which we have been contemplating come from what quarter they may let them be exhibited towards whom they will must produce not merely mistrust and jealousy but alienation and hatred <\s>
<s> the passions and feelings may be quieted or diverted for a short time but though out of sight or seemingly asleep they must exist and the life which they have received cannot but by a long course of justice and kindness be overcome and destroyed <\s>
<s> but why talk of a long course of justice and kindness when the immediate result must have been so deplorable <\s>
<s> relying upon our humanity our fellow feeling and our justice upon these instant and urgent claims sanctioned by the more mild one of ancient alliance the portugueze people by voices from every part of their land entreated our succour the arrival of a british army upon their coasts was joyfully hailed and the people of the country zealously assisted in landing the troops without which help as a british general has informed us that landing could not have been effected <\s>
<s> and it is in this manner that they are repaid <\s>
<s> to some port between rochefort and l'orient and be at liberty to serve i come to that memorable condition article v that the french army shall carry with it all its equipments that is to say its military chests and carriages attached to the field commissariat and field hospitals or shall be allowed to dispose of such part as the commander in chief may judge it unnecessary to embark <\s>

<s> i have now gone through the painful task of examining the most material conditions of the convention of cintra the whole number of the articles is twenty two with three additional ones a long ladder into a deep abyss of infamy need it be said that neglects injuries and insults like these which we have been contemplating come from what quarter they may let them be exhibited towards whom they will must produce not merely mistrust and jealousy but alienation and hatred <\s>
<s> the passions and feelings may be quieted or diverted for a short time but though out of sight or seemingly asleep they must exist and the life which they have received cannot but by a long course of justice and kindness be overcome and destroyed <\s>
<s> but why talk of a long course of justice and kindness when the immediate result must have been so deplorable <\s>
<s> relying upon our humanity our fellow feeling and our justice upon these instant and urgent claims sanctioned by the more mild one of ancient alliance the portugueze people by voices from every part of their land entreated our succour the arrival of a british army upon their coasts was joyfully hailed and the people of the country zealously assisted in landing the troops without which help as a british general has informed us that landing could not have been effected <\s>
<s> and it is in this manner that they are repaid <\s>
<s> to some port between rochefort and l'orient and be at liberty to serve i come to that memorable condition article v that the french army shall carry with it all its equipments that is to say its military chests and carriages attached to the field commissariat and field hospitals or shall be allowed to dispose of such part as the commander in chief may judge it unnecessary to embark <\s>
<s> in like manner all individuals of the army shall be at liberty to dispose of their private property of every description with full security hereafter for the purchasers <\s>
<s> this is expressed still more pointedly in the armistice though the meaning implied in the two articles is precisely the same <\s>
<s> for in the fifth article of the armistice it is agreed provisionally that all those of whom the french army consists shall be conveyed to france with arms and baggage and all their private property of every description no part of which shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> in the convention it is only expressed that they shall be at liberty to depart article ii with arms and baggage and article v to dispose of their private property of every description <\s>
<s> but if they had a right to dispose of it this would include a right to carry it away which was undoubtedly understood by the french general <\s>
<s> and in the armistice it is expressly said that their private property of every description shall be conveyed to france along with their persons <\s>
<s> what then are we to understand by the words their private property of every description <\s>
<s> equipments of the army in general and baggage of individuals had been stipulated for before now we all know that the lawful professional gains and earnings of a soldier must be small that he is not in the habit of carrying about him during actual warfare any accumulation of these or other property and that the ordinary private property which he can be supposed to have a just title to is included under the name of his baggage therefore this was something more and what it was is apparent <\s>
<s> no part of their property says the armistice shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> who does not see in these words the consciousness of guilt an indirect self betraying admission that they had in their hands treasures which might be lawfully taken from them and an anxiety to prevent that act of justice by a positive stipulation <\s>
<s> who does not see on what sort of property the frenchman had his eye that it was not property by right but their possessions their plunder every thing by what means soever acquired that the french army or any individual in it was possessed of <\s>
<s> but it has been urged that the monstrousness of such a supposition precludes this interpretation renders it impossible that it could either be intended by the one party or so understood by the other <\s>
<s> what right they who signed and he who ratified this convention have to shelter themselves under this plea will appear from the 16th and 17th articles <\s>
<s> in these it is stipulated that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or accidentally in the country shall have their property of every kind moveable and immoveable guaranteed to them with liberty of retaining or disposing of it and passing the produce into france the same is stipulated article xvii for such natives of portugal as have sided with the french or occupied situations under the french government <\s>
<s> here then is a direct avowal still more monstrous that every frenchman or native of a country in alliance with france however obnoxious his crimes may have made him and every traitorous portugueze shall have his property guaranteed to him both previously to and after the reinstatement of the portugueze government by the british army <\s>
<s> now let us ask what sense the word property must have had fastened to it in these cases <\s>
<s> must it not necessarily have included all the rewards which the frenchman had received for his iniquity and the traitorous portugueze for his treason <\s>
<s> for no man would bear a part in such oppressions or would be a traitor for nothing and moreover all the rewards which the french could bestow must have been taken from the portugueze extorted from the honest and loyal to be given to the wicked and disloyal these rewards of iniquity must necessarily have been included for on our side no attempt is made at a distinction and on the side of the french the word immoveable is manifestly intended to preclude such a distinction where alone it could have been effectual <\s>
<s> property then here means possessions thus infamously acquired and in the instance of the portugueze the fundamental notion of the word is subverted for a traitor can have no property till the government of his own country has remitted the punishment due to his crimes <\s>
<s> and these wages of guilt which the master by such exactions was enabled to pay and which the servant thus earned are to be guaranteed to him by a british army <\s>
<s> where does there exist a power on earth that could confer this right <\s>
<s> if the portugueze government itself had acted in this manner it would have been guilty of wilful suicide and the nation if it had acted so of high treason against itself <\s>
<s> let it not then be said that the monstrousness of covenanting to convey along with the persons of the french their plunder secures the article from the interpretation which the people of great britain gave and which i have now proved they were bound to give to it but conceding for a moment that it was not intended that the words should bear this sense and that neither in a fair grammatical construction nor as illustrated by other passages or by the general tenour of the document they actually did bear it had not unquestionable voices proclaimed the cruelty and rapacity the acts of sacrilege assassination and robbery by which these treasures had been amassed <\s>
<s> was not the perfidy of the french army and its contempt of moral obligation both as a body and as to the individuals which composed it infamous through europe therefore the concession would signify nothing for our generals by allowing an army of this character to depart with its equipments waggons military chest and baggage had provided abundant means to enable it to carry off whatsoever it desired and thus to elude and frustrate any stipulations which might have been made for compelling it to restore that which had been so iniquitously seized <\s>
<s> and here are we brought back to the fountain head of all this baseness to that apathy and deadness to the principle of justice through the influence of which this army outlawed by its crimes was suffered to depart from the land over which it had so long tyrannized other than as a band of disarmed prisoners i maintain therefore that permission to carry off the booty was distinctly expressed and if it had not been so that the principle of justice could not here be preserved as a violation of it must necessarily have followed from other conditions of the treaty <\s>
<s> sir hew dalrymple himself before the court of inquiry has told us in two letters to generals beresford and friere that such part of the plunder as was in money it would be difficult if not impossible to identify and consequently the french could not be prevented from carrying it away with them <\s>
<s> from the same letters we learn that the french were intending to carry off a considerable part of their plunder by calling it public money and saying that it belonged to the military chest and that their evasions of the article were most shameful and evinced a want of probity and honour which was most disgraceful to them <\s>
<s> if the french had given no other proofs of their want of such virtues than those furnished by this occasion neither the portugueze nor spanish nor british nations would condemn them nor hate them as they now do; nor would this article of the convention have excited such indignation <\s>
<s> for the french by so acting could not deem themselves breaking an engagement no doubt they looked upon themselves as injured that the failure in good faith was on the part of the british and that it was in the lawlessness of power and by a mere quibble that this construction was afterwards put upon the article in question <\s>
<s> widely different from the conduct of the british was that of the spaniards in a like case with high feeling did they abating not a jot or a tittle enforce the principle of justice <\s>
<s> how says the governor of cadiz to general dupont in the same noble letter before alluded to how says he after enumerating the afflictions which his army and the tyrant who had sent it had unjustly brought upon the spanish nation for of these in their dealings with the french they never for a moment lost sight how asks he could you expect that your army should carry off from spain the fruit of its rapacity cruelty and impiety <\s>
<s> how could you conceive this possible or that we should be so stupid or senseless <\s>
<s> and this conduct is as wise in reason as it is true to nature <\s>
<s> the spanish people could have had no confidence in their government if it had not acted thus <\s>
<s> these are the sympathies which prove that a government is paternal that it makes one family with the people besides it is only by such adherence to justice that in times of like commotion popular excesses can either be mitigated or prevented <\s>
<s> if we would be efficient allies of spain nay if we would not run the risk of doing infinite harm these sentiments must not only be ours as a nation but they must pervade the hearts of our ministers and our generals our agents and our ambassadors <\s>
<s> if it be not so they who are sent abroad must either be conscious how unworthy they are and with what unworthy commissions they appear or not if they do feel this then they must hang their heads and blush for their country and themselves if they do not the spaniards must blush for them and revolt from them or what would be ten thousand times more deplorable they must purchase a reconcilement and a communion by a sacrifice of all that is excellent in themselves <\s>
<s> spain must either break down her lofty spirit her animation and fiery courage to run side by side in the same trammels with great britain or she must start off from her intended yoke fellow with contempt and aversion <\s>
<s> this is the alternative and there is no avoiding it <\s>
<s> i have yet to speak of the influence of such concessions upon the french ruler and his army <\s>
<s> with what satanic pride must he have contemplated the devotion of his servants and adherents to their law the steadiness and zeal of their perverse loyalty and the faithfulness with which they stand by him and each other <\s>
<s> how must his heart have distended with false glory while he contrasted these qualities of his subjects with the insensibility and slackness of his british enemies <\s>
<s> this notice has however no especial propriety in this place for as far as concerns bonaparte his pride and depraved confidence may be equally fed by almost all the conditions of this instrument <\s>
<s> but as to his army it is plain that the permission whether it be considered as by an express article formally granted or only involved in the general conditions of the treaty to bear away in triumph the harvest of its crimes must not only have emboldened and exalted it with arrogance and whetted its rapacity but that hereby every soldier of which this army was composed must upon his arrival in his own country have been a seed which would give back plenteously in its kind <\s>
<s> the french are at present a needy people without commerce or manufactures unsettled in their minds and debased in their morals by revolutionary practices and habits of warfare and the youth of the country are rendered desperate by oppression which leaving no choice in their occupation discharges them from all responsibility to their own consciences <\s>
<s> how powerful then must have been the action of such incitements upon a people so circumstanced <\s>
<s> the actual sight and far more the imaginary sight and handling of these treasures magnified by the romantic tales which must have been spread about them would carry into every town and village an antidote for the terrors of conscription and would rouze men like the dreams imported from the new world when the first discoverers and adventurers returned with their ingots and their gold dust their stories and their promises to inflame and madden the avarice of the old <\s>

<s> this notice has however no especial propriety in this place for as far as concerns bonaparte his pride and depraved confidence may be equally fed by almost all the conditions of this instrument <\s>
<s> but as to his army it is plain that the permission whether it be considered as by an express article formally granted or only involved in the general conditions of the treaty to bear away in triumph the harvest of its crimes must not only have emboldened and exalted it with arrogance and whetted its rapacity but that hereby every soldier of which this army was composed must upon his arrival in his own country have been a seed which would give back plenteously in its kind <\s>
<s> the french are at present a needy people without commerce or manufactures unsettled in their minds and debased in their morals by revolutionary practices and habits of warfare and the youth of the country are rendered desperate by oppression which leaving no choice in their occupation discharges them from all responsibility to their own consciences <\s>
<s> how powerful then must have been the action of such incitements upon a people so circumstanced <\s>
<s> the actual sight and far more the imaginary sight and handling of these treasures magnified by the romantic tales which must have been spread about them would carry into every town and village an antidote for the terrors of conscription and would rouze men like the dreams imported from the new world when the first discoverers and adventurers returned with their ingots and their gold dust their stories and their promises to inflame and madden the avarice of the old <\s>
<s> what an effect says the governor of cadiz must it have upon the people he means the spanish people to know that a single soldier was carrying away 2580 livres tournois <\s>
<s> what an effect he might have said also must it have upon the french i direct the reader's attention to this because it seems to have been overlooked and because some of the public journals speaking of the convention and no doubt uttering the sentiments of several of their readers say that they are disgusted with the transaction not because the french have been permitted to carry off a few diamonds or some ingots of silver but because we confessed by consenting to the treaty that an army of 35,000 british troops aided by the portugueze nation was not able to compel 20,000 french to surrender at discretion <\s>
<s> this is indeed the root of the evil as hath been shewn and it is the curse of this treaty that the several parts of it are of such enormity as singly to occupy the attention and to destroy comparison and coexistence <\s>
<s> but the people of great britain are disgusted both with the one and the other <\s>
<s> they bewail the violation of the principle if the value of the things carried off had been in itself trifling their grief and their indignation would have been scarcely less <\s>
<s> but it is manifest from what has been said that it was not trifling and that therefore upon that account as well as upon others this permission was no less impolitic than it was unjust and dishonourable <\s>
<s> in illustrating these articles of the armistice and convention by which the french were both expressly permitted and indirectly enabled to carry off their booty we have already seen that a concession was made which is still more enormous viz <\s>
<s> that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or resident there and all natives of portugal who have accepted situations under the french government c shall have their property of every kind guaranteed to them by the british army <\s>
<s> by articles 16th and 17th their persons are placed under the like protection <\s>
<s> the french article xvi shall be at liberty either to accompany the french army or to remain in portugal and the portugueze article xvii shall not be rendered accountable for their political conduct during the period of the occupation of the country by the french army they all are placed under the protection of the british commanders and shall sustain no injury in their property or persons <\s>
<s> i have animadverted heretofore upon the unprofessional eagerness of our generals to appear in the character of negotiators when the sword would have done them more service than the pen <\s>
<s> but if they had confined themselves to mere military regulations they might indeed with justice have been grievously censured as injudicious commanders whose notion of the honour of armies was of a low pitch and who had no conception of the peculiar nature of the service in which they were engaged but the censure must have stopped here <\s>
<s> whereas by these provisions they have shewn that they have never reflected upon the nature of military authority as contra distinguished from civil <\s>
<s> french example had so far dazzled and blinded them that the french army is suffered to denominate itself the french government and from the whole tenour of these instruments from the preamble and these articles especially it should seem that our generals fancied themselves and their army to be the british government <\s>
<s> for these regulations emanating from a mere military authority are purely civil but of such a kind that no power on earth could confer a right to establish them <\s>
<s> and this trampling upon the most sacred rights this sacrifice of the consciousness of a self preserving principle without which neither societies nor governments can exist is not made by our generals in relation to subjects of their own sovereign but to an independent nation our ally into whose territories we could not have entered but from its confidence in our friendship and good faith <\s>
<s> surely the persons who under the countenance of too high authority have talked so loudly of prejudging this question entirely overlooked or utterly forgot this part of it <\s>
<s> what have these monstrous provisions to do with the relative strength of the two armies or with any point admitting a doubt <\s>
<s> what need here of a court of judicature to settle who were the persons their names are subscribed by their own hands and to determine the quality of the thing <\s>
<s> actions and agents like these exhibited in this connection with each other must of necessity be condemned the moment they are known and to assert the contrary is to maintain that man is a being without understanding and that morality is an empty dream <\s>
<s> and if this condemnation must after this manner follow to utter it is less a duty than a further inevitable consequence from the constitution of human nature <\s>
<s> they who hold that the formal sanction of a court of judicature is in this case required before a people has a right to pass sentence know not to what degree they are enemies to that people and to mankind to what degree selfishness whether arising from their peculiar situation or from other causes has in them prevailed over those faculties which are our common inheritance and cut them off from fellowship with the species <\s>
<s> most deplorable would be the result if it were possible that the injunctions of these men could be obeyed or their remonstrances acknowledged to be just <\s>
<s> for not to mention that if it were not for such prompt decisions of the public voice misdemeanours of men high in office would rarely be accounted for at all we must bear in mind at this crisis that the adversary of all good is hourly and daily extending his ravages and according to such notions of fitness our indignation our sorrow our shame our sense of right and wrong and all those moral affections and powers of the understanding by which alone he can be effectually opposed are to enter upon a long vacation their motion is to be suspended a thing impossible if it could it would be destroyed <\s>
<s> let us now see what language the portugueze speak upon that part of the treaty which has incited me to give vent to these feelings and to assert these truths <\s>
<s> i protest says general friere against article xvii one of the two now under examination because it attempts to tie down the government of this kingdom not to bring to justice and condign punishment those persons who have been notoriously and scandalously disloyal to their prince and the country by joining and serving the french party and even if the english army should be allowed to screen them from the punishment they have deserved still it should not prevent their expulsion whereby this country would no longer have to fear being again betrayed by the same men <\s>
<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>
<s> couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange <\s>
<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>
<s> which amounts to this <\s>
<s> the french are called upon formally to relinquish in favour of the portugueze that to which they never had any right to abandon false claims which they either had a power to enforce or they had not if they departed immediately and had not power the article was nugatory if they remained a day longer and had power there was no security that they would abide by it <\s>
<s> accordingly loud complaints were made that after the date of the convention all kinds of ravages were committed by the french upon lisbon and its neighbourhood and what did it matter whether these were upon the plea of old debts and requisitions or new debts were created more greedily than ever from the consciousness that the time for collecting them was so short <\s>
<s> this article then the only one which is even in shew favourable to the portugueze is in substance nothing inasmuch as in what it is silent upon viz <\s>
<s> that the people of lisbon and its neighbourhood shall not be vexed and oppressed by the french during their stay with new claims and robberies it is grossly cruel or negligent and in that for which it actually stipulates wholly delusive <\s>
<s> it is in fact insulting for the very admission of a formal renunciation of these claims does to a certain degree acknowledge their justice <\s>
<s> the only decent manner of introducing matter to this effect would have been by placing it as a bye clause of a provision that secured the portugueze from further molestations and merely alluding to it as a thing understood of course <\s>
<s> yet from the place which this specious article occupies preceding immediately the 16th and 17th which we have been last considering it is clear that it must have been intended by the french general as honey smeared upon the edge of the cup to make the poison contained in those two more palateable <\s>
<s> thus much for the portugueze and their particular interests <\s>
<s> in one instance a concern of the spanish nation comes directly under notice and that nation also is treated without delicacy or feeling <\s>
<s> for by the 18th article it is agreed that the spaniards 4000 in number who had been disarmed and were confined on ship board in the port of lisbon by the french should be liberated <\s>
<s> and upon what consideration <\s>
<s> not upon their right to be free as having been treacherously and cruelly dealt with by men who were part of a power that was labouring to subjugate their country and in this attempt had committed inhuman crimes against it not even exchanged as soldiers against soldiers but the condition of their emancipation is that the british general engages to obtain of the spaniards to restore such french subjects either military or civil as have been detained in spain without having been taken in battle or in consequence of military operations but on account of the occurrences of the 29th of last may and the days immediately following <\s>
<s> i know not what are exactly the features of the face for which this word serves as a veil i have no register at hand to inform me what these events precisely were but there can be no doubt that it was a time of triumph for liberty and humanity and that the persons for whom these noble minded spaniards were to be exchanged were no other than a horde from among the most abject of the french nation probably those wretches who having never faced either the dangers or the fatigues of war had been most busy in secret preparations or were most conspicuous in open acts of massacre when the streets of madrid a few weeks before had been drenched with the blood of two thousand of her bravest citizens <\s>
<s> yet the liberation of these spaniards upon these terms is recorded in the report of the court of enquiry as one of the advantages which in the contemplation of the generals would result from the convention <\s>
<s> finally if there shall be any doubt article xiv as to the meaning of any article it shall be explained favourably to the french army and hostages article xx of the rank of field officers on the part of the british army and navy shall be furnished for the guarantee of the present convention <\s>
<s> i have now gone through the painful task of examining the most material conditions of the convention of cintra the whole number of the articles is twenty two with three additional ones a long ladder into a deep abyss of infamy need it be said that neglects injuries and insults like these which we have been contemplating come from what quarter they may let them be exhibited towards whom they will must produce not merely mistrust and jealousy but alienation and hatred <\s>

<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>

<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>

<s> thus much for the portugueze and their particular interests <\s>
<s> in one instance a concern of the spanish nation comes directly under notice and that nation also is treated without delicacy or feeling <\s>
<s> for by the 18th article it is agreed that the spaniards 4000 in number who had been disarmed and were confined on ship board in the port of lisbon by the french should be liberated <\s>
<s> and upon what consideration <\s>
<s> not upon their right to be free as having been treacherously and cruelly dealt with by men who were part of a power that was labouring to subjugate their country and in this attempt had committed inhuman crimes against it not even exchanged as soldiers against soldiers but the condition of their emancipation is that the british general engages to obtain of the spaniards to restore such french subjects either military or civil as have been detained in spain without having been taken in battle or in consequence of military operations but on account of the occurrences of the 29th of last may and the days immediately following <\s>
<s> i know not what are exactly the features of the face for which this word serves as a veil i have no register at hand to inform me what these events precisely were but there can be no doubt that it was a time of triumph for liberty and humanity and that the persons for whom these noble minded spaniards were to be exchanged were no other than a horde from among the most abject of the french nation probably those wretches who having never faced either the dangers or the fatigues of war had been most busy in secret preparations or were most conspicuous in open acts of massacre when the streets of madrid a few weeks before had been drenched with the blood of two thousand of her bravest citizens <\s>
<s> yet the liberation of these spaniards upon these terms is recorded in the report of the court of enquiry as one of the advantages which in the contemplation of the generals would result from the convention <\s>
<s> finally if there shall be any doubt article xiv as to the meaning of any article it shall be explained favourably to the french army and hostages article xx of the rank of field officers on the part of the british army and navy shall be furnished for the guarantee of the present convention <\s>
<s> i have now gone through the painful task of examining the most material conditions of the convention of cintra the whole number of the articles is twenty two with three additional ones a long ladder into a deep abyss of infamy need it be said that neglects injuries and insults like these which we have been contemplating come from what quarter they may let them be exhibited towards whom they will must produce not merely mistrust and jealousy but alienation and hatred <\s>
<s> the passions and feelings may be quieted or diverted for a short time but though out of sight or seemingly asleep they must exist and the life which they have received cannot but by a long course of justice and kindness be overcome and destroyed <\s>
<s> but why talk of a long course of justice and kindness when the immediate result must have been so deplorable <\s>
<s> relying upon our humanity our fellow feeling and our justice upon these instant and urgent claims sanctioned by the more mild one of ancient alliance the portugueze people by voices from every part of their land entreated our succour the arrival of a british army upon their coasts was joyfully hailed and the people of the country zealously assisted in landing the troops without which help as a british general has informed us that landing could not have been effected <\s>
<s> and it is in this manner that they are repaid <\s>
<s> to some port between rochefort and l'orient and be at liberty to serve i come to that memorable condition article v that the french army shall carry with it all its equipments that is to say its military chests and carriages attached to the field commissariat and field hospitals or shall be allowed to dispose of such part as the commander in chief may judge it unnecessary to embark <\s>
<s> in like manner all individuals of the army shall be at liberty to dispose of their private property of every description with full security hereafter for the purchasers <\s>
<s> this is expressed still more pointedly in the armistice though the meaning implied in the two articles is precisely the same <\s>
<s> for in the fifth article of the armistice it is agreed provisionally that all those of whom the french army consists shall be conveyed to france with arms and baggage and all their private property of every description no part of which shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> in the convention it is only expressed that they shall be at liberty to depart article ii with arms and baggage and article v to dispose of their private property of every description <\s>
<s> but if they had a right to dispose of it this would include a right to carry it away which was undoubtedly understood by the french general <\s>
<s> and in the armistice it is expressly said that their private property of every description shall be conveyed to france along with their persons <\s>
<s> what then are we to understand by the words their private property of every description <\s>
<s> equipments of the army in general and baggage of individuals had been stipulated for before now we all know that the lawful professional gains and earnings of a soldier must be small that he is not in the habit of carrying about him during actual warfare any accumulation of these or other property and that the ordinary private property which he can be supposed to have a just title to is included under the name of his baggage therefore this was something more and what it was is apparent <\s>
<s> no part of their property says the armistice shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> who does not see in these words the consciousness of guilt an indirect self betraying admission that they had in their hands treasures which might be lawfully taken from them and an anxiety to prevent that act of justice by a positive stipulation <\s>
<s> who does not see on what sort of property the frenchman had his eye that it was not property by right but their possessions their plunder every thing by what means soever acquired that the french army or any individual in it was possessed of <\s>
<s> but it has been urged that the monstrousness of such a supposition precludes this interpretation renders it impossible that it could either be intended by the one party or so understood by the other <\s>
<s> what right they who signed and he who ratified this convention have to shelter themselves under this plea will appear from the 16th and 17th articles <\s>
<s> in these it is stipulated that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or accidentally in the country shall have their property of every kind moveable and immoveable guaranteed to them with liberty of retaining or disposing of it and passing the produce into france the same is stipulated article xvii for such natives of portugal as have sided with the french or occupied situations under the french government <\s>
<s> here then is a direct avowal still more monstrous that every frenchman or native of a country in alliance with france however obnoxious his crimes may have made him and every traitorous portugueze shall have his property guaranteed to him both previously to and after the reinstatement of the portugueze government by the british army <\s>
<s> now let us ask what sense the word property must have had fastened to it in these cases <\s>
<s> must it not necessarily have included all the rewards which the frenchman had received for his iniquity and the traitorous portugueze for his treason <\s>
<s> for no man would bear a part in such oppressions or would be a traitor for nothing and moreover all the rewards which the french could bestow must have been taken from the portugueze extorted from the honest and loyal to be given to the wicked and disloyal these rewards of iniquity must necessarily have been included for on our side no attempt is made at a distinction and on the side of the french the word immoveable is manifestly intended to preclude such a distinction where alone it could have been effectual <\s>
<s> property then here means possessions thus infamously acquired and in the instance of the portugueze the fundamental notion of the word is subverted for a traitor can have no property till the government of his own country has remitted the punishment due to his crimes <\s>
<s> and these wages of guilt which the master by such exactions was enabled to pay and which the servant thus earned are to be guaranteed to him by a british army <\s>
<s> where does there exist a power on earth that could confer this right <\s>
<s> if the portugueze government itself had acted in this manner it would have been guilty of wilful suicide and the nation if it had acted so of high treason against itself <\s>
<s> let it not then be said that the monstrousness of covenanting to convey along with the persons of the french their plunder secures the article from the interpretation which the people of great britain gave and which i have now proved they were bound to give to it but conceding for a moment that it was not intended that the words should bear this sense and that neither in a fair grammatical construction nor as illustrated by other passages or by the general tenour of the document they actually did bear it had not unquestionable voices proclaimed the cruelty and rapacity the acts of sacrilege assassination and robbery by which these treasures had been amassed <\s>
<s> was not the perfidy of the french army and its contempt of moral obligation both as a body and as to the individuals which composed it infamous through europe therefore the concession would signify nothing for our generals by allowing an army of this character to depart with its equipments waggons military chest and baggage had provided abundant means to enable it to carry off whatsoever it desired and thus to elude and frustrate any stipulations which might have been made for compelling it to restore that which had been so iniquitously seized <\s>
<s> and here are we brought back to the fountain head of all this baseness to that apathy and deadness to the principle of justice through the influence of which this army outlawed by its crimes was suffered to depart from the land over which it had so long tyrannized other than as a band of disarmed prisoners i maintain therefore that permission to carry off the booty was distinctly expressed and if it had not been so that the principle of justice could not here be preserved as a violation of it must necessarily have followed from other conditions of the treaty <\s>
<s> sir hew dalrymple himself before the court of inquiry has told us in two letters to generals beresford and friere that such part of the plunder as was in money it would be difficult if not impossible to identify and consequently the french could not be prevented from carrying it away with them <\s>
<s> from the same letters we learn that the french were intending to carry off a considerable part of their plunder by calling it public money and saying that it belonged to the military chest and that their evasions of the article were most shameful and evinced a want of probity and honour which was most disgraceful to them <\s>
<s> if the french had given no other proofs of their want of such virtues than those furnished by this occasion neither the portugueze nor spanish nor british nations would condemn them nor hate them as they now do; nor would this article of the convention have excited such indignation <\s>
<s> for the french by so acting could not deem themselves breaking an engagement no doubt they looked upon themselves as injured that the failure in good faith was on the part of the british and that it was in the lawlessness of power and by a mere quibble that this construction was afterwards put upon the article in question <\s>
<s> widely different from the conduct of the british was that of the spaniards in a like case with high feeling did they abating not a jot or a tittle enforce the principle of justice <\s>
<s> how says the governor of cadiz to general dupont in the same noble letter before alluded to how says he after enumerating the afflictions which his army and the tyrant who had sent it had unjustly brought upon the spanish nation for of these in their dealings with the french they never for a moment lost sight how asks he could you expect that your army should carry off from spain the fruit of its rapacity cruelty and impiety <\s>
<s> how could you conceive this possible or that we should be so stupid or senseless <\s>
<s> and this conduct is as wise in reason as it is true to nature <\s>
<s> the spanish people could have had no confidence in their government if it had not acted thus <\s>
<s> these are the sympathies which prove that a government is paternal that it makes one family with the people besides it is only by such adherence to justice that in times of like commotion popular excesses can either be mitigated or prevented <\s>
<s> if we would be efficient allies of spain nay if we would not run the risk of doing infinite harm these sentiments must not only be ours as a nation but they must pervade the hearts of our ministers and our generals our agents and our ambassadors <\s>
<s> if it be not so they who are sent abroad must either be conscious how unworthy they are and with what unworthy commissions they appear or not if they do feel this then they must hang their heads and blush for their country and themselves if they do not the spaniards must blush for them and revolt from them or what would be ten thousand times more deplorable they must purchase a reconcilement and a communion by a sacrifice of all that is excellent in themselves <\s>
<s> spain must either break down her lofty spirit her animation and fiery courage to run side by side in the same trammels with great britain or she must start off from her intended yoke fellow with contempt and aversion <\s>
<s> this is the alternative and there is no avoiding it <\s>
<s> i have yet to speak of the influence of such concessions upon the french ruler and his army <\s>
<s> with what satanic pride must he have contemplated the devotion of his servants and adherents to their law the steadiness and zeal of their perverse loyalty and the faithfulness with which they stand by him and each other <\s>
<s> how must his heart have distended with false glory while he contrasted these qualities of his subjects with the insensibility and slackness of his british enemies <\s>

<s> spain must either break down her lofty spirit her animation and fiery courage to run side by side in the same trammels with great britain or she must start off from her intended yoke fellow with contempt and aversion <\s>
<s> this is the alternative and there is no avoiding it <\s>
<s> i have yet to speak of the influence of such concessions upon the french ruler and his army <\s>
<s> with what satanic pride must he have contemplated the devotion of his servants and adherents to their law the steadiness and zeal of their perverse loyalty and the faithfulness with which they stand by him and each other <\s>
<s> how must his heart have distended with false glory while he contrasted these qualities of his subjects with the insensibility and slackness of his british enemies <\s>
<s> this notice has however no especial propriety in this place for as far as concerns bonaparte his pride and depraved confidence may be equally fed by almost all the conditions of this instrument <\s>
<s> but as to his army it is plain that the permission whether it be considered as by an express article formally granted or only involved in the general conditions of the treaty to bear away in triumph the harvest of its crimes must not only have emboldened and exalted it with arrogance and whetted its rapacity but that hereby every soldier of which this army was composed must upon his arrival in his own country have been a seed which would give back plenteously in its kind <\s>
<s> the french are at present a needy people without commerce or manufactures unsettled in their minds and debased in their morals by revolutionary practices and habits of warfare and the youth of the country are rendered desperate by oppression which leaving no choice in their occupation discharges them from all responsibility to their own consciences <\s>
<s> how powerful then must have been the action of such incitements upon a people so circumstanced <\s>
<s> the actual sight and far more the imaginary sight and handling of these treasures magnified by the romantic tales which must have been spread about them would carry into every town and village an antidote for the terrors of conscription and would rouze men like the dreams imported from the new world when the first discoverers and adventurers returned with their ingots and their gold dust their stories and their promises to inflame and madden the avarice of the old <\s>
<s> what an effect says the governor of cadiz must it have upon the people he means the spanish people to know that a single soldier was carrying away 2580 livres tournois <\s>
<s> what an effect he might have said also must it have upon the french i direct the reader's attention to this because it seems to have been overlooked and because some of the public journals speaking of the convention and no doubt uttering the sentiments of several of their readers say that they are disgusted with the transaction not because the french have been permitted to carry off a few diamonds or some ingots of silver but because we confessed by consenting to the treaty that an army of 35,000 british troops aided by the portugueze nation was not able to compel 20,000 french to surrender at discretion <\s>
<s> this is indeed the root of the evil as hath been shewn and it is the curse of this treaty that the several parts of it are of such enormity as singly to occupy the attention and to destroy comparison and coexistence <\s>
<s> but the people of great britain are disgusted both with the one and the other <\s>
<s> they bewail the violation of the principle if the value of the things carried off had been in itself trifling their grief and their indignation would have been scarcely less <\s>
<s> but it is manifest from what has been said that it was not trifling and that therefore upon that account as well as upon others this permission was no less impolitic than it was unjust and dishonourable <\s>
<s> in illustrating these articles of the armistice and convention by which the french were both expressly permitted and indirectly enabled to carry off their booty we have already seen that a concession was made which is still more enormous viz <\s>
<s> that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or resident there and all natives of portugal who have accepted situations under the french government c shall have their property of every kind guaranteed to them by the british army <\s>
<s> by articles 16th and 17th their persons are placed under the like protection <\s>
<s> the french article xvi shall be at liberty either to accompany the french army or to remain in portugal and the portugueze article xvii shall not be rendered accountable for their political conduct during the period of the occupation of the country by the french army they all are placed under the protection of the british commanders and shall sustain no injury in their property or persons <\s>
<s> i have animadverted heretofore upon the unprofessional eagerness of our generals to appear in the character of negotiators when the sword would have done them more service than the pen <\s>
<s> but if they had confined themselves to mere military regulations they might indeed with justice have been grievously censured as injudicious commanders whose notion of the honour of armies was of a low pitch and who had no conception of the peculiar nature of the service in which they were engaged but the censure must have stopped here <\s>
<s> whereas by these provisions they have shewn that they have never reflected upon the nature of military authority as contra distinguished from civil <\s>
<s> french example had so far dazzled and blinded them that the french army is suffered to denominate itself the french government and from the whole tenour of these instruments from the preamble and these articles especially it should seem that our generals fancied themselves and their army to be the british government <\s>
<s> for these regulations emanating from a mere military authority are purely civil but of such a kind that no power on earth could confer a right to establish them <\s>
<s> and this trampling upon the most sacred rights this sacrifice of the consciousness of a self preserving principle without which neither societies nor governments can exist is not made by our generals in relation to subjects of their own sovereign but to an independent nation our ally into whose territories we could not have entered but from its confidence in our friendship and good faith <\s>
<s> surely the persons who under the countenance of too high authority have talked so loudly of prejudging this question entirely overlooked or utterly forgot this part of it <\s>
<s> what have these monstrous provisions to do with the relative strength of the two armies or with any point admitting a doubt <\s>
<s> what need here of a court of judicature to settle who were the persons their names are subscribed by their own hands and to determine the quality of the thing <\s>
<s> actions and agents like these exhibited in this connection with each other must of necessity be condemned the moment they are known and to assert the contrary is to maintain that man is a being without understanding and that morality is an empty dream <\s>
<s> and if this condemnation must after this manner follow to utter it is less a duty than a further inevitable consequence from the constitution of human nature <\s>
<s> they who hold that the formal sanction of a court of judicature is in this case required before a people has a right to pass sentence know not to what degree they are enemies to that people and to mankind to what degree selfishness whether arising from their peculiar situation or from other causes has in them prevailed over those faculties which are our common inheritance and cut them off from fellowship with the species <\s>
<s> most deplorable would be the result if it were possible that the injunctions of these men could be obeyed or their remonstrances acknowledged to be just <\s>
<s> for not to mention that if it were not for such prompt decisions of the public voice misdemeanours of men high in office would rarely be accounted for at all we must bear in mind at this crisis that the adversary of all good is hourly and daily extending his ravages and according to such notions of fitness our indignation our sorrow our shame our sense of right and wrong and all those moral affections and powers of the understanding by which alone he can be effectually opposed are to enter upon a long vacation their motion is to be suspended a thing impossible if it could it would be destroyed <\s>
<s> let us now see what language the portugueze speak upon that part of the treaty which has incited me to give vent to these feelings and to assert these truths <\s>
<s> i protest says general friere against article xvii one of the two now under examination because it attempts to tie down the government of this kingdom not to bring to justice and condign punishment those persons who have been notoriously and scandalously disloyal to their prince and the country by joining and serving the french party and even if the english army should be allowed to screen them from the punishment they have deserved still it should not prevent their expulsion whereby this country would no longer have to fear being again betrayed by the same men <\s>
<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>
<s> couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange <\s>
<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>
<s> which amounts to this <\s>
<s> the french are called upon formally to relinquish in favour of the portugueze that to which they never had any right to abandon false claims which they either had a power to enforce or they had not if they departed immediately and had not power the article was nugatory if they remained a day longer and had power there was no security that they would abide by it <\s>
<s> accordingly loud complaints were made that after the date of the convention all kinds of ravages were committed by the french upon lisbon and its neighbourhood and what did it matter whether these were upon the plea of old debts and requisitions or new debts were created more greedily than ever from the consciousness that the time for collecting them was so short <\s>
<s> this article then the only one which is even in shew favourable to the portugueze is in substance nothing inasmuch as in what it is silent upon viz <\s>
<s> that the people of lisbon and its neighbourhood shall not be vexed and oppressed by the french during their stay with new claims and robberies it is grossly cruel or negligent and in that for which it actually stipulates wholly delusive <\s>
<s> it is in fact insulting for the very admission of a formal renunciation of these claims does to a certain degree acknowledge their justice <\s>
<s> the only decent manner of introducing matter to this effect would have been by placing it as a bye clause of a provision that secured the portugueze from further molestations and merely alluding to it as a thing understood of course <\s>
<s> yet from the place which this specious article occupies preceding immediately the 16th and 17th which we have been last considering it is clear that it must have been intended by the french general as honey smeared upon the edge of the cup to make the poison contained in those two more palateable <\s>
<s> thus much for the portugueze and their particular interests <\s>
<s> in one instance a concern of the spanish nation comes directly under notice and that nation also is treated without delicacy or feeling <\s>
<s> for by the 18th article it is agreed that the spaniards 4000 in number who had been disarmed and were confined on ship board in the port of lisbon by the french should be liberated <\s>
<s> and upon what consideration <\s>
<s> not upon their right to be free as having been treacherously and cruelly dealt with by men who were part of a power that was labouring to subjugate their country and in this attempt had committed inhuman crimes against it not even exchanged as soldiers against soldiers but the condition of their emancipation is that the british general engages to obtain of the spaniards to restore such french subjects either military or civil as have been detained in spain without having been taken in battle or in consequence of military operations but on account of the occurrences of the 29th of last may and the days immediately following <\s>
<s> i know not what are exactly the features of the face for which this word serves as a veil i have no register at hand to inform me what these events precisely were but there can be no doubt that it was a time of triumph for liberty and humanity and that the persons for whom these noble minded spaniards were to be exchanged were no other than a horde from among the most abject of the french nation probably those wretches who having never faced either the dangers or the fatigues of war had been most busy in secret preparations or were most conspicuous in open acts of massacre when the streets of madrid a few weeks before had been drenched with the blood of two thousand of her bravest citizens <\s>
<s> yet the liberation of these spaniards upon these terms is recorded in the report of the court of enquiry as one of the advantages which in the contemplation of the generals would result from the convention <\s>
<s> finally if there shall be any doubt article xiv as to the meaning of any article it shall be explained favourably to the french army and hostages article xx of the rank of field officers on the part of the british army and navy shall be furnished for the guarantee of the present convention <\s>
<s> i have now gone through the painful task of examining the most material conditions of the convention of cintra the whole number of the articles is twenty two with three additional ones a long ladder into a deep abyss of infamy need it be said that neglects injuries and insults like these which we have been contemplating come from what quarter they may let them be exhibited towards whom they will must produce not merely mistrust and jealousy but alienation and hatred <\s>

<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>
<s> couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange <\s>
<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>
<s> which amounts to this <\s>
<s> the french are called upon formally to relinquish in favour of the portugueze that to which they never had any right to abandon false claims which they either had a power to enforce or they had not if they departed immediately and had not power the article was nugatory if they remained a day longer and had power there was no security that they would abide by it <\s>
<s> accordingly loud complaints were made that after the date of the convention all kinds of ravages were committed by the french upon lisbon and its neighbourhood and what did it matter whether these were upon the plea of old debts and requisitions or new debts were created more greedily than ever from the consciousness that the time for collecting them was so short <\s>
<s> this article then the only one which is even in shew favourable to the portugueze is in substance nothing inasmuch as in what it is silent upon viz <\s>
<s> that the people of lisbon and its neighbourhood shall not be vexed and oppressed by the french during their stay with new claims and robberies it is grossly cruel or negligent and in that for which it actually stipulates wholly delusive <\s>

<s> thus much for the portugueze and their particular interests <\s>
<s> in one instance a concern of the spanish nation comes directly under notice and that nation also is treated without delicacy or feeling <\s>
<s> for by the 18th article it is agreed that the spaniards 4000 in number who had been disarmed and were confined on ship board in the port of lisbon by the french should be liberated <\s>
<s> and upon what consideration <\s>
<s> not upon their right to be free as having been treacherously and cruelly dealt with by men who were part of a power that was labouring to subjugate their country and in this attempt had committed inhuman crimes against it not even exchanged as soldiers against soldiers but the condition of their emancipation is that the british general engages to obtain of the spaniards to restore such french subjects either military or civil as have been detained in spain without having been taken in battle or in consequence of military operations but on account of the occurrences of the 29th of last may and the days immediately following <\s>
<s> i know not what are exactly the features of the face for which this word serves as a veil i have no register at hand to inform me what these events precisely were but there can be no doubt that it was a time of triumph for liberty and humanity and that the persons for whom these noble minded spaniards were to be exchanged were no other than a horde from among the most abject of the french nation probably those wretches who having never faced either the dangers or the fatigues of war had been most busy in secret preparations or were most conspicuous in open acts of massacre when the streets of madrid a few weeks before had been drenched with the blood of two thousand of her bravest citizens <\s>
<s> yet the liberation of these spaniards upon these terms is recorded in the report of the court of enquiry as one of the advantages which in the contemplation of the generals would result from the convention <\s>
<s> finally if there shall be any doubt article xiv as to the meaning of any article it shall be explained favourably to the french army and hostages article xx of the rank of field officers on the part of the british army and navy shall be furnished for the guarantee of the present convention <\s>
<s> i have now gone through the painful task of examining the most material conditions of the convention of cintra the whole number of the articles is twenty two with three additional ones a long ladder into a deep abyss of infamy need it be said that neglects injuries and insults like these which we have been contemplating come from what quarter they may let them be exhibited towards whom they will must produce not merely mistrust and jealousy but alienation and hatred <\s>
<s> the passions and feelings may be quieted or diverted for a short time but though out of sight or seemingly asleep they must exist and the life which they have received cannot but by a long course of justice and kindness be overcome and destroyed <\s>
<s> but why talk of a long course of justice and kindness when the immediate result must have been so deplorable <\s>
<s> relying upon our humanity our fellow feeling and our justice upon these instant and urgent claims sanctioned by the more mild one of ancient alliance the portugueze people by voices from every part of their land entreated our succour the arrival of a british army upon their coasts was joyfully hailed and the people of the country zealously assisted in landing the troops without which help as a british general has informed us that landing could not have been effected <\s>
<s> and it is in this manner that they are repaid <\s>
<s> to some port between rochefort and l'orient and be at liberty to serve i come to that memorable condition article v that the french army shall carry with it all its equipments that is to say its military chests and carriages attached to the field commissariat and field hospitals or shall be allowed to dispose of such part as the commander in chief may judge it unnecessary to embark <\s>
<s> in like manner all individuals of the army shall be at liberty to dispose of their private property of every description with full security hereafter for the purchasers <\s>
<s> this is expressed still more pointedly in the armistice though the meaning implied in the two articles is precisely the same <\s>
<s> for in the fifth article of the armistice it is agreed provisionally that all those of whom the french army consists shall be conveyed to france with arms and baggage and all their private property of every description no part of which shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> in the convention it is only expressed that they shall be at liberty to depart article ii with arms and baggage and article v to dispose of their private property of every description <\s>
<s> but if they had a right to dispose of it this would include a right to carry it away which was undoubtedly understood by the french general <\s>
<s> and in the armistice it is expressly said that their private property of every description shall be conveyed to france along with their persons <\s>
<s> what then are we to understand by the words their private property of every description <\s>
<s> equipments of the army in general and baggage of individuals had been stipulated for before now we all know that the lawful professional gains and earnings of a soldier must be small that he is not in the habit of carrying about him during actual warfare any accumulation of these or other property and that the ordinary private property which he can be supposed to have a just title to is included under the name of his baggage therefore this was something more and what it was is apparent <\s>
<s> no part of their property says the armistice shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> who does not see in these words the consciousness of guilt an indirect self betraying admission that they had in their hands treasures which might be lawfully taken from them and an anxiety to prevent that act of justice by a positive stipulation <\s>
<s> who does not see on what sort of property the frenchman had his eye that it was not property by right but their possessions their plunder every thing by what means soever acquired that the french army or any individual in it was possessed of <\s>
<s> but it has been urged that the monstrousness of such a supposition precludes this interpretation renders it impossible that it could either be intended by the one party or so understood by the other <\s>
<s> what right they who signed and he who ratified this convention have to shelter themselves under this plea will appear from the 16th and 17th articles <\s>
<s> in these it is stipulated that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or accidentally in the country shall have their property of every kind moveable and immoveable guaranteed to them with liberty of retaining or disposing of it and passing the produce into france the same is stipulated article xvii for such natives of portugal as have sided with the french or occupied situations under the french government <\s>
<s> here then is a direct avowal still more monstrous that every frenchman or native of a country in alliance with france however obnoxious his crimes may have made him and every traitorous portugueze shall have his property guaranteed to him both previously to and after the reinstatement of the portugueze government by the british army <\s>
<s> now let us ask what sense the word property must have had fastened to it in these cases <\s>
<s> must it not necessarily have included all the rewards which the frenchman had received for his iniquity and the traitorous portugueze for his treason <\s>
<s> for no man would bear a part in such oppressions or would be a traitor for nothing and moreover all the rewards which the french could bestow must have been taken from the portugueze extorted from the honest and loyal to be given to the wicked and disloyal these rewards of iniquity must necessarily have been included for on our side no attempt is made at a distinction and on the side of the french the word immoveable is manifestly intended to preclude such a distinction where alone it could have been effectual <\s>
<s> property then here means possessions thus infamously acquired and in the instance of the portugueze the fundamental notion of the word is subverted for a traitor can have no property till the government of his own country has remitted the punishment due to his crimes <\s>
<s> and these wages of guilt which the master by such exactions was enabled to pay and which the servant thus earned are to be guaranteed to him by a british army <\s>
<s> where does there exist a power on earth that could confer this right <\s>
<s> if the portugueze government itself had acted in this manner it would have been guilty of wilful suicide and the nation if it had acted so of high treason against itself <\s>
<s> let it not then be said that the monstrousness of covenanting to convey along with the persons of the french their plunder secures the article from the interpretation which the people of great britain gave and which i have now proved they were bound to give to it but conceding for a moment that it was not intended that the words should bear this sense and that neither in a fair grammatical construction nor as illustrated by other passages or by the general tenour of the document they actually did bear it had not unquestionable voices proclaimed the cruelty and rapacity the acts of sacrilege assassination and robbery by which these treasures had been amassed <\s>
<s> was not the perfidy of the french army and its contempt of moral obligation both as a body and as to the individuals which composed it infamous through europe therefore the concession would signify nothing for our generals by allowing an army of this character to depart with its equipments waggons military chest and baggage had provided abundant means to enable it to carry off whatsoever it desired and thus to elude and frustrate any stipulations which might have been made for compelling it to restore that which had been so iniquitously seized <\s>
<s> and here are we brought back to the fountain head of all this baseness to that apathy and deadness to the principle of justice through the influence of which this army outlawed by its crimes was suffered to depart from the land over which it had so long tyrannized other than as a band of disarmed prisoners i maintain therefore that permission to carry off the booty was distinctly expressed and if it had not been so that the principle of justice could not here be preserved as a violation of it must necessarily have followed from other conditions of the treaty <\s>
<s> sir hew dalrymple himself before the court of inquiry has told us in two letters to generals beresford and friere that such part of the plunder as was in money it would be difficult if not impossible to identify and consequently the french could not be prevented from carrying it away with them <\s>
<s> from the same letters we learn that the french were intending to carry off a considerable part of their plunder by calling it public money and saying that it belonged to the military chest and that their evasions of the article were most shameful and evinced a want of probity and honour which was most disgraceful to them <\s>
<s> if the french had given no other proofs of their want of such virtues than those furnished by this occasion neither the portugueze nor spanish nor british nations would condemn them nor hate them as they now do; nor would this article of the convention have excited such indignation <\s>
<s> for the french by so acting could not deem themselves breaking an engagement no doubt they looked upon themselves as injured that the failure in good faith was on the part of the british and that it was in the lawlessness of power and by a mere quibble that this construction was afterwards put upon the article in question <\s>
<s> widely different from the conduct of the british was that of the spaniards in a like case with high feeling did they abating not a jot or a tittle enforce the principle of justice <\s>
<s> how says the governor of cadiz to general dupont in the same noble letter before alluded to how says he after enumerating the afflictions which his army and the tyrant who had sent it had unjustly brought upon the spanish nation for of these in their dealings with the french they never for a moment lost sight how asks he could you expect that your army should carry off from spain the fruit of its rapacity cruelty and impiety <\s>
<s> how could you conceive this possible or that we should be so stupid or senseless <\s>
<s> and this conduct is as wise in reason as it is true to nature <\s>
<s> the spanish people could have had no confidence in their government if it had not acted thus <\s>
<s> these are the sympathies which prove that a government is paternal that it makes one family with the people besides it is only by such adherence to justice that in times of like commotion popular excesses can either be mitigated or prevented <\s>
<s> if we would be efficient allies of spain nay if we would not run the risk of doing infinite harm these sentiments must not only be ours as a nation but they must pervade the hearts of our ministers and our generals our agents and our ambassadors <\s>

<s> widely different from the conduct of the british was that of the spaniards in a like case with high feeling did they abating not a jot or a tittle enforce the principle of justice <\s>

<s> how could you conceive this possible or that we should be so stupid or senseless <\s>
<s> and this conduct is as wise in reason as it is true to nature <\s>

<s> if we would be efficient allies of spain nay if we would not run the risk of doing infinite harm these sentiments must not only be ours as a nation but they must pervade the hearts of our ministers and our generals our agents and our ambassadors <\s>

<s> spain must either break down her lofty spirit her animation and fiery courage to run side by side in the same trammels with great britain or she must start off from her intended yoke fellow with contempt and aversion <\s>
<s> this is the alternative and there is no avoiding it <\s>
<s> i have yet to speak of the influence of such concessions upon the french ruler and his army <\s>
<s> with what satanic pride must he have contemplated the devotion of his servants and adherents to their law the steadiness and zeal of their perverse loyalty and the faithfulness with which they stand by him and each other <\s>
<s> how must his heart have distended with false glory while he contrasted these qualities of his subjects with the insensibility and slackness of his british enemies <\s>
<s> this notice has however no especial propriety in this place for as far as concerns bonaparte his pride and depraved confidence may be equally fed by almost all the conditions of this instrument <\s>
<s> but as to his army it is plain that the permission whether it be considered as by an express article formally granted or only involved in the general conditions of the treaty to bear away in triumph the harvest of its crimes must not only have emboldened and exalted it with arrogance and whetted its rapacity but that hereby every soldier of which this army was composed must upon his arrival in his own country have been a seed which would give back plenteously in its kind <\s>
<s> the french are at present a needy people without commerce or manufactures unsettled in their minds and debased in their morals by revolutionary practices and habits of warfare and the youth of the country are rendered desperate by oppression which leaving no choice in their occupation discharges them from all responsibility to their own consciences <\s>
<s> how powerful then must have been the action of such incitements upon a people so circumstanced <\s>
<s> the actual sight and far more the imaginary sight and handling of these treasures magnified by the romantic tales which must have been spread about them would carry into every town and village an antidote for the terrors of conscription and would rouze men like the dreams imported from the new world when the first discoverers and adventurers returned with their ingots and their gold dust their stories and their promises to inflame and madden the avarice of the old <\s>
<s> what an effect says the governor of cadiz must it have upon the people he means the spanish people to know that a single soldier was carrying away 2580 livres tournois <\s>
<s> what an effect he might have said also must it have upon the french i direct the reader's attention to this because it seems to have been overlooked and because some of the public journals speaking of the convention and no doubt uttering the sentiments of several of their readers say that they are disgusted with the transaction not because the french have been permitted to carry off a few diamonds or some ingots of silver but because we confessed by consenting to the treaty that an army of 35,000 british troops aided by the portugueze nation was not able to compel 20,000 french to surrender at discretion <\s>
<s> this is indeed the root of the evil as hath been shewn and it is the curse of this treaty that the several parts of it are of such enormity as singly to occupy the attention and to destroy comparison and coexistence <\s>
<s> but the people of great britain are disgusted both with the one and the other <\s>
<s> they bewail the violation of the principle if the value of the things carried off had been in itself trifling their grief and their indignation would have been scarcely less <\s>
<s> but it is manifest from what has been said that it was not trifling and that therefore upon that account as well as upon others this permission was no less impolitic than it was unjust and dishonourable <\s>
<s> in illustrating these articles of the armistice and convention by which the french were both expressly permitted and indirectly enabled to carry off their booty we have already seen that a concession was made which is still more enormous viz <\s>
<s> that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or resident there and all natives of portugal who have accepted situations under the french government c shall have their property of every kind guaranteed to them by the british army <\s>
<s> by articles 16th and 17th their persons are placed under the like protection <\s>
<s> the french article xvi shall be at liberty either to accompany the french army or to remain in portugal and the portugueze article xvii shall not be rendered accountable for their political conduct during the period of the occupation of the country by the french army they all are placed under the protection of the british commanders and shall sustain no injury in their property or persons <\s>
<s> i have animadverted heretofore upon the unprofessional eagerness of our generals to appear in the character of negotiators when the sword would have done them more service than the pen <\s>
<s> but if they had confined themselves to mere military regulations they might indeed with justice have been grievously censured as injudicious commanders whose notion of the honour of armies was of a low pitch and who had no conception of the peculiar nature of the service in which they were engaged but the censure must have stopped here <\s>
<s> whereas by these provisions they have shewn that they have never reflected upon the nature of military authority as contra distinguished from civil <\s>
<s> french example had so far dazzled and blinded them that the french army is suffered to denominate itself the french government and from the whole tenour of these instruments from the preamble and these articles especially it should seem that our generals fancied themselves and their army to be the british government <\s>
<s> for these regulations emanating from a mere military authority are purely civil but of such a kind that no power on earth could confer a right to establish them <\s>
<s> and this trampling upon the most sacred rights this sacrifice of the consciousness of a self preserving principle without which neither societies nor governments can exist is not made by our generals in relation to subjects of their own sovereign but to an independent nation our ally into whose territories we could not have entered but from its confidence in our friendship and good faith <\s>
<s> surely the persons who under the countenance of too high authority have talked so loudly of prejudging this question entirely overlooked or utterly forgot this part of it <\s>
<s> what have these monstrous provisions to do with the relative strength of the two armies or with any point admitting a doubt <\s>
<s> what need here of a court of judicature to settle who were the persons their names are subscribed by their own hands and to determine the quality of the thing <\s>
<s> actions and agents like these exhibited in this connection with each other must of necessity be condemned the moment they are known and to assert the contrary is to maintain that man is a being without understanding and that morality is an empty dream <\s>
<s> and if this condemnation must after this manner follow to utter it is less a duty than a further inevitable consequence from the constitution of human nature <\s>
<s> they who hold that the formal sanction of a court of judicature is in this case required before a people has a right to pass sentence know not to what degree they are enemies to that people and to mankind to what degree selfishness whether arising from their peculiar situation or from other causes has in them prevailed over those faculties which are our common inheritance and cut them off from fellowship with the species <\s>
<s> most deplorable would be the result if it were possible that the injunctions of these men could be obeyed or their remonstrances acknowledged to be just <\s>
<s> for not to mention that if it were not for such prompt decisions of the public voice misdemeanours of men high in office would rarely be accounted for at all we must bear in mind at this crisis that the adversary of all good is hourly and daily extending his ravages and according to such notions of fitness our indignation our sorrow our shame our sense of right and wrong and all those moral affections and powers of the understanding by which alone he can be effectually opposed are to enter upon a long vacation their motion is to be suspended a thing impossible if it could it would be destroyed <\s>
<s> let us now see what language the portugueze speak upon that part of the treaty which has incited me to give vent to these feelings and to assert these truths <\s>
<s> i protest says general friere against article xvii one of the two now under examination because it attempts to tie down the government of this kingdom not to bring to justice and condign punishment those persons who have been notoriously and scandalously disloyal to their prince and the country by joining and serving the french party and even if the english army should be allowed to screen them from the punishment they have deserved still it should not prevent their expulsion whereby this country would no longer have to fear being again betrayed by the same men <\s>
<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>
<s> couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange <\s>
<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>
<s> which amounts to this <\s>
<s> the french are called upon formally to relinquish in favour of the portugueze that to which they never had any right to abandon false claims which they either had a power to enforce or they had not if they departed immediately and had not power the article was nugatory if they remained a day longer and had power there was no security that they would abide by it <\s>
<s> accordingly loud complaints were made that after the date of the convention all kinds of ravages were committed by the french upon lisbon and its neighbourhood and what did it matter whether these were upon the plea of old debts and requisitions or new debts were created more greedily than ever from the consciousness that the time for collecting them was so short <\s>
<s> this article then the only one which is even in shew favourable to the portugueze is in substance nothing inasmuch as in what it is silent upon viz <\s>
<s> that the people of lisbon and its neighbourhood shall not be vexed and oppressed by the french during their stay with new claims and robberies it is grossly cruel or negligent and in that for which it actually stipulates wholly delusive <\s>
<s> it is in fact insulting for the very admission of a formal renunciation of these claims does to a certain degree acknowledge their justice <\s>
<s> the only decent manner of introducing matter to this effect would have been by placing it as a bye clause of a provision that secured the portugueze from further molestations and merely alluding to it as a thing understood of course <\s>
<s> yet from the place which this specious article occupies preceding immediately the 16th and 17th which we have been last considering it is clear that it must have been intended by the french general as honey smeared upon the edge of the cup to make the poison contained in those two more palateable <\s>

<s> let us now see what language the portugueze speak upon that part of the treaty which has incited me to give vent to these feelings and to assert these truths <\s>
<s> i protest says general friere against article xvii one of the two now under examination because it attempts to tie down the government of this kingdom not to bring to justice and condign punishment those persons who have been notoriously and scandalously disloyal to their prince and the country by joining and serving the french party and even if the english army should be allowed to screen them from the punishment they have deserved still it should not prevent their expulsion whereby this country would no longer have to fear being again betrayed by the same men <\s>
<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>
<s> couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange <\s>
<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>
<s> which amounts to this <\s>
<s> the french are called upon formally to relinquish in favour of the portugueze that to which they never had any right to abandon false claims which they either had a power to enforce or they had not if they departed immediately and had not power the article was nugatory if they remained a day longer and had power there was no security that they would abide by it <\s>
<s> accordingly loud complaints were made that after the date of the convention all kinds of ravages were committed by the french upon lisbon and its neighbourhood and what did it matter whether these were upon the plea of old debts and requisitions or new debts were created more greedily than ever from the consciousness that the time for collecting them was so short <\s>
<s> this article then the only one which is even in shew favourable to the portugueze is in substance nothing inasmuch as in what it is silent upon viz <\s>
<s> that the people of lisbon and its neighbourhood shall not be vexed and oppressed by the french during their stay with new claims and robberies it is grossly cruel or negligent and in that for which it actually stipulates wholly delusive <\s>
<s> it is in fact insulting for the very admission of a formal renunciation of these claims does to a certain degree acknowledge their justice <\s>
<s> the only decent manner of introducing matter to this effect would have been by placing it as a bye clause of a provision that secured the portugueze from further molestations and merely alluding to it as a thing understood of course <\s>
<s> yet from the place which this specious article occupies preceding immediately the 16th and 17th which we have been last considering it is clear that it must have been intended by the french general as honey smeared upon the edge of the cup to make the poison contained in those two more palateable <\s>
<s> thus much for the portugueze and their particular interests <\s>
<s> in one instance a concern of the spanish nation comes directly under notice and that nation also is treated without delicacy or feeling <\s>
<s> for by the 18th article it is agreed that the spaniards 4000 in number who had been disarmed and were confined on ship board in the port of lisbon by the french should be liberated <\s>
<s> and upon what consideration <\s>
<s> not upon their right to be free as having been treacherously and cruelly dealt with by men who were part of a power that was labouring to subjugate their country and in this attempt had committed inhuman crimes against it not even exchanged as soldiers against soldiers but the condition of their emancipation is that the british general engages to obtain of the spaniards to restore such french subjects either military or civil as have been detained in spain without having been taken in battle or in consequence of military operations but on account of the occurrences of the 29th of last may and the days immediately following <\s>
<s> i know not what are exactly the features of the face for which this word serves as a veil i have no register at hand to inform me what these events precisely were but there can be no doubt that it was a time of triumph for liberty and humanity and that the persons for whom these noble minded spaniards were to be exchanged were no other than a horde from among the most abject of the french nation probably those wretches who having never faced either the dangers or the fatigues of war had been most busy in secret preparations or were most conspicuous in open acts of massacre when the streets of madrid a few weeks before had been drenched with the blood of two thousand of her bravest citizens <\s>
<s> yet the liberation of these spaniards upon these terms is recorded in the report of the court of enquiry as one of the advantages which in the contemplation of the generals would result from the convention <\s>
<s> finally if there shall be any doubt article xiv as to the meaning of any article it shall be explained favourably to the french army and hostages article xx of the rank of field officers on the part of the british army and navy shall be furnished for the guarantee of the present convention <\s>
<s> i have now gone through the painful task of examining the most material conditions of the convention of cintra the whole number of the articles is twenty two with three additional ones a long ladder into a deep abyss of infamy need it be said that neglects injuries and insults like these which we have been contemplating come from what quarter they may let them be exhibited towards whom they will must produce not merely mistrust and jealousy but alienation and hatred <\s>
<s> the passions and feelings may be quieted or diverted for a short time but though out of sight or seemingly asleep they must exist and the life which they have received cannot but by a long course of justice and kindness be overcome and destroyed <\s>
<s> but why talk of a long course of justice and kindness when the immediate result must have been so deplorable <\s>
<s> relying upon our humanity our fellow feeling and our justice upon these instant and urgent claims sanctioned by the more mild one of ancient alliance the portugueze people by voices from every part of their land entreated our succour the arrival of a british army upon their coasts was joyfully hailed and the people of the country zealously assisted in landing the troops without which help as a british general has informed us that landing could not have been effected <\s>
<s> and it is in this manner that they are repaid <\s>
<s> to some port between rochefort and l'orient and be at liberty to serve i come to that memorable condition article v that the french army shall carry with it all its equipments that is to say its military chests and carriages attached to the field commissariat and field hospitals or shall be allowed to dispose of such part as the commander in chief may judge it unnecessary to embark <\s>
<s> in like manner all individuals of the army shall be at liberty to dispose of their private property of every description with full security hereafter for the purchasers <\s>
<s> this is expressed still more pointedly in the armistice though the meaning implied in the two articles is precisely the same <\s>
<s> for in the fifth article of the armistice it is agreed provisionally that all those of whom the french army consists shall be conveyed to france with arms and baggage and all their private property of every description no part of which shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> in the convention it is only expressed that they shall be at liberty to depart article ii with arms and baggage and article v to dispose of their private property of every description <\s>
<s> but if they had a right to dispose of it this would include a right to carry it away which was undoubtedly understood by the french general <\s>
<s> and in the armistice it is expressly said that their private property of every description shall be conveyed to france along with their persons <\s>
<s> what then are we to understand by the words their private property of every description <\s>
<s> equipments of the army in general and baggage of individuals had been stipulated for before now we all know that the lawful professional gains and earnings of a soldier must be small that he is not in the habit of carrying about him during actual warfare any accumulation of these or other property and that the ordinary private property which he can be supposed to have a just title to is included under the name of his baggage therefore this was something more and what it was is apparent <\s>
<s> no part of their property says the armistice shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> who does not see in these words the consciousness of guilt an indirect self betraying admission that they had in their hands treasures which might be lawfully taken from them and an anxiety to prevent that act of justice by a positive stipulation <\s>
<s> who does not see on what sort of property the frenchman had his eye that it was not property by right but their possessions their plunder every thing by what means soever acquired that the french army or any individual in it was possessed of <\s>
<s> but it has been urged that the monstrousness of such a supposition precludes this interpretation renders it impossible that it could either be intended by the one party or so understood by the other <\s>
<s> what right they who signed and he who ratified this convention have to shelter themselves under this plea will appear from the 16th and 17th articles <\s>
<s> in these it is stipulated that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or accidentally in the country shall have their property of every kind moveable and immoveable guaranteed to them with liberty of retaining or disposing of it and passing the produce into france the same is stipulated article xvii for such natives of portugal as have sided with the french or occupied situations under the french government <\s>
<s> here then is a direct avowal still more monstrous that every frenchman or native of a country in alliance with france however obnoxious his crimes may have made him and every traitorous portugueze shall have his property guaranteed to him both previously to and after the reinstatement of the portugueze government by the british army <\s>
<s> now let us ask what sense the word property must have had fastened to it in these cases <\s>
<s> must it not necessarily have included all the rewards which the frenchman had received for his iniquity and the traitorous portugueze for his treason <\s>
<s> for no man would bear a part in such oppressions or would be a traitor for nothing and moreover all the rewards which the french could bestow must have been taken from the portugueze extorted from the honest and loyal to be given to the wicked and disloyal these rewards of iniquity must necessarily have been included for on our side no attempt is made at a distinction and on the side of the french the word immoveable is manifestly intended to preclude such a distinction where alone it could have been effectual <\s>
<s> property then here means possessions thus infamously acquired and in the instance of the portugueze the fundamental notion of the word is subverted for a traitor can have no property till the government of his own country has remitted the punishment due to his crimes <\s>
<s> and these wages of guilt which the master by such exactions was enabled to pay and which the servant thus earned are to be guaranteed to him by a british army <\s>
<s> where does there exist a power on earth that could confer this right <\s>
<s> if the portugueze government itself had acted in this manner it would have been guilty of wilful suicide and the nation if it had acted so of high treason against itself <\s>
<s> let it not then be said that the monstrousness of covenanting to convey along with the persons of the french their plunder secures the article from the interpretation which the people of great britain gave and which i have now proved they were bound to give to it but conceding for a moment that it was not intended that the words should bear this sense and that neither in a fair grammatical construction nor as illustrated by other passages or by the general tenour of the document they actually did bear it had not unquestionable voices proclaimed the cruelty and rapacity the acts of sacrilege assassination and robbery by which these treasures had been amassed <\s>
<s> was not the perfidy of the french army and its contempt of moral obligation both as a body and as to the individuals which composed it infamous through europe therefore the concession would signify nothing for our generals by allowing an army of this character to depart with its equipments waggons military chest and baggage had provided abundant means to enable it to carry off whatsoever it desired and thus to elude and frustrate any stipulations which might have been made for compelling it to restore that which had been so iniquitously seized <\s>
<s> and here are we brought back to the fountain head of all this baseness to that apathy and deadness to the principle of justice through the influence of which this army outlawed by its crimes was suffered to depart from the land over which it had so long tyrannized other than as a band of disarmed prisoners i maintain therefore that permission to carry off the booty was distinctly expressed and if it had not been so that the principle of justice could not here be preserved as a violation of it must necessarily have followed from other conditions of the treaty <\s>
<s> sir hew dalrymple himself before the court of inquiry has told us in two letters to generals beresford and friere that such part of the plunder as was in money it would be difficult if not impossible to identify and consequently the french could not be prevented from carrying it away with them <\s>
<s> from the same letters we learn that the french were intending to carry off a considerable part of their plunder by calling it public money and saying that it belonged to the military chest and that their evasions of the article were most shameful and evinced a want of probity and honour which was most disgraceful to them <\s>
<s> if the french had given no other proofs of their want of such virtues than those furnished by this occasion neither the portugueze nor spanish nor british nations would condemn them nor hate them as they now do; nor would this article of the convention have excited such indignation <\s>
<s> for the french by so acting could not deem themselves breaking an engagement no doubt they looked upon themselves as injured that the failure in good faith was on the part of the british and that it was in the lawlessness of power and by a mere quibble that this construction was afterwards put upon the article in question <\s>
<s> widely different from the conduct of the british was that of the spaniards in a like case with high feeling did they abating not a jot or a tittle enforce the principle of justice <\s>
<s> how says the governor of cadiz to general dupont in the same noble letter before alluded to how says he after enumerating the afflictions which his army and the tyrant who had sent it had unjustly brought upon the spanish nation for of these in their dealings with the french they never for a moment lost sight how asks he could you expect that your army should carry off from spain the fruit of its rapacity cruelty and impiety <\s>

<s> widely different from the conduct of the british was that of the spaniards in a like case with high feeling did they abating not a jot or a tittle enforce the principle of justice <\s>
<s> how says the governor of cadiz to general dupont in the same noble letter before alluded to how says he after enumerating the afflictions which his army and the tyrant who had sent it had unjustly brought upon the spanish nation for of these in their dealings with the french they never for a moment lost sight how asks he could you expect that your army should carry off from spain the fruit of its rapacity cruelty and impiety <\s>
<s> how could you conceive this possible or that we should be so stupid or senseless <\s>
<s> and this conduct is as wise in reason as it is true to nature <\s>
<s> the spanish people could have had no confidence in their government if it had not acted thus <\s>
<s> these are the sympathies which prove that a government is paternal that it makes one family with the people besides it is only by such adherence to justice that in times of like commotion popular excesses can either be mitigated or prevented <\s>
<s> if we would be efficient allies of spain nay if we would not run the risk of doing infinite harm these sentiments must not only be ours as a nation but they must pervade the hearts of our ministers and our generals our agents and our ambassadors <\s>
<s> if it be not so they who are sent abroad must either be conscious how unworthy they are and with what unworthy commissions they appear or not if they do feel this then they must hang their heads and blush for their country and themselves if they do not the spaniards must blush for them and revolt from them or what would be ten thousand times more deplorable they must purchase a reconcilement and a communion by a sacrifice of all that is excellent in themselves <\s>
<s> spain must either break down her lofty spirit her animation and fiery courage to run side by side in the same trammels with great britain or she must start off from her intended yoke fellow with contempt and aversion <\s>
<s> this is the alternative and there is no avoiding it <\s>
<s> i have yet to speak of the influence of such concessions upon the french ruler and his army <\s>
<s> with what satanic pride must he have contemplated the devotion of his servants and adherents to their law the steadiness and zeal of their perverse loyalty and the faithfulness with which they stand by him and each other <\s>
<s> how must his heart have distended with false glory while he contrasted these qualities of his subjects with the insensibility and slackness of his british enemies <\s>
<s> this notice has however no especial propriety in this place for as far as concerns bonaparte his pride and depraved confidence may be equally fed by almost all the conditions of this instrument <\s>
<s> but as to his army it is plain that the permission whether it be considered as by an express article formally granted or only involved in the general conditions of the treaty to bear away in triumph the harvest of its crimes must not only have emboldened and exalted it with arrogance and whetted its rapacity but that hereby every soldier of which this army was composed must upon his arrival in his own country have been a seed which would give back plenteously in its kind <\s>
<s> the french are at present a needy people without commerce or manufactures unsettled in their minds and debased in their morals by revolutionary practices and habits of warfare and the youth of the country are rendered desperate by oppression which leaving no choice in their occupation discharges them from all responsibility to their own consciences <\s>
<s> how powerful then must have been the action of such incitements upon a people so circumstanced <\s>
<s> the actual sight and far more the imaginary sight and handling of these treasures magnified by the romantic tales which must have been spread about them would carry into every town and village an antidote for the terrors of conscription and would rouze men like the dreams imported from the new world when the first discoverers and adventurers returned with their ingots and their gold dust their stories and their promises to inflame and madden the avarice of the old <\s>
<s> what an effect says the governor of cadiz must it have upon the people he means the spanish people to know that a single soldier was carrying away 2580 livres tournois <\s>
<s> what an effect he might have said also must it have upon the french i direct the reader's attention to this because it seems to have been overlooked and because some of the public journals speaking of the convention and no doubt uttering the sentiments of several of their readers say that they are disgusted with the transaction not because the french have been permitted to carry off a few diamonds or some ingots of silver but because we confessed by consenting to the treaty that an army of 35,000 british troops aided by the portugueze nation was not able to compel 20,000 french to surrender at discretion <\s>
<s> this is indeed the root of the evil as hath been shewn and it is the curse of this treaty that the several parts of it are of such enormity as singly to occupy the attention and to destroy comparison and coexistence <\s>
<s> but the people of great britain are disgusted both with the one and the other <\s>
<s> they bewail the violation of the principle if the value of the things carried off had been in itself trifling their grief and their indignation would have been scarcely less <\s>
<s> but it is manifest from what has been said that it was not trifling and that therefore upon that account as well as upon others this permission was no less impolitic than it was unjust and dishonourable <\s>
<s> in illustrating these articles of the armistice and convention by which the french were both expressly permitted and indirectly enabled to carry off their booty we have already seen that a concession was made which is still more enormous viz <\s>
<s> that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or resident there and all natives of portugal who have accepted situations under the french government c shall have their property of every kind guaranteed to them by the british army <\s>
<s> by articles 16th and 17th their persons are placed under the like protection <\s>
<s> the french article xvi shall be at liberty either to accompany the french army or to remain in portugal and the portugueze article xvii shall not be rendered accountable for their political conduct during the period of the occupation of the country by the french army they all are placed under the protection of the british commanders and shall sustain no injury in their property or persons <\s>
<s> i have animadverted heretofore upon the unprofessional eagerness of our generals to appear in the character of negotiators when the sword would have done them more service than the pen <\s>
<s> but if they had confined themselves to mere military regulations they might indeed with justice have been grievously censured as injudicious commanders whose notion of the honour of armies was of a low pitch and who had no conception of the peculiar nature of the service in which they were engaged but the censure must have stopped here <\s>
<s> whereas by these provisions they have shewn that they have never reflected upon the nature of military authority as contra distinguished from civil <\s>
<s> french example had so far dazzled and blinded them that the french army is suffered to denominate itself the french government and from the whole tenour of these instruments from the preamble and these articles especially it should seem that our generals fancied themselves and their army to be the british government <\s>
<s> for these regulations emanating from a mere military authority are purely civil but of such a kind that no power on earth could confer a right to establish them <\s>
<s> and this trampling upon the most sacred rights this sacrifice of the consciousness of a self preserving principle without which neither societies nor governments can exist is not made by our generals in relation to subjects of their own sovereign but to an independent nation our ally into whose territories we could not have entered but from its confidence in our friendship and good faith <\s>
<s> surely the persons who under the countenance of too high authority have talked so loudly of prejudging this question entirely overlooked or utterly forgot this part of it <\s>
<s> what have these monstrous provisions to do with the relative strength of the two armies or with any point admitting a doubt <\s>
<s> what need here of a court of judicature to settle who were the persons their names are subscribed by their own hands and to determine the quality of the thing <\s>
<s> actions and agents like these exhibited in this connection with each other must of necessity be condemned the moment they are known and to assert the contrary is to maintain that man is a being without understanding and that morality is an empty dream <\s>
<s> and if this condemnation must after this manner follow to utter it is less a duty than a further inevitable consequence from the constitution of human nature <\s>
<s> they who hold that the formal sanction of a court of judicature is in this case required before a people has a right to pass sentence know not to what degree they are enemies to that people and to mankind to what degree selfishness whether arising from their peculiar situation or from other causes has in them prevailed over those faculties which are our common inheritance and cut them off from fellowship with the species <\s>
<s> most deplorable would be the result if it were possible that the injunctions of these men could be obeyed or their remonstrances acknowledged to be just <\s>
<s> for not to mention that if it were not for such prompt decisions of the public voice misdemeanours of men high in office would rarely be accounted for at all we must bear in mind at this crisis that the adversary of all good is hourly and daily extending his ravages and according to such notions of fitness our indignation our sorrow our shame our sense of right and wrong and all those moral affections and powers of the understanding by which alone he can be effectually opposed are to enter upon a long vacation their motion is to be suspended a thing impossible if it could it would be destroyed <\s>
<s> let us now see what language the portugueze speak upon that part of the treaty which has incited me to give vent to these feelings and to assert these truths <\s>
<s> i protest says general friere against article xvii one of the two now under examination because it attempts to tie down the government of this kingdom not to bring to justice and condign punishment those persons who have been notoriously and scandalously disloyal to their prince and the country by joining and serving the french party and even if the english army should be allowed to screen them from the punishment they have deserved still it should not prevent their expulsion whereby this country would no longer have to fear being again betrayed by the same men <\s>
<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>
<s> couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange <\s>
<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>
<s> which amounts to this <\s>
<s> the french are called upon formally to relinquish in favour of the portugueze that to which they never had any right to abandon false claims which they either had a power to enforce or they had not if they departed immediately and had not power the article was nugatory if they remained a day longer and had power there was no security that they would abide by it <\s>
<s> accordingly loud complaints were made that after the date of the convention all kinds of ravages were committed by the french upon lisbon and its neighbourhood and what did it matter whether these were upon the plea of old debts and requisitions or new debts were created more greedily than ever from the consciousness that the time for collecting them was so short <\s>
<s> this article then the only one which is even in shew favourable to the portugueze is in substance nothing inasmuch as in what it is silent upon viz <\s>
<s> that the people of lisbon and its neighbourhood shall not be vexed and oppressed by the french during their stay with new claims and robberies it is grossly cruel or negligent and in that for which it actually stipulates wholly delusive <\s>

<s> yet from the place which this specious article occupies preceding immediately the 16th and 17th which we have been last considering it is clear that it must have been intended by the french general as honey smeared upon the edge of the cup to make the poison contained in those two more palateable <\s>

<s> let us now see what language the portugueze speak upon that part of the treaty which has incited me to give vent to these feelings and to assert these truths <\s>
<s> i protest says general friere against article xvii one of the two now under examination because it attempts to tie down the government of this kingdom not to bring to justice and condign punishment those persons who have been notoriously and scandalously disloyal to their prince and the country by joining and serving the french party and even if the english army should be allowed to screen them from the punishment they have deserved still it should not prevent their expulsion whereby this country would no longer have to fear being again betrayed by the same men <\s>
<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>
<s> couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange <\s>
<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>
<s> which amounts to this <\s>
<s> the french are called upon formally to relinquish in favour of the portugueze that to which they never had any right to abandon false claims which they either had a power to enforce or they had not if they departed immediately and had not power the article was nugatory if they remained a day longer and had power there was no security that they would abide by it <\s>
<s> accordingly loud complaints were made that after the date of the convention all kinds of ravages were committed by the french upon lisbon and its neighbourhood and what did it matter whether these were upon the plea of old debts and requisitions or new debts were created more greedily than ever from the consciousness that the time for collecting them was so short <\s>
<s> this article then the only one which is even in shew favourable to the portugueze is in substance nothing inasmuch as in what it is silent upon viz <\s>
<s> that the people of lisbon and its neighbourhood shall not be vexed and oppressed by the french during their stay with new claims and robberies it is grossly cruel or negligent and in that for which it actually stipulates wholly delusive <\s>
<s> it is in fact insulting for the very admission of a formal renunciation of these claims does to a certain degree acknowledge their justice <\s>
<s> the only decent manner of introducing matter to this effect would have been by placing it as a bye clause of a provision that secured the portugueze from further molestations and merely alluding to it as a thing understood of course <\s>
<s> yet from the place which this specious article occupies preceding immediately the 16th and 17th which we have been last considering it is clear that it must have been intended by the french general as honey smeared upon the edge of the cup to make the poison contained in those two more palateable <\s>
<s> thus much for the portugueze and their particular interests <\s>
<s> in one instance a concern of the spanish nation comes directly under notice and that nation also is treated without delicacy or feeling <\s>
<s> for by the 18th article it is agreed that the spaniards 4000 in number who had been disarmed and were confined on ship board in the port of lisbon by the french should be liberated <\s>
<s> and upon what consideration <\s>
<s> not upon their right to be free as having been treacherously and cruelly dealt with by men who were part of a power that was labouring to subjugate their country and in this attempt had committed inhuman crimes against it not even exchanged as soldiers against soldiers but the condition of their emancipation is that the british general engages to obtain of the spaniards to restore such french subjects either military or civil as have been detained in spain without having been taken in battle or in consequence of military operations but on account of the occurrences of the 29th of last may and the days immediately following <\s>
<s> i know not what are exactly the features of the face for which this word serves as a veil i have no register at hand to inform me what these events precisely were but there can be no doubt that it was a time of triumph for liberty and humanity and that the persons for whom these noble minded spaniards were to be exchanged were no other than a horde from among the most abject of the french nation probably those wretches who having never faced either the dangers or the fatigues of war had been most busy in secret preparations or were most conspicuous in open acts of massacre when the streets of madrid a few weeks before had been drenched with the blood of two thousand of her bravest citizens <\s>
<s> yet the liberation of these spaniards upon these terms is recorded in the report of the court of enquiry as one of the advantages which in the contemplation of the generals would result from the convention <\s>
<s> finally if there shall be any doubt article xiv as to the meaning of any article it shall be explained favourably to the french army and hostages article xx of the rank of field officers on the part of the british army and navy shall be furnished for the guarantee of the present convention <\s>
<s> i have now gone through the painful task of examining the most material conditions of the convention of cintra the whole number of the articles is twenty two with three additional ones a long ladder into a deep abyss of infamy need it be said that neglects injuries and insults like these which we have been contemplating come from what quarter they may let them be exhibited towards whom they will must produce not merely mistrust and jealousy but alienation and hatred <\s>
<s> the passions and feelings may be quieted or diverted for a short time but though out of sight or seemingly asleep they must exist and the life which they have received cannot but by a long course of justice and kindness be overcome and destroyed <\s>
<s> but why talk of a long course of justice and kindness when the immediate result must have been so deplorable <\s>
<s> relying upon our humanity our fellow feeling and our justice upon these instant and urgent claims sanctioned by the more mild one of ancient alliance the portugueze people by voices from every part of their land entreated our succour the arrival of a british army upon their coasts was joyfully hailed and the people of the country zealously assisted in landing the troops without which help as a british general has informed us that landing could not have been effected <\s>
<s> and it is in this manner that they are repaid <\s>
<s> to some port between rochefort and l'orient and be at liberty to serve i come to that memorable condition article v that the french army shall carry with it all its equipments that is to say its military chests and carriages attached to the field commissariat and field hospitals or shall be allowed to dispose of such part as the commander in chief may judge it unnecessary to embark <\s>
<s> in like manner all individuals of the army shall be at liberty to dispose of their private property of every description with full security hereafter for the purchasers <\s>
<s> this is expressed still more pointedly in the armistice though the meaning implied in the two articles is precisely the same <\s>
<s> for in the fifth article of the armistice it is agreed provisionally that all those of whom the french army consists shall be conveyed to france with arms and baggage and all their private property of every description no part of which shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> in the convention it is only expressed that they shall be at liberty to depart article ii with arms and baggage and article v to dispose of their private property of every description <\s>
<s> but if they had a right to dispose of it this would include a right to carry it away which was undoubtedly understood by the french general <\s>
<s> and in the armistice it is expressly said that their private property of every description shall be conveyed to france along with their persons <\s>
<s> what then are we to understand by the words their private property of every description <\s>
<s> equipments of the army in general and baggage of individuals had been stipulated for before now we all know that the lawful professional gains and earnings of a soldier must be small that he is not in the habit of carrying about him during actual warfare any accumulation of these or other property and that the ordinary private property which he can be supposed to have a just title to is included under the name of his baggage therefore this was something more and what it was is apparent <\s>
<s> no part of their property says the armistice shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> who does not see in these words the consciousness of guilt an indirect self betraying admission that they had in their hands treasures which might be lawfully taken from them and an anxiety to prevent that act of justice by a positive stipulation <\s>
<s> who does not see on what sort of property the frenchman had his eye that it was not property by right but their possessions their plunder every thing by what means soever acquired that the french army or any individual in it was possessed of <\s>
<s> but it has been urged that the monstrousness of such a supposition precludes this interpretation renders it impossible that it could either be intended by the one party or so understood by the other <\s>
<s> what right they who signed and he who ratified this convention have to shelter themselves under this plea will appear from the 16th and 17th articles <\s>
<s> in these it is stipulated that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or accidentally in the country shall have their property of every kind moveable and immoveable guaranteed to them with liberty of retaining or disposing of it and passing the produce into france the same is stipulated article xvii for such natives of portugal as have sided with the french or occupied situations under the french government <\s>
<s> here then is a direct avowal still more monstrous that every frenchman or native of a country in alliance with france however obnoxious his crimes may have made him and every traitorous portugueze shall have his property guaranteed to him both previously to and after the reinstatement of the portugueze government by the british army <\s>
<s> now let us ask what sense the word property must have had fastened to it in these cases <\s>
<s> must it not necessarily have included all the rewards which the frenchman had received for his iniquity and the traitorous portugueze for his treason <\s>
<s> for no man would bear a part in such oppressions or would be a traitor for nothing and moreover all the rewards which the french could bestow must have been taken from the portugueze extorted from the honest and loyal to be given to the wicked and disloyal these rewards of iniquity must necessarily have been included for on our side no attempt is made at a distinction and on the side of the french the word immoveable is manifestly intended to preclude such a distinction where alone it could have been effectual <\s>
<s> property then here means possessions thus infamously acquired and in the instance of the portugueze the fundamental notion of the word is subverted for a traitor can have no property till the government of his own country has remitted the punishment due to his crimes <\s>
<s> and these wages of guilt which the master by such exactions was enabled to pay and which the servant thus earned are to be guaranteed to him by a british army <\s>
<s> where does there exist a power on earth that could confer this right <\s>
<s> if the portugueze government itself had acted in this manner it would have been guilty of wilful suicide and the nation if it had acted so of high treason against itself <\s>
<s> let it not then be said that the monstrousness of covenanting to convey along with the persons of the french their plunder secures the article from the interpretation which the people of great britain gave and which i have now proved they were bound to give to it but conceding for a moment that it was not intended that the words should bear this sense and that neither in a fair grammatical construction nor as illustrated by other passages or by the general tenour of the document they actually did bear it had not unquestionable voices proclaimed the cruelty and rapacity the acts of sacrilege assassination and robbery by which these treasures had been amassed <\s>
<s> was not the perfidy of the french army and its contempt of moral obligation both as a body and as to the individuals which composed it infamous through europe therefore the concession would signify nothing for our generals by allowing an army of this character to depart with its equipments waggons military chest and baggage had provided abundant means to enable it to carry off whatsoever it desired and thus to elude and frustrate any stipulations which might have been made for compelling it to restore that which had been so iniquitously seized <\s>
<s> and here are we brought back to the fountain head of all this baseness to that apathy and deadness to the principle of justice through the influence of which this army outlawed by its crimes was suffered to depart from the land over which it had so long tyrannized other than as a band of disarmed prisoners i maintain therefore that permission to carry off the booty was distinctly expressed and if it had not been so that the principle of justice could not here be preserved as a violation of it must necessarily have followed from other conditions of the treaty <\s>
<s> sir hew dalrymple himself before the court of inquiry has told us in two letters to generals beresford and friere that such part of the plunder as was in money it would be difficult if not impossible to identify and consequently the french could not be prevented from carrying it away with them <\s>
<s> from the same letters we learn that the french were intending to carry off a considerable part of their plunder by calling it public money and saying that it belonged to the military chest and that their evasions of the article were most shameful and evinced a want of probity and honour which was most disgraceful to them <\s>
<s> if the french had given no other proofs of their want of such virtues than those furnished by this occasion neither the portugueze nor spanish nor british nations would condemn them nor hate them as they now do; nor would this article of the convention have excited such indignation <\s>
<s> for the french by so acting could not deem themselves breaking an engagement no doubt they looked upon themselves as injured that the failure in good faith was on the part of the british and that it was in the lawlessness of power and by a mere quibble that this construction was afterwards put upon the article in question <\s>

<s> was not the perfidy of the french army and its contempt of moral obligation both as a body and as to the individuals which composed it infamous through europe therefore the concession would signify nothing for our generals by allowing an army of this character to depart with its equipments waggons military chest and baggage had provided abundant means to enable it to carry off whatsoever it desired and thus to elude and frustrate any stipulations which might have been made for compelling it to restore that which had been so iniquitously seized <\s>
<s> and here are we brought back to the fountain head of all this baseness to that apathy and deadness to the principle of justice through the influence of which this army outlawed by its crimes was suffered to depart from the land over which it had so long tyrannized other than as a band of disarmed prisoners i maintain therefore that permission to carry off the booty was distinctly expressed and if it had not been so that the principle of justice could not here be preserved as a violation of it must necessarily have followed from other conditions of the treaty <\s>
<s> sir hew dalrymple himself before the court of inquiry has told us in two letters to generals beresford and friere that such part of the plunder as was in money it would be difficult if not impossible to identify and consequently the french could not be prevented from carrying it away with them <\s>
<s> from the same letters we learn that the french were intending to carry off a considerable part of their plunder by calling it public money and saying that it belonged to the military chest and that their evasions of the article were most shameful and evinced a want of probity and honour which was most disgraceful to them <\s>
<s> if the french had given no other proofs of their want of such virtues than those furnished by this occasion neither the portugueze nor spanish nor british nations would condemn them nor hate them as they now do; nor would this article of the convention have excited such indignation <\s>
<s> for the french by so acting could not deem themselves breaking an engagement no doubt they looked upon themselves as injured that the failure in good faith was on the part of the british and that it was in the lawlessness of power and by a mere quibble that this construction was afterwards put upon the article in question <\s>
<s> widely different from the conduct of the british was that of the spaniards in a like case with high feeling did they abating not a jot or a tittle enforce the principle of justice <\s>
<s> how says the governor of cadiz to general dupont in the same noble letter before alluded to how says he after enumerating the afflictions which his army and the tyrant who had sent it had unjustly brought upon the spanish nation for of these in their dealings with the french they never for a moment lost sight how asks he could you expect that your army should carry off from spain the fruit of its rapacity cruelty and impiety <\s>
<s> how could you conceive this possible or that we should be so stupid or senseless <\s>
<s> and this conduct is as wise in reason as it is true to nature <\s>
<s> the spanish people could have had no confidence in their government if it had not acted thus <\s>
<s> these are the sympathies which prove that a government is paternal that it makes one family with the people besides it is only by such adherence to justice that in times of like commotion popular excesses can either be mitigated or prevented <\s>
<s> if we would be efficient allies of spain nay if we would not run the risk of doing infinite harm these sentiments must not only be ours as a nation but they must pervade the hearts of our ministers and our generals our agents and our ambassadors <\s>
<s> if it be not so they who are sent abroad must either be conscious how unworthy they are and with what unworthy commissions they appear or not if they do feel this then they must hang their heads and blush for their country and themselves if they do not the spaniards must blush for them and revolt from them or what would be ten thousand times more deplorable they must purchase a reconcilement and a communion by a sacrifice of all that is excellent in themselves <\s>
<s> spain must either break down her lofty spirit her animation and fiery courage to run side by side in the same trammels with great britain or she must start off from her intended yoke fellow with contempt and aversion <\s>
<s> this is the alternative and there is no avoiding it <\s>
<s> i have yet to speak of the influence of such concessions upon the french ruler and his army <\s>
<s> with what satanic pride must he have contemplated the devotion of his servants and adherents to their law the steadiness and zeal of their perverse loyalty and the faithfulness with which they stand by him and each other <\s>
<s> how must his heart have distended with false glory while he contrasted these qualities of his subjects with the insensibility and slackness of his british enemies <\s>
<s> this notice has however no especial propriety in this place for as far as concerns bonaparte his pride and depraved confidence may be equally fed by almost all the conditions of this instrument <\s>
<s> but as to his army it is plain that the permission whether it be considered as by an express article formally granted or only involved in the general conditions of the treaty to bear away in triumph the harvest of its crimes must not only have emboldened and exalted it with arrogance and whetted its rapacity but that hereby every soldier of which this army was composed must upon his arrival in his own country have been a seed which would give back plenteously in its kind <\s>
<s> the french are at present a needy people without commerce or manufactures unsettled in their minds and debased in their morals by revolutionary practices and habits of warfare and the youth of the country are rendered desperate by oppression which leaving no choice in their occupation discharges them from all responsibility to their own consciences <\s>
<s> how powerful then must have been the action of such incitements upon a people so circumstanced <\s>
<s> the actual sight and far more the imaginary sight and handling of these treasures magnified by the romantic tales which must have been spread about them would carry into every town and village an antidote for the terrors of conscription and would rouze men like the dreams imported from the new world when the first discoverers and adventurers returned with their ingots and their gold dust their stories and their promises to inflame and madden the avarice of the old <\s>
<s> what an effect says the governor of cadiz must it have upon the people he means the spanish people to know that a single soldier was carrying away 2580 livres tournois <\s>
<s> what an effect he might have said also must it have upon the french i direct the reader's attention to this because it seems to have been overlooked and because some of the public journals speaking of the convention and no doubt uttering the sentiments of several of their readers say that they are disgusted with the transaction not because the french have been permitted to carry off a few diamonds or some ingots of silver but because we confessed by consenting to the treaty that an army of 35,000 british troops aided by the portugueze nation was not able to compel 20,000 french to surrender at discretion <\s>
<s> this is indeed the root of the evil as hath been shewn and it is the curse of this treaty that the several parts of it are of such enormity as singly to occupy the attention and to destroy comparison and coexistence <\s>
<s> but the people of great britain are disgusted both with the one and the other <\s>
<s> they bewail the violation of the principle if the value of the things carried off had been in itself trifling their grief and their indignation would have been scarcely less <\s>
<s> but it is manifest from what has been said that it was not trifling and that therefore upon that account as well as upon others this permission was no less impolitic than it was unjust and dishonourable <\s>
<s> in illustrating these articles of the armistice and convention by which the french were both expressly permitted and indirectly enabled to carry off their booty we have already seen that a concession was made which is still more enormous viz <\s>
<s> that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or resident there and all natives of portugal who have accepted situations under the french government c shall have their property of every kind guaranteed to them by the british army <\s>
<s> by articles 16th and 17th their persons are placed under the like protection <\s>
<s> the french article xvi shall be at liberty either to accompany the french army or to remain in portugal and the portugueze article xvii shall not be rendered accountable for their political conduct during the period of the occupation of the country by the french army they all are placed under the protection of the british commanders and shall sustain no injury in their property or persons <\s>
<s> i have animadverted heretofore upon the unprofessional eagerness of our generals to appear in the character of negotiators when the sword would have done them more service than the pen <\s>
<s> but if they had confined themselves to mere military regulations they might indeed with justice have been grievously censured as injudicious commanders whose notion of the honour of armies was of a low pitch and who had no conception of the peculiar nature of the service in which they were engaged but the censure must have stopped here <\s>
<s> whereas by these provisions they have shewn that they have never reflected upon the nature of military authority as contra distinguished from civil <\s>
<s> french example had so far dazzled and blinded them that the french army is suffered to denominate itself the french government and from the whole tenour of these instruments from the preamble and these articles especially it should seem that our generals fancied themselves and their army to be the british government <\s>
<s> for these regulations emanating from a mere military authority are purely civil but of such a kind that no power on earth could confer a right to establish them <\s>
<s> and this trampling upon the most sacred rights this sacrifice of the consciousness of a self preserving principle without which neither societies nor governments can exist is not made by our generals in relation to subjects of their own sovereign but to an independent nation our ally into whose territories we could not have entered but from its confidence in our friendship and good faith <\s>
<s> surely the persons who under the countenance of too high authority have talked so loudly of prejudging this question entirely overlooked or utterly forgot this part of it <\s>
<s> what have these monstrous provisions to do with the relative strength of the two armies or with any point admitting a doubt <\s>
<s> what need here of a court of judicature to settle who were the persons their names are subscribed by their own hands and to determine the quality of the thing <\s>
<s> actions and agents like these exhibited in this connection with each other must of necessity be condemned the moment they are known and to assert the contrary is to maintain that man is a being without understanding and that morality is an empty dream <\s>
<s> and if this condemnation must after this manner follow to utter it is less a duty than a further inevitable consequence from the constitution of human nature <\s>
<s> they who hold that the formal sanction of a court of judicature is in this case required before a people has a right to pass sentence know not to what degree they are enemies to that people and to mankind to what degree selfishness whether arising from their peculiar situation or from other causes has in them prevailed over those faculties which are our common inheritance and cut them off from fellowship with the species <\s>
<s> most deplorable would be the result if it were possible that the injunctions of these men could be obeyed or their remonstrances acknowledged to be just <\s>
<s> for not to mention that if it were not for such prompt decisions of the public voice misdemeanours of men high in office would rarely be accounted for at all we must bear in mind at this crisis that the adversary of all good is hourly and daily extending his ravages and according to such notions of fitness our indignation our sorrow our shame our sense of right and wrong and all those moral affections and powers of the understanding by which alone he can be effectually opposed are to enter upon a long vacation their motion is to be suspended a thing impossible if it could it would be destroyed <\s>
<s> let us now see what language the portugueze speak upon that part of the treaty which has incited me to give vent to these feelings and to assert these truths <\s>
<s> i protest says general friere against article xvii one of the two now under examination because it attempts to tie down the government of this kingdom not to bring to justice and condign punishment those persons who have been notoriously and scandalously disloyal to their prince and the country by joining and serving the french party and even if the english army should be allowed to screen them from the punishment they have deserved still it should not prevent their expulsion whereby this country would no longer have to fear being again betrayed by the same men <\s>
<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>
<s> couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange <\s>
<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>

<s> let us now see what language the portugueze speak upon that part of the treaty which has incited me to give vent to these feelings and to assert these truths <\s>
<s> i protest says general friere against article xvii one of the two now under examination because it attempts to tie down the government of this kingdom not to bring to justice and condign punishment those persons who have been notoriously and scandalously disloyal to their prince and the country by joining and serving the french party and even if the english army should be allowed to screen them from the punishment they have deserved still it should not prevent their expulsion whereby this country would no longer have to fear being again betrayed by the same men <\s>
<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>
<s> couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange <\s>
<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>
<s> which amounts to this <\s>
<s> the french are called upon formally to relinquish in favour of the portugueze that to which they never had any right to abandon false claims which they either had a power to enforce or they had not if they departed immediately and had not power the article was nugatory if they remained a day longer and had power there was no security that they would abide by it <\s>
<s> accordingly loud complaints were made that after the date of the convention all kinds of ravages were committed by the french upon lisbon and its neighbourhood and what did it matter whether these were upon the plea of old debts and requisitions or new debts were created more greedily than ever from the consciousness that the time for collecting them was so short <\s>
<s> this article then the only one which is even in shew favourable to the portugueze is in substance nothing inasmuch as in what it is silent upon viz <\s>
<s> that the people of lisbon and its neighbourhood shall not be vexed and oppressed by the french during their stay with new claims and robberies it is grossly cruel or negligent and in that for which it actually stipulates wholly delusive <\s>
<s> it is in fact insulting for the very admission of a formal renunciation of these claims does to a certain degree acknowledge their justice <\s>
<s> the only decent manner of introducing matter to this effect would have been by placing it as a bye clause of a provision that secured the portugueze from further molestations and merely alluding to it as a thing understood of course <\s>
<s> yet from the place which this specious article occupies preceding immediately the 16th and 17th which we have been last considering it is clear that it must have been intended by the french general as honey smeared upon the edge of the cup to make the poison contained in those two more palateable <\s>
<s> thus much for the portugueze and their particular interests <\s>
<s> in one instance a concern of the spanish nation comes directly under notice and that nation also is treated without delicacy or feeling <\s>
<s> for by the 18th article it is agreed that the spaniards 4000 in number who had been disarmed and were confined on ship board in the port of lisbon by the french should be liberated <\s>
<s> and upon what consideration <\s>
<s> not upon their right to be free as having been treacherously and cruelly dealt with by men who were part of a power that was labouring to subjugate their country and in this attempt had committed inhuman crimes against it not even exchanged as soldiers against soldiers but the condition of their emancipation is that the british general engages to obtain of the spaniards to restore such french subjects either military or civil as have been detained in spain without having been taken in battle or in consequence of military operations but on account of the occurrences of the 29th of last may and the days immediately following <\s>
<s> i know not what are exactly the features of the face for which this word serves as a veil i have no register at hand to inform me what these events precisely were but there can be no doubt that it was a time of triumph for liberty and humanity and that the persons for whom these noble minded spaniards were to be exchanged were no other than a horde from among the most abject of the french nation probably those wretches who having never faced either the dangers or the fatigues of war had been most busy in secret preparations or were most conspicuous in open acts of massacre when the streets of madrid a few weeks before had been drenched with the blood of two thousand of her bravest citizens <\s>
<s> yet the liberation of these spaniards upon these terms is recorded in the report of the court of enquiry as one of the advantages which in the contemplation of the generals would result from the convention <\s>
<s> finally if there shall be any doubt article xiv as to the meaning of any article it shall be explained favourably to the french army and hostages article xx of the rank of field officers on the part of the british army and navy shall be furnished for the guarantee of the present convention <\s>
<s> i have now gone through the painful task of examining the most material conditions of the convention of cintra the whole number of the articles is twenty two with three additional ones a long ladder into a deep abyss of infamy need it be said that neglects injuries and insults like these which we have been contemplating come from what quarter they may let them be exhibited towards whom they will must produce not merely mistrust and jealousy but alienation and hatred <\s>
<s> the passions and feelings may be quieted or diverted for a short time but though out of sight or seemingly asleep they must exist and the life which they have received cannot but by a long course of justice and kindness be overcome and destroyed <\s>
<s> but why talk of a long course of justice and kindness when the immediate result must have been so deplorable <\s>
<s> relying upon our humanity our fellow feeling and our justice upon these instant and urgent claims sanctioned by the more mild one of ancient alliance the portugueze people by voices from every part of their land entreated our succour the arrival of a british army upon their coasts was joyfully hailed and the people of the country zealously assisted in landing the troops without which help as a british general has informed us that landing could not have been effected <\s>
<s> and it is in this manner that they are repaid <\s>
<s> to some port between rochefort and l'orient and be at liberty to serve i come to that memorable condition article v that the french army shall carry with it all its equipments that is to say its military chests and carriages attached to the field commissariat and field hospitals or shall be allowed to dispose of such part as the commander in chief may judge it unnecessary to embark <\s>
<s> in like manner all individuals of the army shall be at liberty to dispose of their private property of every description with full security hereafter for the purchasers <\s>
<s> this is expressed still more pointedly in the armistice though the meaning implied in the two articles is precisely the same <\s>
<s> for in the fifth article of the armistice it is agreed provisionally that all those of whom the french army consists shall be conveyed to france with arms and baggage and all their private property of every description no part of which shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> in the convention it is only expressed that they shall be at liberty to depart article ii with arms and baggage and article v to dispose of their private property of every description <\s>
<s> but if they had a right to dispose of it this would include a right to carry it away which was undoubtedly understood by the french general <\s>
<s> and in the armistice it is expressly said that their private property of every description shall be conveyed to france along with their persons <\s>
<s> what then are we to understand by the words their private property of every description <\s>
<s> equipments of the army in general and baggage of individuals had been stipulated for before now we all know that the lawful professional gains and earnings of a soldier must be small that he is not in the habit of carrying about him during actual warfare any accumulation of these or other property and that the ordinary private property which he can be supposed to have a just title to is included under the name of his baggage therefore this was something more and what it was is apparent <\s>
<s> no part of their property says the armistice shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> who does not see in these words the consciousness of guilt an indirect self betraying admission that they had in their hands treasures which might be lawfully taken from them and an anxiety to prevent that act of justice by a positive stipulation <\s>
<s> who does not see on what sort of property the frenchman had his eye that it was not property by right but their possessions their plunder every thing by what means soever acquired that the french army or any individual in it was possessed of <\s>
<s> but it has been urged that the monstrousness of such a supposition precludes this interpretation renders it impossible that it could either be intended by the one party or so understood by the other <\s>
<s> what right they who signed and he who ratified this convention have to shelter themselves under this plea will appear from the 16th and 17th articles <\s>
<s> in these it is stipulated that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or accidentally in the country shall have their property of every kind moveable and immoveable guaranteed to them with liberty of retaining or disposing of it and passing the produce into france the same is stipulated article xvii for such natives of portugal as have sided with the french or occupied situations under the french government <\s>
<s> here then is a direct avowal still more monstrous that every frenchman or native of a country in alliance with france however obnoxious his crimes may have made him and every traitorous portugueze shall have his property guaranteed to him both previously to and after the reinstatement of the portugueze government by the british army <\s>
<s> now let us ask what sense the word property must have had fastened to it in these cases <\s>
<s> must it not necessarily have included all the rewards which the frenchman had received for his iniquity and the traitorous portugueze for his treason <\s>
<s> for no man would bear a part in such oppressions or would be a traitor for nothing and moreover all the rewards which the french could bestow must have been taken from the portugueze extorted from the honest and loyal to be given to the wicked and disloyal these rewards of iniquity must necessarily have been included for on our side no attempt is made at a distinction and on the side of the french the word immoveable is manifestly intended to preclude such a distinction where alone it could have been effectual <\s>
<s> property then here means possessions thus infamously acquired and in the instance of the portugueze the fundamental notion of the word is subverted for a traitor can have no property till the government of his own country has remitted the punishment due to his crimes <\s>
<s> and these wages of guilt which the master by such exactions was enabled to pay and which the servant thus earned are to be guaranteed to him by a british army <\s>
<s> where does there exist a power on earth that could confer this right <\s>
<s> if the portugueze government itself had acted in this manner it would have been guilty of wilful suicide and the nation if it had acted so of high treason against itself <\s>
<s> let it not then be said that the monstrousness of covenanting to convey along with the persons of the french their plunder secures the article from the interpretation which the people of great britain gave and which i have now proved they were bound to give to it but conceding for a moment that it was not intended that the words should bear this sense and that neither in a fair grammatical construction nor as illustrated by other passages or by the general tenour of the document they actually did bear it had not unquestionable voices proclaimed the cruelty and rapacity the acts of sacrilege assassination and robbery by which these treasures had been amassed <\s>
<s> was not the perfidy of the french army and its contempt of moral obligation both as a body and as to the individuals which composed it infamous through europe therefore the concession would signify nothing for our generals by allowing an army of this character to depart with its equipments waggons military chest and baggage had provided abundant means to enable it to carry off whatsoever it desired and thus to elude and frustrate any stipulations which might have been made for compelling it to restore that which had been so iniquitously seized <\s>

<s> what right they who signed and he who ratified this convention have to shelter themselves under this plea will appear from the 16th and 17th articles <\s>
<s> in these it is stipulated that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or accidentally in the country shall have their property of every kind moveable and immoveable guaranteed to them with liberty of retaining or disposing of it and passing the produce into france the same is stipulated article xvii for such natives of portugal as have sided with the french or occupied situations under the french government <\s>
<s> here then is a direct avowal still more monstrous that every frenchman or native of a country in alliance with france however obnoxious his crimes may have made him and every traitorous portugueze shall have his property guaranteed to him both previously to and after the reinstatement of the portugueze government by the british army <\s>
<s> now let us ask what sense the word property must have had fastened to it in these cases <\s>
<s> must it not necessarily have included all the rewards which the frenchman had received for his iniquity and the traitorous portugueze for his treason <\s>
<s> for no man would bear a part in such oppressions or would be a traitor for nothing and moreover all the rewards which the french could bestow must have been taken from the portugueze extorted from the honest and loyal to be given to the wicked and disloyal these rewards of iniquity must necessarily have been included for on our side no attempt is made at a distinction and on the side of the french the word immoveable is manifestly intended to preclude such a distinction where alone it could have been effectual <\s>
<s> property then here means possessions thus infamously acquired and in the instance of the portugueze the fundamental notion of the word is subverted for a traitor can have no property till the government of his own country has remitted the punishment due to his crimes <\s>
<s> and these wages of guilt which the master by such exactions was enabled to pay and which the servant thus earned are to be guaranteed to him by a british army <\s>
<s> where does there exist a power on earth that could confer this right <\s>
<s> if the portugueze government itself had acted in this manner it would have been guilty of wilful suicide and the nation if it had acted so of high treason against itself <\s>
<s> let it not then be said that the monstrousness of covenanting to convey along with the persons of the french their plunder secures the article from the interpretation which the people of great britain gave and which i have now proved they were bound to give to it but conceding for a moment that it was not intended that the words should bear this sense and that neither in a fair grammatical construction nor as illustrated by other passages or by the general tenour of the document they actually did bear it had not unquestionable voices proclaimed the cruelty and rapacity the acts of sacrilege assassination and robbery by which these treasures had been amassed <\s>
<s> was not the perfidy of the french army and its contempt of moral obligation both as a body and as to the individuals which composed it infamous through europe therefore the concession would signify nothing for our generals by allowing an army of this character to depart with its equipments waggons military chest and baggage had provided abundant means to enable it to carry off whatsoever it desired and thus to elude and frustrate any stipulations which might have been made for compelling it to restore that which had been so iniquitously seized <\s>
<s> and here are we brought back to the fountain head of all this baseness to that apathy and deadness to the principle of justice through the influence of which this army outlawed by its crimes was suffered to depart from the land over which it had so long tyrannized other than as a band of disarmed prisoners i maintain therefore that permission to carry off the booty was distinctly expressed and if it had not been so that the principle of justice could not here be preserved as a violation of it must necessarily have followed from other conditions of the treaty <\s>
<s> sir hew dalrymple himself before the court of inquiry has told us in two letters to generals beresford and friere that such part of the plunder as was in money it would be difficult if not impossible to identify and consequently the french could not be prevented from carrying it away with them <\s>
<s> from the same letters we learn that the french were intending to carry off a considerable part of their plunder by calling it public money and saying that it belonged to the military chest and that their evasions of the article were most shameful and evinced a want of probity and honour which was most disgraceful to them <\s>
<s> if the french had given no other proofs of their want of such virtues than those furnished by this occasion neither the portugueze nor spanish nor british nations would condemn them nor hate them as they now do; nor would this article of the convention have excited such indignation <\s>
<s> for the french by so acting could not deem themselves breaking an engagement no doubt they looked upon themselves as injured that the failure in good faith was on the part of the british and that it was in the lawlessness of power and by a mere quibble that this construction was afterwards put upon the article in question <\s>
<s> widely different from the conduct of the british was that of the spaniards in a like case with high feeling did they abating not a jot or a tittle enforce the principle of justice <\s>
<s> how says the governor of cadiz to general dupont in the same noble letter before alluded to how says he after enumerating the afflictions which his army and the tyrant who had sent it had unjustly brought upon the spanish nation for of these in their dealings with the french they never for a moment lost sight how asks he could you expect that your army should carry off from spain the fruit of its rapacity cruelty and impiety <\s>
<s> how could you conceive this possible or that we should be so stupid or senseless <\s>
<s> and this conduct is as wise in reason as it is true to nature <\s>
<s> the spanish people could have had no confidence in their government if it had not acted thus <\s>
<s> these are the sympathies which prove that a government is paternal that it makes one family with the people besides it is only by such adherence to justice that in times of like commotion popular excesses can either be mitigated or prevented <\s>
<s> if we would be efficient allies of spain nay if we would not run the risk of doing infinite harm these sentiments must not only be ours as a nation but they must pervade the hearts of our ministers and our generals our agents and our ambassadors <\s>
<s> if it be not so they who are sent abroad must either be conscious how unworthy they are and with what unworthy commissions they appear or not if they do feel this then they must hang their heads and blush for their country and themselves if they do not the spaniards must blush for them and revolt from them or what would be ten thousand times more deplorable they must purchase a reconcilement and a communion by a sacrifice of all that is excellent in themselves <\s>
<s> spain must either break down her lofty spirit her animation and fiery courage to run side by side in the same trammels with great britain or she must start off from her intended yoke fellow with contempt and aversion <\s>
<s> this is the alternative and there is no avoiding it <\s>
<s> i have yet to speak of the influence of such concessions upon the french ruler and his army <\s>
<s> with what satanic pride must he have contemplated the devotion of his servants and adherents to their law the steadiness and zeal of their perverse loyalty and the faithfulness with which they stand by him and each other <\s>
<s> how must his heart have distended with false glory while he contrasted these qualities of his subjects with the insensibility and slackness of his british enemies <\s>
<s> this notice has however no especial propriety in this place for as far as concerns bonaparte his pride and depraved confidence may be equally fed by almost all the conditions of this instrument <\s>
<s> but as to his army it is plain that the permission whether it be considered as by an express article formally granted or only involved in the general conditions of the treaty to bear away in triumph the harvest of its crimes must not only have emboldened and exalted it with arrogance and whetted its rapacity but that hereby every soldier of which this army was composed must upon his arrival in his own country have been a seed which would give back plenteously in its kind <\s>
<s> the french are at present a needy people without commerce or manufactures unsettled in their minds and debased in their morals by revolutionary practices and habits of warfare and the youth of the country are rendered desperate by oppression which leaving no choice in their occupation discharges them from all responsibility to their own consciences <\s>
<s> how powerful then must have been the action of such incitements upon a people so circumstanced <\s>
<s> the actual sight and far more the imaginary sight and handling of these treasures magnified by the romantic tales which must have been spread about them would carry into every town and village an antidote for the terrors of conscription and would rouze men like the dreams imported from the new world when the first discoverers and adventurers returned with their ingots and their gold dust their stories and their promises to inflame and madden the avarice of the old <\s>
<s> what an effect says the governor of cadiz must it have upon the people he means the spanish people to know that a single soldier was carrying away 2580 livres tournois <\s>
<s> what an effect he might have said also must it have upon the french i direct the reader's attention to this because it seems to have been overlooked and because some of the public journals speaking of the convention and no doubt uttering the sentiments of several of their readers say that they are disgusted with the transaction not because the french have been permitted to carry off a few diamonds or some ingots of silver but because we confessed by consenting to the treaty that an army of 35,000 british troops aided by the portugueze nation was not able to compel 20,000 french to surrender at discretion <\s>
<s> this is indeed the root of the evil as hath been shewn and it is the curse of this treaty that the several parts of it are of such enormity as singly to occupy the attention and to destroy comparison and coexistence <\s>
<s> but the people of great britain are disgusted both with the one and the other <\s>
<s> they bewail the violation of the principle if the value of the things carried off had been in itself trifling their grief and their indignation would have been scarcely less <\s>
<s> but it is manifest from what has been said that it was not trifling and that therefore upon that account as well as upon others this permission was no less impolitic than it was unjust and dishonourable <\s>
<s> in illustrating these articles of the armistice and convention by which the french were both expressly permitted and indirectly enabled to carry off their booty we have already seen that a concession was made which is still more enormous viz <\s>
<s> that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or resident there and all natives of portugal who have accepted situations under the french government c shall have their property of every kind guaranteed to them by the british army <\s>
<s> by articles 16th and 17th their persons are placed under the like protection <\s>
<s> the french article xvi shall be at liberty either to accompany the french army or to remain in portugal and the portugueze article xvii shall not be rendered accountable for their political conduct during the period of the occupation of the country by the french army they all are placed under the protection of the british commanders and shall sustain no injury in their property or persons <\s>
<s> i have animadverted heretofore upon the unprofessional eagerness of our generals to appear in the character of negotiators when the sword would have done them more service than the pen <\s>
<s> but if they had confined themselves to mere military regulations they might indeed with justice have been grievously censured as injudicious commanders whose notion of the honour of armies was of a low pitch and who had no conception of the peculiar nature of the service in which they were engaged but the censure must have stopped here <\s>
<s> whereas by these provisions they have shewn that they have never reflected upon the nature of military authority as contra distinguished from civil <\s>
<s> french example had so far dazzled and blinded them that the french army is suffered to denominate itself the french government and from the whole tenour of these instruments from the preamble and these articles especially it should seem that our generals fancied themselves and their army to be the british government <\s>
<s> for these regulations emanating from a mere military authority are purely civil but of such a kind that no power on earth could confer a right to establish them <\s>
<s> and this trampling upon the most sacred rights this sacrifice of the consciousness of a self preserving principle without which neither societies nor governments can exist is not made by our generals in relation to subjects of their own sovereign but to an independent nation our ally into whose territories we could not have entered but from its confidence in our friendship and good faith <\s>
<s> surely the persons who under the countenance of too high authority have talked so loudly of prejudging this question entirely overlooked or utterly forgot this part of it <\s>
<s> what have these monstrous provisions to do with the relative strength of the two armies or with any point admitting a doubt <\s>
<s> what need here of a court of judicature to settle who were the persons their names are subscribed by their own hands and to determine the quality of the thing <\s>
<s> actions and agents like these exhibited in this connection with each other must of necessity be condemned the moment they are known and to assert the contrary is to maintain that man is a being without understanding and that morality is an empty dream <\s>
<s> and if this condemnation must after this manner follow to utter it is less a duty than a further inevitable consequence from the constitution of human nature <\s>
<s> they who hold that the formal sanction of a court of judicature is in this case required before a people has a right to pass sentence know not to what degree they are enemies to that people and to mankind to what degree selfishness whether arising from their peculiar situation or from other causes has in them prevailed over those faculties which are our common inheritance and cut them off from fellowship with the species <\s>
<s> most deplorable would be the result if it were possible that the injunctions of these men could be obeyed or their remonstrances acknowledged to be just <\s>
<s> for not to mention that if it were not for such prompt decisions of the public voice misdemeanours of men high in office would rarely be accounted for at all we must bear in mind at this crisis that the adversary of all good is hourly and daily extending his ravages and according to such notions of fitness our indignation our sorrow our shame our sense of right and wrong and all those moral affections and powers of the understanding by which alone he can be effectually opposed are to enter upon a long vacation their motion is to be suspended a thing impossible if it could it would be destroyed <\s>

<s> and if this condemnation must after this manner follow to utter it is less a duty than a further inevitable consequence from the constitution of human nature <\s>
<s> they who hold that the formal sanction of a court of judicature is in this case required before a people has a right to pass sentence know not to what degree they are enemies to that people and to mankind to what degree selfishness whether arising from their peculiar situation or from other causes has in them prevailed over those faculties which are our common inheritance and cut them off from fellowship with the species <\s>
<s> most deplorable would be the result if it were possible that the injunctions of these men could be obeyed or their remonstrances acknowledged to be just <\s>
<s> for not to mention that if it were not for such prompt decisions of the public voice misdemeanours of men high in office would rarely be accounted for at all we must bear in mind at this crisis that the adversary of all good is hourly and daily extending his ravages and according to such notions of fitness our indignation our sorrow our shame our sense of right and wrong and all those moral affections and powers of the understanding by which alone he can be effectually opposed are to enter upon a long vacation their motion is to be suspended a thing impossible if it could it would be destroyed <\s>
<s> let us now see what language the portugueze speak upon that part of the treaty which has incited me to give vent to these feelings and to assert these truths <\s>
<s> i protest says general friere against article xvii one of the two now under examination because it attempts to tie down the government of this kingdom not to bring to justice and condign punishment those persons who have been notoriously and scandalously disloyal to their prince and the country by joining and serving the french party and even if the english army should be allowed to screen them from the punishment they have deserved still it should not prevent their expulsion whereby this country would no longer have to fear being again betrayed by the same men <\s>
<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>
<s> couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange <\s>
<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>
<s> which amounts to this <\s>
<s> the french are called upon formally to relinquish in favour of the portugueze that to which they never had any right to abandon false claims which they either had a power to enforce or they had not if they departed immediately and had not power the article was nugatory if they remained a day longer and had power there was no security that they would abide by it <\s>
<s> accordingly loud complaints were made that after the date of the convention all kinds of ravages were committed by the french upon lisbon and its neighbourhood and what did it matter whether these were upon the plea of old debts and requisitions or new debts were created more greedily than ever from the consciousness that the time for collecting them was so short <\s>
<s> this article then the only one which is even in shew favourable to the portugueze is in substance nothing inasmuch as in what it is silent upon viz <\s>
<s> that the people of lisbon and its neighbourhood shall not be vexed and oppressed by the french during their stay with new claims and robberies it is grossly cruel or negligent and in that for which it actually stipulates wholly delusive <\s>
<s> it is in fact insulting for the very admission of a formal renunciation of these claims does to a certain degree acknowledge their justice <\s>
<s> the only decent manner of introducing matter to this effect would have been by placing it as a bye clause of a provision that secured the portugueze from further molestations and merely alluding to it as a thing understood of course <\s>
<s> yet from the place which this specious article occupies preceding immediately the 16th and 17th which we have been last considering it is clear that it must have been intended by the french general as honey smeared upon the edge of the cup to make the poison contained in those two more palateable <\s>
<s> thus much for the portugueze and their particular interests <\s>
<s> in one instance a concern of the spanish nation comes directly under notice and that nation also is treated without delicacy or feeling <\s>
<s> for by the 18th article it is agreed that the spaniards 4000 in number who had been disarmed and were confined on ship board in the port of lisbon by the french should be liberated <\s>
<s> and upon what consideration <\s>
<s> not upon their right to be free as having been treacherously and cruelly dealt with by men who were part of a power that was labouring to subjugate their country and in this attempt had committed inhuman crimes against it not even exchanged as soldiers against soldiers but the condition of their emancipation is that the british general engages to obtain of the spaniards to restore such french subjects either military or civil as have been detained in spain without having been taken in battle or in consequence of military operations but on account of the occurrences of the 29th of last may and the days immediately following <\s>
<s> i know not what are exactly the features of the face for which this word serves as a veil i have no register at hand to inform me what these events precisely were but there can be no doubt that it was a time of triumph for liberty and humanity and that the persons for whom these noble minded spaniards were to be exchanged were no other than a horde from among the most abject of the french nation probably those wretches who having never faced either the dangers or the fatigues of war had been most busy in secret preparations or were most conspicuous in open acts of massacre when the streets of madrid a few weeks before had been drenched with the blood of two thousand of her bravest citizens <\s>
<s> yet the liberation of these spaniards upon these terms is recorded in the report of the court of enquiry as one of the advantages which in the contemplation of the generals would result from the convention <\s>
<s> finally if there shall be any doubt article xiv as to the meaning of any article it shall be explained favourably to the french army and hostages article xx of the rank of field officers on the part of the british army and navy shall be furnished for the guarantee of the present convention <\s>
<s> i have now gone through the painful task of examining the most material conditions of the convention of cintra the whole number of the articles is twenty two with three additional ones a long ladder into a deep abyss of infamy need it be said that neglects injuries and insults like these which we have been contemplating come from what quarter they may let them be exhibited towards whom they will must produce not merely mistrust and jealousy but alienation and hatred <\s>
<s> the passions and feelings may be quieted or diverted for a short time but though out of sight or seemingly asleep they must exist and the life which they have received cannot but by a long course of justice and kindness be overcome and destroyed <\s>
<s> but why talk of a long course of justice and kindness when the immediate result must have been so deplorable <\s>
<s> relying upon our humanity our fellow feeling and our justice upon these instant and urgent claims sanctioned by the more mild one of ancient alliance the portugueze people by voices from every part of their land entreated our succour the arrival of a british army upon their coasts was joyfully hailed and the people of the country zealously assisted in landing the troops without which help as a british general has informed us that landing could not have been effected <\s>
<s> and it is in this manner that they are repaid <\s>
<s> to some port between rochefort and l'orient and be at liberty to serve i come to that memorable condition article v that the french army shall carry with it all its equipments that is to say its military chests and carriages attached to the field commissariat and field hospitals or shall be allowed to dispose of such part as the commander in chief may judge it unnecessary to embark <\s>
<s> in like manner all individuals of the army shall be at liberty to dispose of their private property of every description with full security hereafter for the purchasers <\s>
<s> this is expressed still more pointedly in the armistice though the meaning implied in the two articles is precisely the same <\s>
<s> for in the fifth article of the armistice it is agreed provisionally that all those of whom the french army consists shall be conveyed to france with arms and baggage and all their private property of every description no part of which shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> in the convention it is only expressed that they shall be at liberty to depart article ii with arms and baggage and article v to dispose of their private property of every description <\s>
<s> but if they had a right to dispose of it this would include a right to carry it away which was undoubtedly understood by the french general <\s>
<s> and in the armistice it is expressly said that their private property of every description shall be conveyed to france along with their persons <\s>
<s> what then are we to understand by the words their private property of every description <\s>
<s> equipments of the army in general and baggage of individuals had been stipulated for before now we all know that the lawful professional gains and earnings of a soldier must be small that he is not in the habit of carrying about him during actual warfare any accumulation of these or other property and that the ordinary private property which he can be supposed to have a just title to is included under the name of his baggage therefore this was something more and what it was is apparent <\s>
<s> no part of their property says the armistice shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> who does not see in these words the consciousness of guilt an indirect self betraying admission that they had in their hands treasures which might be lawfully taken from them and an anxiety to prevent that act of justice by a positive stipulation <\s>
<s> who does not see on what sort of property the frenchman had his eye that it was not property by right but their possessions their plunder every thing by what means soever acquired that the french army or any individual in it was possessed of <\s>
<s> but it has been urged that the monstrousness of such a supposition precludes this interpretation renders it impossible that it could either be intended by the one party or so understood by the other <\s>
<s> what right they who signed and he who ratified this convention have to shelter themselves under this plea will appear from the 16th and 17th articles <\s>
<s> in these it is stipulated that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or accidentally in the country shall have their property of every kind moveable and immoveable guaranteed to them with liberty of retaining or disposing of it and passing the produce into france the same is stipulated article xvii for such natives of portugal as have sided with the french or occupied situations under the french government <\s>
<s> here then is a direct avowal still more monstrous that every frenchman or native of a country in alliance with france however obnoxious his crimes may have made him and every traitorous portugueze shall have his property guaranteed to him both previously to and after the reinstatement of the portugueze government by the british army <\s>
<s> now let us ask what sense the word property must have had fastened to it in these cases <\s>
<s> must it not necessarily have included all the rewards which the frenchman had received for his iniquity and the traitorous portugueze for his treason <\s>
<s> for no man would bear a part in such oppressions or would be a traitor for nothing and moreover all the rewards which the french could bestow must have been taken from the portugueze extorted from the honest and loyal to be given to the wicked and disloyal these rewards of iniquity must necessarily have been included for on our side no attempt is made at a distinction and on the side of the french the word immoveable is manifestly intended to preclude such a distinction where alone it could have been effectual <\s>
<s> property then here means possessions thus infamously acquired and in the instance of the portugueze the fundamental notion of the word is subverted for a traitor can have no property till the government of his own country has remitted the punishment due to his crimes <\s>
<s> and these wages of guilt which the master by such exactions was enabled to pay and which the servant thus earned are to be guaranteed to him by a british army <\s>
<s> where does there exist a power on earth that could confer this right <\s>
<s> if the portugueze government itself had acted in this manner it would have been guilty of wilful suicide and the nation if it had acted so of high treason against itself <\s>
<s> let it not then be said that the monstrousness of covenanting to convey along with the persons of the french their plunder secures the article from the interpretation which the people of great britain gave and which i have now proved they were bound to give to it but conceding for a moment that it was not intended that the words should bear this sense and that neither in a fair grammatical construction nor as illustrated by other passages or by the general tenour of the document they actually did bear it had not unquestionable voices proclaimed the cruelty and rapacity the acts of sacrilege assassination and robbery by which these treasures had been amassed <\s>

<s> equipments of the army in general and baggage of individuals had been stipulated for before now we all know that the lawful professional gains and earnings of a soldier must be small that he is not in the habit of carrying about him during actual warfare any accumulation of these or other property and that the ordinary private property which he can be supposed to have a just title to is included under the name of his baggage therefore this was something more and what it was is apparent <\s>
<s> no part of their property says the armistice shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> who does not see in these words the consciousness of guilt an indirect self betraying admission that they had in their hands treasures which might be lawfully taken from them and an anxiety to prevent that act of justice by a positive stipulation <\s>

<s> but it has been urged that the monstrousness of such a supposition precludes this interpretation renders it impossible that it could either be intended by the one party or so understood by the other <\s>
<s> what right they who signed and he who ratified this convention have to shelter themselves under this plea will appear from the 16th and 17th articles <\s>
<s> in these it is stipulated that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or accidentally in the country shall have their property of every kind moveable and immoveable guaranteed to them with liberty of retaining or disposing of it and passing the produce into france the same is stipulated article xvii for such natives of portugal as have sided with the french or occupied situations under the french government <\s>
<s> here then is a direct avowal still more monstrous that every frenchman or native of a country in alliance with france however obnoxious his crimes may have made him and every traitorous portugueze shall have his property guaranteed to him both previously to and after the reinstatement of the portugueze government by the british army <\s>
<s> now let us ask what sense the word property must have had fastened to it in these cases <\s>
<s> must it not necessarily have included all the rewards which the frenchman had received for his iniquity and the traitorous portugueze for his treason <\s>
<s> for no man would bear a part in such oppressions or would be a traitor for nothing and moreover all the rewards which the french could bestow must have been taken from the portugueze extorted from the honest and loyal to be given to the wicked and disloyal these rewards of iniquity must necessarily have been included for on our side no attempt is made at a distinction and on the side of the french the word immoveable is manifestly intended to preclude such a distinction where alone it could have been effectual <\s>
<s> property then here means possessions thus infamously acquired and in the instance of the portugueze the fundamental notion of the word is subverted for a traitor can have no property till the government of his own country has remitted the punishment due to his crimes <\s>
<s> and these wages of guilt which the master by such exactions was enabled to pay and which the servant thus earned are to be guaranteed to him by a british army <\s>
<s> where does there exist a power on earth that could confer this right <\s>
<s> if the portugueze government itself had acted in this manner it would have been guilty of wilful suicide and the nation if it had acted so of high treason against itself <\s>
<s> let it not then be said that the monstrousness of covenanting to convey along with the persons of the french their plunder secures the article from the interpretation which the people of great britain gave and which i have now proved they were bound to give to it but conceding for a moment that it was not intended that the words should bear this sense and that neither in a fair grammatical construction nor as illustrated by other passages or by the general tenour of the document they actually did bear it had not unquestionable voices proclaimed the cruelty and rapacity the acts of sacrilege assassination and robbery by which these treasures had been amassed <\s>
<s> was not the perfidy of the french army and its contempt of moral obligation both as a body and as to the individuals which composed it infamous through europe therefore the concession would signify nothing for our generals by allowing an army of this character to depart with its equipments waggons military chest and baggage had provided abundant means to enable it to carry off whatsoever it desired and thus to elude and frustrate any stipulations which might have been made for compelling it to restore that which had been so iniquitously seized <\s>
<s> and here are we brought back to the fountain head of all this baseness to that apathy and deadness to the principle of justice through the influence of which this army outlawed by its crimes was suffered to depart from the land over which it had so long tyrannized other than as a band of disarmed prisoners i maintain therefore that permission to carry off the booty was distinctly expressed and if it had not been so that the principle of justice could not here be preserved as a violation of it must necessarily have followed from other conditions of the treaty <\s>
<s> sir hew dalrymple himself before the court of inquiry has told us in two letters to generals beresford and friere that such part of the plunder as was in money it would be difficult if not impossible to identify and consequently the french could not be prevented from carrying it away with them <\s>
<s> from the same letters we learn that the french were intending to carry off a considerable part of their plunder by calling it public money and saying that it belonged to the military chest and that their evasions of the article were most shameful and evinced a want of probity and honour which was most disgraceful to them <\s>
<s> if the french had given no other proofs of their want of such virtues than those furnished by this occasion neither the portugueze nor spanish nor british nations would condemn them nor hate them as they now do; nor would this article of the convention have excited such indignation <\s>
<s> for the french by so acting could not deem themselves breaking an engagement no doubt they looked upon themselves as injured that the failure in good faith was on the part of the british and that it was in the lawlessness of power and by a mere quibble that this construction was afterwards put upon the article in question <\s>
<s> widely different from the conduct of the british was that of the spaniards in a like case with high feeling did they abating not a jot or a tittle enforce the principle of justice <\s>
<s> how says the governor of cadiz to general dupont in the same noble letter before alluded to how says he after enumerating the afflictions which his army and the tyrant who had sent it had unjustly brought upon the spanish nation for of these in their dealings with the french they never for a moment lost sight how asks he could you expect that your army should carry off from spain the fruit of its rapacity cruelty and impiety <\s>
<s> how could you conceive this possible or that we should be so stupid or senseless <\s>
<s> and this conduct is as wise in reason as it is true to nature <\s>
<s> the spanish people could have had no confidence in their government if it had not acted thus <\s>
<s> these are the sympathies which prove that a government is paternal that it makes one family with the people besides it is only by such adherence to justice that in times of like commotion popular excesses can either be mitigated or prevented <\s>
<s> if we would be efficient allies of spain nay if we would not run the risk of doing infinite harm these sentiments must not only be ours as a nation but they must pervade the hearts of our ministers and our generals our agents and our ambassadors <\s>
<s> if it be not so they who are sent abroad must either be conscious how unworthy they are and with what unworthy commissions they appear or not if they do feel this then they must hang their heads and blush for their country and themselves if they do not the spaniards must blush for them and revolt from them or what would be ten thousand times more deplorable they must purchase a reconcilement and a communion by a sacrifice of all that is excellent in themselves <\s>
<s> spain must either break down her lofty spirit her animation and fiery courage to run side by side in the same trammels with great britain or she must start off from her intended yoke fellow with contempt and aversion <\s>
<s> this is the alternative and there is no avoiding it <\s>
<s> i have yet to speak of the influence of such concessions upon the french ruler and his army <\s>
<s> with what satanic pride must he have contemplated the devotion of his servants and adherents to their law the steadiness and zeal of their perverse loyalty and the faithfulness with which they stand by him and each other <\s>
<s> how must his heart have distended with false glory while he contrasted these qualities of his subjects with the insensibility and slackness of his british enemies <\s>
<s> this notice has however no especial propriety in this place for as far as concerns bonaparte his pride and depraved confidence may be equally fed by almost all the conditions of this instrument <\s>
<s> but as to his army it is plain that the permission whether it be considered as by an express article formally granted or only involved in the general conditions of the treaty to bear away in triumph the harvest of its crimes must not only have emboldened and exalted it with arrogance and whetted its rapacity but that hereby every soldier of which this army was composed must upon his arrival in his own country have been a seed which would give back plenteously in its kind <\s>
<s> the french are at present a needy people without commerce or manufactures unsettled in their minds and debased in their morals by revolutionary practices and habits of warfare and the youth of the country are rendered desperate by oppression which leaving no choice in their occupation discharges them from all responsibility to their own consciences <\s>
<s> how powerful then must have been the action of such incitements upon a people so circumstanced <\s>
<s> the actual sight and far more the imaginary sight and handling of these treasures magnified by the romantic tales which must have been spread about them would carry into every town and village an antidote for the terrors of conscription and would rouze men like the dreams imported from the new world when the first discoverers and adventurers returned with their ingots and their gold dust their stories and their promises to inflame and madden the avarice of the old <\s>
<s> what an effect says the governor of cadiz must it have upon the people he means the spanish people to know that a single soldier was carrying away 2580 livres tournois <\s>
<s> what an effect he might have said also must it have upon the french i direct the reader's attention to this because it seems to have been overlooked and because some of the public journals speaking of the convention and no doubt uttering the sentiments of several of their readers say that they are disgusted with the transaction not because the french have been permitted to carry off a few diamonds or some ingots of silver but because we confessed by consenting to the treaty that an army of 35,000 british troops aided by the portugueze nation was not able to compel 20,000 french to surrender at discretion <\s>
<s> this is indeed the root of the evil as hath been shewn and it is the curse of this treaty that the several parts of it are of such enormity as singly to occupy the attention and to destroy comparison and coexistence <\s>
<s> but the people of great britain are disgusted both with the one and the other <\s>
<s> they bewail the violation of the principle if the value of the things carried off had been in itself trifling their grief and their indignation would have been scarcely less <\s>
<s> but it is manifest from what has been said that it was not trifling and that therefore upon that account as well as upon others this permission was no less impolitic than it was unjust and dishonourable <\s>
<s> in illustrating these articles of the armistice and convention by which the french were both expressly permitted and indirectly enabled to carry off their booty we have already seen that a concession was made which is still more enormous viz <\s>
<s> that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or resident there and all natives of portugal who have accepted situations under the french government c shall have their property of every kind guaranteed to them by the british army <\s>
<s> by articles 16th and 17th their persons are placed under the like protection <\s>
<s> the french article xvi shall be at liberty either to accompany the french army or to remain in portugal and the portugueze article xvii shall not be rendered accountable for their political conduct during the period of the occupation of the country by the french army they all are placed under the protection of the british commanders and shall sustain no injury in their property or persons <\s>
<s> i have animadverted heretofore upon the unprofessional eagerness of our generals to appear in the character of negotiators when the sword would have done them more service than the pen <\s>
<s> but if they had confined themselves to mere military regulations they might indeed with justice have been grievously censured as injudicious commanders whose notion of the honour of armies was of a low pitch and who had no conception of the peculiar nature of the service in which they were engaged but the censure must have stopped here <\s>
<s> whereas by these provisions they have shewn that they have never reflected upon the nature of military authority as contra distinguished from civil <\s>
<s> french example had so far dazzled and blinded them that the french army is suffered to denominate itself the french government and from the whole tenour of these instruments from the preamble and these articles especially it should seem that our generals fancied themselves and their army to be the british government <\s>
<s> for these regulations emanating from a mere military authority are purely civil but of such a kind that no power on earth could confer a right to establish them <\s>
<s> and this trampling upon the most sacred rights this sacrifice of the consciousness of a self preserving principle without which neither societies nor governments can exist is not made by our generals in relation to subjects of their own sovereign but to an independent nation our ally into whose territories we could not have entered but from its confidence in our friendship and good faith <\s>
<s> surely the persons who under the countenance of too high authority have talked so loudly of prejudging this question entirely overlooked or utterly forgot this part of it <\s>
<s> what have these monstrous provisions to do with the relative strength of the two armies or with any point admitting a doubt <\s>
<s> what need here of a court of judicature to settle who were the persons their names are subscribed by their own hands and to determine the quality of the thing <\s>
<s> actions and agents like these exhibited in this connection with each other must of necessity be condemned the moment they are known and to assert the contrary is to maintain that man is a being without understanding and that morality is an empty dream <\s>

<s> this is indeed the root of the evil as hath been shewn and it is the curse of this treaty that the several parts of it are of such enormity as singly to occupy the attention and to destroy comparison and coexistence <\s>

<s> in illustrating these articles of the armistice and convention by which the french were both expressly permitted and indirectly enabled to carry off their booty we have already seen that a concession was made which is still more enormous viz <\s>

<s> i have animadverted heretofore upon the unprofessional eagerness of our generals to appear in the character of negotiators when the sword would have done them more service than the pen <\s>

<s> french example had so far dazzled and blinded them that the french army is suffered to denominate itself the french government and from the whole tenour of these instruments from the preamble and these articles especially it should seem that our generals fancied themselves and their army to be the british government <\s>
<s> for these regulations emanating from a mere military authority are purely civil but of such a kind that no power on earth could confer a right to establish them <\s>
<s> and this trampling upon the most sacred rights this sacrifice of the consciousness of a self preserving principle without which neither societies nor governments can exist is not made by our generals in relation to subjects of their own sovereign but to an independent nation our ally into whose territories we could not have entered but from its confidence in our friendship and good faith <\s>
<s> surely the persons who under the countenance of too high authority have talked so loudly of prejudging this question entirely overlooked or utterly forgot this part of it <\s>
<s> what have these monstrous provisions to do with the relative strength of the two armies or with any point admitting a doubt <\s>
<s> what need here of a court of judicature to settle who were the persons their names are subscribed by their own hands and to determine the quality of the thing <\s>
<s> actions and agents like these exhibited in this connection with each other must of necessity be condemned the moment they are known and to assert the contrary is to maintain that man is a being without understanding and that morality is an empty dream <\s>
<s> and if this condemnation must after this manner follow to utter it is less a duty than a further inevitable consequence from the constitution of human nature <\s>
<s> they who hold that the formal sanction of a court of judicature is in this case required before a people has a right to pass sentence know not to what degree they are enemies to that people and to mankind to what degree selfishness whether arising from their peculiar situation or from other causes has in them prevailed over those faculties which are our common inheritance and cut them off from fellowship with the species <\s>
<s> most deplorable would be the result if it were possible that the injunctions of these men could be obeyed or their remonstrances acknowledged to be just <\s>
<s> for not to mention that if it were not for such prompt decisions of the public voice misdemeanours of men high in office would rarely be accounted for at all we must bear in mind at this crisis that the adversary of all good is hourly and daily extending his ravages and according to such notions of fitness our indignation our sorrow our shame our sense of right and wrong and all those moral affections and powers of the understanding by which alone he can be effectually opposed are to enter upon a long vacation their motion is to be suspended a thing impossible if it could it would be destroyed <\s>
<s> let us now see what language the portugueze speak upon that part of the treaty which has incited me to give vent to these feelings and to assert these truths <\s>
<s> i protest says general friere against article xvii one of the two now under examination because it attempts to tie down the government of this kingdom not to bring to justice and condign punishment those persons who have been notoriously and scandalously disloyal to their prince and the country by joining and serving the french party and even if the english army should be allowed to screen them from the punishment they have deserved still it should not prevent their expulsion whereby this country would no longer have to fear being again betrayed by the same men <\s>
<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>
<s> couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange <\s>
<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>
<s> which amounts to this <\s>
<s> the french are called upon formally to relinquish in favour of the portugueze that to which they never had any right to abandon false claims which they either had a power to enforce or they had not if they departed immediately and had not power the article was nugatory if they remained a day longer and had power there was no security that they would abide by it <\s>
<s> accordingly loud complaints were made that after the date of the convention all kinds of ravages were committed by the french upon lisbon and its neighbourhood and what did it matter whether these were upon the plea of old debts and requisitions or new debts were created more greedily than ever from the consciousness that the time for collecting them was so short <\s>
<s> this article then the only one which is even in shew favourable to the portugueze is in substance nothing inasmuch as in what it is silent upon viz <\s>
<s> that the people of lisbon and its neighbourhood shall not be vexed and oppressed by the french during their stay with new claims and robberies it is grossly cruel or negligent and in that for which it actually stipulates wholly delusive <\s>
<s> it is in fact insulting for the very admission of a formal renunciation of these claims does to a certain degree acknowledge their justice <\s>
<s> the only decent manner of introducing matter to this effect would have been by placing it as a bye clause of a provision that secured the portugueze from further molestations and merely alluding to it as a thing understood of course <\s>
<s> yet from the place which this specious article occupies preceding immediately the 16th and 17th which we have been last considering it is clear that it must have been intended by the french general as honey smeared upon the edge of the cup to make the poison contained in those two more palateable <\s>
<s> thus much for the portugueze and their particular interests <\s>
<s> in one instance a concern of the spanish nation comes directly under notice and that nation also is treated without delicacy or feeling <\s>
<s> for by the 18th article it is agreed that the spaniards 4000 in number who had been disarmed and were confined on ship board in the port of lisbon by the french should be liberated <\s>
<s> and upon what consideration <\s>
<s> not upon their right to be free as having been treacherously and cruelly dealt with by men who were part of a power that was labouring to subjugate their country and in this attempt had committed inhuman crimes against it not even exchanged as soldiers against soldiers but the condition of their emancipation is that the british general engages to obtain of the spaniards to restore such french subjects either military or civil as have been detained in spain without having been taken in battle or in consequence of military operations but on account of the occurrences of the 29th of last may and the days immediately following <\s>
<s> i know not what are exactly the features of the face for which this word serves as a veil i have no register at hand to inform me what these events precisely were but there can be no doubt that it was a time of triumph for liberty and humanity and that the persons for whom these noble minded spaniards were to be exchanged were no other than a horde from among the most abject of the french nation probably those wretches who having never faced either the dangers or the fatigues of war had been most busy in secret preparations or were most conspicuous in open acts of massacre when the streets of madrid a few weeks before had been drenched with the blood of two thousand of her bravest citizens <\s>
<s> yet the liberation of these spaniards upon these terms is recorded in the report of the court of enquiry as one of the advantages which in the contemplation of the generals would result from the convention <\s>
<s> finally if there shall be any doubt article xiv as to the meaning of any article it shall be explained favourably to the french army and hostages article xx of the rank of field officers on the part of the british army and navy shall be furnished for the guarantee of the present convention <\s>
<s> i have now gone through the painful task of examining the most material conditions of the convention of cintra the whole number of the articles is twenty two with three additional ones a long ladder into a deep abyss of infamy need it be said that neglects injuries and insults like these which we have been contemplating come from what quarter they may let them be exhibited towards whom they will must produce not merely mistrust and jealousy but alienation and hatred <\s>
<s> the passions and feelings may be quieted or diverted for a short time but though out of sight or seemingly asleep they must exist and the life which they have received cannot but by a long course of justice and kindness be overcome and destroyed <\s>
<s> but why talk of a long course of justice and kindness when the immediate result must have been so deplorable <\s>
<s> relying upon our humanity our fellow feeling and our justice upon these instant and urgent claims sanctioned by the more mild one of ancient alliance the portugueze people by voices from every part of their land entreated our succour the arrival of a british army upon their coasts was joyfully hailed and the people of the country zealously assisted in landing the troops without which help as a british general has informed us that landing could not have been effected <\s>
<s> and it is in this manner that they are repaid <\s>
<s> to some port between rochefort and l'orient and be at liberty to serve i come to that memorable condition article v that the french army shall carry with it all its equipments that is to say its military chests and carriages attached to the field commissariat and field hospitals or shall be allowed to dispose of such part as the commander in chief may judge it unnecessary to embark <\s>
<s> in like manner all individuals of the army shall be at liberty to dispose of their private property of every description with full security hereafter for the purchasers <\s>
<s> this is expressed still more pointedly in the armistice though the meaning implied in the two articles is precisely the same <\s>
<s> for in the fifth article of the armistice it is agreed provisionally that all those of whom the french army consists shall be conveyed to france with arms and baggage and all their private property of every description no part of which shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> in the convention it is only expressed that they shall be at liberty to depart article ii with arms and baggage and article v to dispose of their private property of every description <\s>
<s> but if they had a right to dispose of it this would include a right to carry it away which was undoubtedly understood by the french general <\s>
<s> and in the armistice it is expressly said that their private property of every description shall be conveyed to france along with their persons <\s>
<s> what then are we to understand by the words their private property of every description <\s>
<s> equipments of the army in general and baggage of individuals had been stipulated for before now we all know that the lawful professional gains and earnings of a soldier must be small that he is not in the habit of carrying about him during actual warfare any accumulation of these or other property and that the ordinary private property which he can be supposed to have a just title to is included under the name of his baggage therefore this was something more and what it was is apparent <\s>
<s> no part of their property says the armistice shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> who does not see in these words the consciousness of guilt an indirect self betraying admission that they had in their hands treasures which might be lawfully taken from them and an anxiety to prevent that act of justice by a positive stipulation <\s>
<s> who does not see on what sort of property the frenchman had his eye that it was not property by right but their possessions their plunder every thing by what means soever acquired that the french army or any individual in it was possessed of <\s>
<s> but it has been urged that the monstrousness of such a supposition precludes this interpretation renders it impossible that it could either be intended by the one party or so understood by the other <\s>
<s> what right they who signed and he who ratified this convention have to shelter themselves under this plea will appear from the 16th and 17th articles <\s>
<s> in these it is stipulated that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or accidentally in the country shall have their property of every kind moveable and immoveable guaranteed to them with liberty of retaining or disposing of it and passing the produce into france the same is stipulated article xvii for such natives of portugal as have sided with the french or occupied situations under the french government <\s>
<s> here then is a direct avowal still more monstrous that every frenchman or native of a country in alliance with france however obnoxious his crimes may have made him and every traitorous portugueze shall have his property guaranteed to him both previously to and after the reinstatement of the portugueze government by the british army <\s>

<s> and these wages of guilt which the master by such exactions was enabled to pay and which the servant thus earned are to be guaranteed to him by a british army <\s>

<s> in like manner all individuals of the army shall be at liberty to dispose of their private property of every description with full security hereafter for the purchasers <\s>
<s> this is expressed still more pointedly in the armistice though the meaning implied in the two articles is precisely the same <\s>

<s> and in the armistice it is expressly said that their private property of every description shall be conveyed to france along with their persons <\s>
<s> what then are we to understand by the words their private property of every description <\s>
<s> equipments of the army in general and baggage of individuals had been stipulated for before now we all know that the lawful professional gains and earnings of a soldier must be small that he is not in the habit of carrying about him during actual warfare any accumulation of these or other property and that the ordinary private property which he can be supposed to have a just title to is included under the name of his baggage therefore this was something more and what it was is apparent <\s>
<s> no part of their property says the armistice shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> who does not see in these words the consciousness of guilt an indirect self betraying admission that they had in their hands treasures which might be lawfully taken from them and an anxiety to prevent that act of justice by a positive stipulation <\s>
<s> who does not see on what sort of property the frenchman had his eye that it was not property by right but their possessions their plunder every thing by what means soever acquired that the french army or any individual in it was possessed of <\s>
<s> but it has been urged that the monstrousness of such a supposition precludes this interpretation renders it impossible that it could either be intended by the one party or so understood by the other <\s>
<s> what right they who signed and he who ratified this convention have to shelter themselves under this plea will appear from the 16th and 17th articles <\s>
<s> in these it is stipulated that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or accidentally in the country shall have their property of every kind moveable and immoveable guaranteed to them with liberty of retaining or disposing of it and passing the produce into france the same is stipulated article xvii for such natives of portugal as have sided with the french or occupied situations under the french government <\s>
<s> here then is a direct avowal still more monstrous that every frenchman or native of a country in alliance with france however obnoxious his crimes may have made him and every traitorous portugueze shall have his property guaranteed to him both previously to and after the reinstatement of the portugueze government by the british army <\s>
<s> now let us ask what sense the word property must have had fastened to it in these cases <\s>
<s> must it not necessarily have included all the rewards which the frenchman had received for his iniquity and the traitorous portugueze for his treason <\s>
<s> for no man would bear a part in such oppressions or would be a traitor for nothing and moreover all the rewards which the french could bestow must have been taken from the portugueze extorted from the honest and loyal to be given to the wicked and disloyal these rewards of iniquity must necessarily have been included for on our side no attempt is made at a distinction and on the side of the french the word immoveable is manifestly intended to preclude such a distinction where alone it could have been effectual <\s>
<s> property then here means possessions thus infamously acquired and in the instance of the portugueze the fundamental notion of the word is subverted for a traitor can have no property till the government of his own country has remitted the punishment due to his crimes <\s>
<s> and these wages of guilt which the master by such exactions was enabled to pay and which the servant thus earned are to be guaranteed to him by a british army <\s>
<s> where does there exist a power on earth that could confer this right <\s>
<s> if the portugueze government itself had acted in this manner it would have been guilty of wilful suicide and the nation if it had acted so of high treason against itself <\s>
<s> let it not then be said that the monstrousness of covenanting to convey along with the persons of the french their plunder secures the article from the interpretation which the people of great britain gave and which i have now proved they were bound to give to it but conceding for a moment that it was not intended that the words should bear this sense and that neither in a fair grammatical construction nor as illustrated by other passages or by the general tenour of the document they actually did bear it had not unquestionable voices proclaimed the cruelty and rapacity the acts of sacrilege assassination and robbery by which these treasures had been amassed <\s>
<s> was not the perfidy of the french army and its contempt of moral obligation both as a body and as to the individuals which composed it infamous through europe therefore the concession would signify nothing for our generals by allowing an army of this character to depart with its equipments waggons military chest and baggage had provided abundant means to enable it to carry off whatsoever it desired and thus to elude and frustrate any stipulations which might have been made for compelling it to restore that which had been so iniquitously seized <\s>
<s> and here are we brought back to the fountain head of all this baseness to that apathy and deadness to the principle of justice through the influence of which this army outlawed by its crimes was suffered to depart from the land over which it had so long tyrannized other than as a band of disarmed prisoners i maintain therefore that permission to carry off the booty was distinctly expressed and if it had not been so that the principle of justice could not here be preserved as a violation of it must necessarily have followed from other conditions of the treaty <\s>
<s> sir hew dalrymple himself before the court of inquiry has told us in two letters to generals beresford and friere that such part of the plunder as was in money it would be difficult if not impossible to identify and consequently the french could not be prevented from carrying it away with them <\s>
<s> from the same letters we learn that the french were intending to carry off a considerable part of their plunder by calling it public money and saying that it belonged to the military chest and that their evasions of the article were most shameful and evinced a want of probity and honour which was most disgraceful to them <\s>
<s> if the french had given no other proofs of their want of such virtues than those furnished by this occasion neither the portugueze nor spanish nor british nations would condemn them nor hate them as they now do; nor would this article of the convention have excited such indignation <\s>
<s> for the french by so acting could not deem themselves breaking an engagement no doubt they looked upon themselves as injured that the failure in good faith was on the part of the british and that it was in the lawlessness of power and by a mere quibble that this construction was afterwards put upon the article in question <\s>
<s> widely different from the conduct of the british was that of the spaniards in a like case with high feeling did they abating not a jot or a tittle enforce the principle of justice <\s>
<s> how says the governor of cadiz to general dupont in the same noble letter before alluded to how says he after enumerating the afflictions which his army and the tyrant who had sent it had unjustly brought upon the spanish nation for of these in their dealings with the french they never for a moment lost sight how asks he could you expect that your army should carry off from spain the fruit of its rapacity cruelty and impiety <\s>
<s> how could you conceive this possible or that we should be so stupid or senseless <\s>
<s> and this conduct is as wise in reason as it is true to nature <\s>
<s> the spanish people could have had no confidence in their government if it had not acted thus <\s>
<s> these are the sympathies which prove that a government is paternal that it makes one family with the people besides it is only by such adherence to justice that in times of like commotion popular excesses can either be mitigated or prevented <\s>
<s> if we would be efficient allies of spain nay if we would not run the risk of doing infinite harm these sentiments must not only be ours as a nation but they must pervade the hearts of our ministers and our generals our agents and our ambassadors <\s>
<s> if it be not so they who are sent abroad must either be conscious how unworthy they are and with what unworthy commissions they appear or not if they do feel this then they must hang their heads and blush for their country and themselves if they do not the spaniards must blush for them and revolt from them or what would be ten thousand times more deplorable they must purchase a reconcilement and a communion by a sacrifice of all that is excellent in themselves <\s>
<s> spain must either break down her lofty spirit her animation and fiery courage to run side by side in the same trammels with great britain or she must start off from her intended yoke fellow with contempt and aversion <\s>
<s> this is the alternative and there is no avoiding it <\s>
<s> i have yet to speak of the influence of such concessions upon the french ruler and his army <\s>
<s> with what satanic pride must he have contemplated the devotion of his servants and adherents to their law the steadiness and zeal of their perverse loyalty and the faithfulness with which they stand by him and each other <\s>
<s> how must his heart have distended with false glory while he contrasted these qualities of his subjects with the insensibility and slackness of his british enemies <\s>
<s> this notice has however no especial propriety in this place for as far as concerns bonaparte his pride and depraved confidence may be equally fed by almost all the conditions of this instrument <\s>
<s> but as to his army it is plain that the permission whether it be considered as by an express article formally granted or only involved in the general conditions of the treaty to bear away in triumph the harvest of its crimes must not only have emboldened and exalted it with arrogance and whetted its rapacity but that hereby every soldier of which this army was composed must upon his arrival in his own country have been a seed which would give back plenteously in its kind <\s>
<s> the french are at present a needy people without commerce or manufactures unsettled in their minds and debased in their morals by revolutionary practices and habits of warfare and the youth of the country are rendered desperate by oppression which leaving no choice in their occupation discharges them from all responsibility to their own consciences <\s>
<s> how powerful then must have been the action of such incitements upon a people so circumstanced <\s>
<s> the actual sight and far more the imaginary sight and handling of these treasures magnified by the romantic tales which must have been spread about them would carry into every town and village an antidote for the terrors of conscription and would rouze men like the dreams imported from the new world when the first discoverers and adventurers returned with their ingots and their gold dust their stories and their promises to inflame and madden the avarice of the old <\s>
<s> what an effect says the governor of cadiz must it have upon the people he means the spanish people to know that a single soldier was carrying away 2580 livres tournois <\s>
<s> what an effect he might have said also must it have upon the french i direct the reader's attention to this because it seems to have been overlooked and because some of the public journals speaking of the convention and no doubt uttering the sentiments of several of their readers say that they are disgusted with the transaction not because the french have been permitted to carry off a few diamonds or some ingots of silver but because we confessed by consenting to the treaty that an army of 35,000 british troops aided by the portugueze nation was not able to compel 20,000 french to surrender at discretion <\s>
<s> this is indeed the root of the evil as hath been shewn and it is the curse of this treaty that the several parts of it are of such enormity as singly to occupy the attention and to destroy comparison and coexistence <\s>
<s> but the people of great britain are disgusted both with the one and the other <\s>
<s> they bewail the violation of the principle if the value of the things carried off had been in itself trifling their grief and their indignation would have been scarcely less <\s>
<s> but it is manifest from what has been said that it was not trifling and that therefore upon that account as well as upon others this permission was no less impolitic than it was unjust and dishonourable <\s>
<s> in illustrating these articles of the armistice and convention by which the french were both expressly permitted and indirectly enabled to carry off their booty we have already seen that a concession was made which is still more enormous viz <\s>
<s> that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or resident there and all natives of portugal who have accepted situations under the french government c shall have their property of every kind guaranteed to them by the british army <\s>
<s> by articles 16th and 17th their persons are placed under the like protection <\s>
<s> the french article xvi shall be at liberty either to accompany the french army or to remain in portugal and the portugueze article xvii shall not be rendered accountable for their political conduct during the period of the occupation of the country by the french army they all are placed under the protection of the british commanders and shall sustain no injury in their property or persons <\s>
<s> i have animadverted heretofore upon the unprofessional eagerness of our generals to appear in the character of negotiators when the sword would have done them more service than the pen <\s>
<s> but if they had confined themselves to mere military regulations they might indeed with justice have been grievously censured as injudicious commanders whose notion of the honour of armies was of a low pitch and who had no conception of the peculiar nature of the service in which they were engaged but the censure must have stopped here <\s>
<s> whereas by these provisions they have shewn that they have never reflected upon the nature of military authority as contra distinguished from civil <\s>
<s> french example had so far dazzled and blinded them that the french army is suffered to denominate itself the french government and from the whole tenour of these instruments from the preamble and these articles especially it should seem that our generals fancied themselves and their army to be the british government <\s>

<s> this is indeed the root of the evil as hath been shewn and it is the curse of this treaty that the several parts of it are of such enormity as singly to occupy the attention and to destroy comparison and coexistence <\s>

<s> but it is manifest from what has been said that it was not trifling and that therefore upon that account as well as upon others this permission was no less impolitic than it was unjust and dishonourable <\s>
<s> in illustrating these articles of the armistice and convention by which the french were both expressly permitted and indirectly enabled to carry off their booty we have already seen that a concession was made which is still more enormous viz <\s>
<s> that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or resident there and all natives of portugal who have accepted situations under the french government c shall have their property of every kind guaranteed to them by the british army <\s>
<s> by articles 16th and 17th their persons are placed under the like protection <\s>

<s> i have animadverted heretofore upon the unprofessional eagerness of our generals to appear in the character of negotiators when the sword would have done them more service than the pen <\s>
<s> but if they had confined themselves to mere military regulations they might indeed with justice have been grievously censured as injudicious commanders whose notion of the honour of armies was of a low pitch and who had no conception of the peculiar nature of the service in which they were engaged but the censure must have stopped here <\s>
<s> whereas by these provisions they have shewn that they have never reflected upon the nature of military authority as contra distinguished from civil <\s>
<s> french example had so far dazzled and blinded them that the french army is suffered to denominate itself the french government and from the whole tenour of these instruments from the preamble and these articles especially it should seem that our generals fancied themselves and their army to be the british government <\s>
<s> for these regulations emanating from a mere military authority are purely civil but of such a kind that no power on earth could confer a right to establish them <\s>
<s> and this trampling upon the most sacred rights this sacrifice of the consciousness of a self preserving principle without which neither societies nor governments can exist is not made by our generals in relation to subjects of their own sovereign but to an independent nation our ally into whose territories we could not have entered but from its confidence in our friendship and good faith <\s>
<s> surely the persons who under the countenance of too high authority have talked so loudly of prejudging this question entirely overlooked or utterly forgot this part of it <\s>
<s> what have these monstrous provisions to do with the relative strength of the two armies or with any point admitting a doubt <\s>
<s> what need here of a court of judicature to settle who were the persons their names are subscribed by their own hands and to determine the quality of the thing <\s>
<s> actions and agents like these exhibited in this connection with each other must of necessity be condemned the moment they are known and to assert the contrary is to maintain that man is a being without understanding and that morality is an empty dream <\s>
<s> and if this condemnation must after this manner follow to utter it is less a duty than a further inevitable consequence from the constitution of human nature <\s>
<s> they who hold that the formal sanction of a court of judicature is in this case required before a people has a right to pass sentence know not to what degree they are enemies to that people and to mankind to what degree selfishness whether arising from their peculiar situation or from other causes has in them prevailed over those faculties which are our common inheritance and cut them off from fellowship with the species <\s>
<s> most deplorable would be the result if it were possible that the injunctions of these men could be obeyed or their remonstrances acknowledged to be just <\s>
<s> for not to mention that if it were not for such prompt decisions of the public voice misdemeanours of men high in office would rarely be accounted for at all we must bear in mind at this crisis that the adversary of all good is hourly and daily extending his ravages and according to such notions of fitness our indignation our sorrow our shame our sense of right and wrong and all those moral affections and powers of the understanding by which alone he can be effectually opposed are to enter upon a long vacation their motion is to be suspended a thing impossible if it could it would be destroyed <\s>
<s> let us now see what language the portugueze speak upon that part of the treaty which has incited me to give vent to these feelings and to assert these truths <\s>
<s> i protest says general friere against article xvii one of the two now under examination because it attempts to tie down the government of this kingdom not to bring to justice and condign punishment those persons who have been notoriously and scandalously disloyal to their prince and the country by joining and serving the french party and even if the english army should be allowed to screen them from the punishment they have deserved still it should not prevent their expulsion whereby this country would no longer have to fear being again betrayed by the same men <\s>
<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>
<s> couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange <\s>
<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>
<s> which amounts to this <\s>
<s> the french are called upon formally to relinquish in favour of the portugueze that to which they never had any right to abandon false claims which they either had a power to enforce or they had not if they departed immediately and had not power the article was nugatory if they remained a day longer and had power there was no security that they would abide by it <\s>
<s> accordingly loud complaints were made that after the date of the convention all kinds of ravages were committed by the french upon lisbon and its neighbourhood and what did it matter whether these were upon the plea of old debts and requisitions or new debts were created more greedily than ever from the consciousness that the time for collecting them was so short <\s>
<s> this article then the only one which is even in shew favourable to the portugueze is in substance nothing inasmuch as in what it is silent upon viz <\s>
<s> that the people of lisbon and its neighbourhood shall not be vexed and oppressed by the french during their stay with new claims and robberies it is grossly cruel or negligent and in that for which it actually stipulates wholly delusive <\s>
<s> it is in fact insulting for the very admission of a formal renunciation of these claims does to a certain degree acknowledge their justice <\s>
<s> the only decent manner of introducing matter to this effect would have been by placing it as a bye clause of a provision that secured the portugueze from further molestations and merely alluding to it as a thing understood of course <\s>
<s> yet from the place which this specious article occupies preceding immediately the 16th and 17th which we have been last considering it is clear that it must have been intended by the french general as honey smeared upon the edge of the cup to make the poison contained in those two more palateable <\s>
<s> thus much for the portugueze and their particular interests <\s>
<s> in one instance a concern of the spanish nation comes directly under notice and that nation also is treated without delicacy or feeling <\s>
<s> for by the 18th article it is agreed that the spaniards 4000 in number who had been disarmed and were confined on ship board in the port of lisbon by the french should be liberated <\s>
<s> and upon what consideration <\s>
<s> not upon their right to be free as having been treacherously and cruelly dealt with by men who were part of a power that was labouring to subjugate their country and in this attempt had committed inhuman crimes against it not even exchanged as soldiers against soldiers but the condition of their emancipation is that the british general engages to obtain of the spaniards to restore such french subjects either military or civil as have been detained in spain without having been taken in battle or in consequence of military operations but on account of the occurrences of the 29th of last may and the days immediately following <\s>
<s> i know not what are exactly the features of the face for which this word serves as a veil i have no register at hand to inform me what these events precisely were but there can be no doubt that it was a time of triumph for liberty and humanity and that the persons for whom these noble minded spaniards were to be exchanged were no other than a horde from among the most abject of the french nation probably those wretches who having never faced either the dangers or the fatigues of war had been most busy in secret preparations or were most conspicuous in open acts of massacre when the streets of madrid a few weeks before had been drenched with the blood of two thousand of her bravest citizens <\s>
<s> yet the liberation of these spaniards upon these terms is recorded in the report of the court of enquiry as one of the advantages which in the contemplation of the generals would result from the convention <\s>
<s> finally if there shall be any doubt article xiv as to the meaning of any article it shall be explained favourably to the french army and hostages article xx of the rank of field officers on the part of the british army and navy shall be furnished for the guarantee of the present convention <\s>
<s> i have now gone through the painful task of examining the most material conditions of the convention of cintra the whole number of the articles is twenty two with three additional ones a long ladder into a deep abyss of infamy need it be said that neglects injuries and insults like these which we have been contemplating come from what quarter they may let them be exhibited towards whom they will must produce not merely mistrust and jealousy but alienation and hatred <\s>
<s> the passions and feelings may be quieted or diverted for a short time but though out of sight or seemingly asleep they must exist and the life which they have received cannot but by a long course of justice and kindness be overcome and destroyed <\s>
<s> but why talk of a long course of justice and kindness when the immediate result must have been so deplorable <\s>
<s> relying upon our humanity our fellow feeling and our justice upon these instant and urgent claims sanctioned by the more mild one of ancient alliance the portugueze people by voices from every part of their land entreated our succour the arrival of a british army upon their coasts was joyfully hailed and the people of the country zealously assisted in landing the troops without which help as a british general has informed us that landing could not have been effected <\s>
<s> and it is in this manner that they are repaid <\s>
<s> to some port between rochefort and l'orient and be at liberty to serve i come to that memorable condition article v that the french army shall carry with it all its equipments that is to say its military chests and carriages attached to the field commissariat and field hospitals or shall be allowed to dispose of such part as the commander in chief may judge it unnecessary to embark <\s>
<s> in like manner all individuals of the army shall be at liberty to dispose of their private property of every description with full security hereafter for the purchasers <\s>
<s> this is expressed still more pointedly in the armistice though the meaning implied in the two articles is precisely the same <\s>
<s> for in the fifth article of the armistice it is agreed provisionally that all those of whom the french army consists shall be conveyed to france with arms and baggage and all their private property of every description no part of which shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> in the convention it is only expressed that they shall be at liberty to depart article ii with arms and baggage and article v to dispose of their private property of every description <\s>
<s> but if they had a right to dispose of it this would include a right to carry it away which was undoubtedly understood by the french general <\s>
<s> and in the armistice it is expressly said that their private property of every description shall be conveyed to france along with their persons <\s>
<s> what then are we to understand by the words their private property of every description <\s>
<s> equipments of the army in general and baggage of individuals had been stipulated for before now we all know that the lawful professional gains and earnings of a soldier must be small that he is not in the habit of carrying about him during actual warfare any accumulation of these or other property and that the ordinary private property which he can be supposed to have a just title to is included under the name of his baggage therefore this was something more and what it was is apparent <\s>
<s> no part of their property says the armistice shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> who does not see in these words the consciousness of guilt an indirect self betraying admission that they had in their hands treasures which might be lawfully taken from them and an anxiety to prevent that act of justice by a positive stipulation <\s>
<s> who does not see on what sort of property the frenchman had his eye that it was not property by right but their possessions their plunder every thing by what means soever acquired that the french army or any individual in it was possessed of <\s>

<s> here then is a direct avowal still more monstrous that every frenchman or native of a country in alliance with france however obnoxious his crimes may have made him and every traitorous portugueze shall have his property guaranteed to him both previously to and after the reinstatement of the portugueze government by the british army <\s>

<s> in like manner all individuals of the army shall be at liberty to dispose of their private property of every description with full security hereafter for the purchasers <\s>
<s> this is expressed still more pointedly in the armistice though the meaning implied in the two articles is precisely the same <\s>
<s> for in the fifth article of the armistice it is agreed provisionally that all those of whom the french army consists shall be conveyed to france with arms and baggage and all their private property of every description no part of which shall be wrested from them <\s>

<s> but if they had a right to dispose of it this would include a right to carry it away which was undoubtedly understood by the french general <\s>
<s> and in the armistice it is expressly said that their private property of every description shall be conveyed to france along with their persons <\s>
<s> what then are we to understand by the words their private property of every description <\s>
<s> equipments of the army in general and baggage of individuals had been stipulated for before now we all know that the lawful professional gains and earnings of a soldier must be small that he is not in the habit of carrying about him during actual warfare any accumulation of these or other property and that the ordinary private property which he can be supposed to have a just title to is included under the name of his baggage therefore this was something more and what it was is apparent <\s>
<s> no part of their property says the armistice shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> who does not see in these words the consciousness of guilt an indirect self betraying admission that they had in their hands treasures which might be lawfully taken from them and an anxiety to prevent that act of justice by a positive stipulation <\s>
<s> who does not see on what sort of property the frenchman had his eye that it was not property by right but their possessions their plunder every thing by what means soever acquired that the french army or any individual in it was possessed of <\s>
<s> but it has been urged that the monstrousness of such a supposition precludes this interpretation renders it impossible that it could either be intended by the one party or so understood by the other <\s>
<s> what right they who signed and he who ratified this convention have to shelter themselves under this plea will appear from the 16th and 17th articles <\s>
<s> in these it is stipulated that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or accidentally in the country shall have their property of every kind moveable and immoveable guaranteed to them with liberty of retaining or disposing of it and passing the produce into france the same is stipulated article xvii for such natives of portugal as have sided with the french or occupied situations under the french government <\s>
<s> here then is a direct avowal still more monstrous that every frenchman or native of a country in alliance with france however obnoxious his crimes may have made him and every traitorous portugueze shall have his property guaranteed to him both previously to and after the reinstatement of the portugueze government by the british army <\s>
<s> now let us ask what sense the word property must have had fastened to it in these cases <\s>
<s> must it not necessarily have included all the rewards which the frenchman had received for his iniquity and the traitorous portugueze for his treason <\s>
<s> for no man would bear a part in such oppressions or would be a traitor for nothing and moreover all the rewards which the french could bestow must have been taken from the portugueze extorted from the honest and loyal to be given to the wicked and disloyal these rewards of iniquity must necessarily have been included for on our side no attempt is made at a distinction and on the side of the french the word immoveable is manifestly intended to preclude such a distinction where alone it could have been effectual <\s>
<s> property then here means possessions thus infamously acquired and in the instance of the portugueze the fundamental notion of the word is subverted for a traitor can have no property till the government of his own country has remitted the punishment due to his crimes <\s>
<s> and these wages of guilt which the master by such exactions was enabled to pay and which the servant thus earned are to be guaranteed to him by a british army <\s>
<s> where does there exist a power on earth that could confer this right <\s>
<s> if the portugueze government itself had acted in this manner it would have been guilty of wilful suicide and the nation if it had acted so of high treason against itself <\s>
<s> let it not then be said that the monstrousness of covenanting to convey along with the persons of the french their plunder secures the article from the interpretation which the people of great britain gave and which i have now proved they were bound to give to it but conceding for a moment that it was not intended that the words should bear this sense and that neither in a fair grammatical construction nor as illustrated by other passages or by the general tenour of the document they actually did bear it had not unquestionable voices proclaimed the cruelty and rapacity the acts of sacrilege assassination and robbery by which these treasures had been amassed <\s>
<s> was not the perfidy of the french army and its contempt of moral obligation both as a body and as to the individuals which composed it infamous through europe therefore the concession would signify nothing for our generals by allowing an army of this character to depart with its equipments waggons military chest and baggage had provided abundant means to enable it to carry off whatsoever it desired and thus to elude and frustrate any stipulations which might have been made for compelling it to restore that which had been so iniquitously seized <\s>
<s> and here are we brought back to the fountain head of all this baseness to that apathy and deadness to the principle of justice through the influence of which this army outlawed by its crimes was suffered to depart from the land over which it had so long tyrannized other than as a band of disarmed prisoners i maintain therefore that permission to carry off the booty was distinctly expressed and if it had not been so that the principle of justice could not here be preserved as a violation of it must necessarily have followed from other conditions of the treaty <\s>
<s> sir hew dalrymple himself before the court of inquiry has told us in two letters to generals beresford and friere that such part of the plunder as was in money it would be difficult if not impossible to identify and consequently the french could not be prevented from carrying it away with them <\s>
<s> from the same letters we learn that the french were intending to carry off a considerable part of their plunder by calling it public money and saying that it belonged to the military chest and that their evasions of the article were most shameful and evinced a want of probity and honour which was most disgraceful to them <\s>
<s> if the french had given no other proofs of their want of such virtues than those furnished by this occasion neither the portugueze nor spanish nor british nations would condemn them nor hate them as they now do; nor would this article of the convention have excited such indignation <\s>
<s> for the french by so acting could not deem themselves breaking an engagement no doubt they looked upon themselves as injured that the failure in good faith was on the part of the british and that it was in the lawlessness of power and by a mere quibble that this construction was afterwards put upon the article in question <\s>
<s> widely different from the conduct of the british was that of the spaniards in a like case with high feeling did they abating not a jot or a tittle enforce the principle of justice <\s>
<s> how says the governor of cadiz to general dupont in the same noble letter before alluded to how says he after enumerating the afflictions which his army and the tyrant who had sent it had unjustly brought upon the spanish nation for of these in their dealings with the french they never for a moment lost sight how asks he could you expect that your army should carry off from spain the fruit of its rapacity cruelty and impiety <\s>
<s> how could you conceive this possible or that we should be so stupid or senseless <\s>
<s> and this conduct is as wise in reason as it is true to nature <\s>
<s> the spanish people could have had no confidence in their government if it had not acted thus <\s>
<s> these are the sympathies which prove that a government is paternal that it makes one family with the people besides it is only by such adherence to justice that in times of like commotion popular excesses can either be mitigated or prevented <\s>
<s> if we would be efficient allies of spain nay if we would not run the risk of doing infinite harm these sentiments must not only be ours as a nation but they must pervade the hearts of our ministers and our generals our agents and our ambassadors <\s>
<s> if it be not so they who are sent abroad must either be conscious how unworthy they are and with what unworthy commissions they appear or not if they do feel this then they must hang their heads and blush for their country and themselves if they do not the spaniards must blush for them and revolt from them or what would be ten thousand times more deplorable they must purchase a reconcilement and a communion by a sacrifice of all that is excellent in themselves <\s>
<s> spain must either break down her lofty spirit her animation and fiery courage to run side by side in the same trammels with great britain or she must start off from her intended yoke fellow with contempt and aversion <\s>
<s> this is the alternative and there is no avoiding it <\s>
<s> i have yet to speak of the influence of such concessions upon the french ruler and his army <\s>
<s> with what satanic pride must he have contemplated the devotion of his servants and adherents to their law the steadiness and zeal of their perverse loyalty and the faithfulness with which they stand by him and each other <\s>
<s> how must his heart have distended with false glory while he contrasted these qualities of his subjects with the insensibility and slackness of his british enemies <\s>
<s> this notice has however no especial propriety in this place for as far as concerns bonaparte his pride and depraved confidence may be equally fed by almost all the conditions of this instrument <\s>
<s> but as to his army it is plain that the permission whether it be considered as by an express article formally granted or only involved in the general conditions of the treaty to bear away in triumph the harvest of its crimes must not only have emboldened and exalted it with arrogance and whetted its rapacity but that hereby every soldier of which this army was composed must upon his arrival in his own country have been a seed which would give back plenteously in its kind <\s>
<s> the french are at present a needy people without commerce or manufactures unsettled in their minds and debased in their morals by revolutionary practices and habits of warfare and the youth of the country are rendered desperate by oppression which leaving no choice in their occupation discharges them from all responsibility to their own consciences <\s>
<s> how powerful then must have been the action of such incitements upon a people so circumstanced <\s>
<s> the actual sight and far more the imaginary sight and handling of these treasures magnified by the romantic tales which must have been spread about them would carry into every town and village an antidote for the terrors of conscription and would rouze men like the dreams imported from the new world when the first discoverers and adventurers returned with their ingots and their gold dust their stories and their promises to inflame and madden the avarice of the old <\s>
<s> what an effect says the governor of cadiz must it have upon the people he means the spanish people to know that a single soldier was carrying away 2580 livres tournois <\s>
<s> what an effect he might have said also must it have upon the french i direct the reader's attention to this because it seems to have been overlooked and because some of the public journals speaking of the convention and no doubt uttering the sentiments of several of their readers say that they are disgusted with the transaction not because the french have been permitted to carry off a few diamonds or some ingots of silver but because we confessed by consenting to the treaty that an army of 35,000 british troops aided by the portugueze nation was not able to compel 20,000 french to surrender at discretion <\s>
<s> this is indeed the root of the evil as hath been shewn and it is the curse of this treaty that the several parts of it are of such enormity as singly to occupy the attention and to destroy comparison and coexistence <\s>
<s> but the people of great britain are disgusted both with the one and the other <\s>
<s> they bewail the violation of the principle if the value of the things carried off had been in itself trifling their grief and their indignation would have been scarcely less <\s>
<s> but it is manifest from what has been said that it was not trifling and that therefore upon that account as well as upon others this permission was no less impolitic than it was unjust and dishonourable <\s>
<s> in illustrating these articles of the armistice and convention by which the french were both expressly permitted and indirectly enabled to carry off their booty we have already seen that a concession was made which is still more enormous viz <\s>
<s> that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or resident there and all natives of portugal who have accepted situations under the french government c shall have their property of every kind guaranteed to them by the british army <\s>
<s> by articles 16th and 17th their persons are placed under the like protection <\s>
<s> the french article xvi shall be at liberty either to accompany the french army or to remain in portugal and the portugueze article xvii shall not be rendered accountable for their political conduct during the period of the occupation of the country by the french army they all are placed under the protection of the british commanders and shall sustain no injury in their property or persons <\s>

<s> this is indeed the root of the evil as hath been shewn and it is the curse of this treaty that the several parts of it are of such enormity as singly to occupy the attention and to destroy comparison and coexistence <\s>

<s> but it is manifest from what has been said that it was not trifling and that therefore upon that account as well as upon others this permission was no less impolitic than it was unjust and dishonourable <\s>
<s> in illustrating these articles of the armistice and convention by which the french were both expressly permitted and indirectly enabled to carry off their booty we have already seen that a concession was made which is still more enormous viz <\s>
<s> that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or resident there and all natives of portugal who have accepted situations under the french government c shall have their property of every kind guaranteed to them by the british army <\s>
<s> by articles 16th and 17th their persons are placed under the like protection <\s>
<s> the french article xvi shall be at liberty either to accompany the french army or to remain in portugal and the portugueze article xvii shall not be rendered accountable for their political conduct during the period of the occupation of the country by the french army they all are placed under the protection of the british commanders and shall sustain no injury in their property or persons <\s>
<s> i have animadverted heretofore upon the unprofessional eagerness of our generals to appear in the character of negotiators when the sword would have done them more service than the pen <\s>
<s> but if they had confined themselves to mere military regulations they might indeed with justice have been grievously censured as injudicious commanders whose notion of the honour of armies was of a low pitch and who had no conception of the peculiar nature of the service in which they were engaged but the censure must have stopped here <\s>
<s> whereas by these provisions they have shewn that they have never reflected upon the nature of military authority as contra distinguished from civil <\s>
<s> french example had so far dazzled and blinded them that the french army is suffered to denominate itself the french government and from the whole tenour of these instruments from the preamble and these articles especially it should seem that our generals fancied themselves and their army to be the british government <\s>
<s> for these regulations emanating from a mere military authority are purely civil but of such a kind that no power on earth could confer a right to establish them <\s>
<s> and this trampling upon the most sacred rights this sacrifice of the consciousness of a self preserving principle without which neither societies nor governments can exist is not made by our generals in relation to subjects of their own sovereign but to an independent nation our ally into whose territories we could not have entered but from its confidence in our friendship and good faith <\s>
<s> surely the persons who under the countenance of too high authority have talked so loudly of prejudging this question entirely overlooked or utterly forgot this part of it <\s>
<s> what have these monstrous provisions to do with the relative strength of the two armies or with any point admitting a doubt <\s>
<s> what need here of a court of judicature to settle who were the persons their names are subscribed by their own hands and to determine the quality of the thing <\s>
<s> actions and agents like these exhibited in this connection with each other must of necessity be condemned the moment they are known and to assert the contrary is to maintain that man is a being without understanding and that morality is an empty dream <\s>
<s> and if this condemnation must after this manner follow to utter it is less a duty than a further inevitable consequence from the constitution of human nature <\s>
<s> they who hold that the formal sanction of a court of judicature is in this case required before a people has a right to pass sentence know not to what degree they are enemies to that people and to mankind to what degree selfishness whether arising from their peculiar situation or from other causes has in them prevailed over those faculties which are our common inheritance and cut them off from fellowship with the species <\s>
<s> most deplorable would be the result if it were possible that the injunctions of these men could be obeyed or their remonstrances acknowledged to be just <\s>
<s> for not to mention that if it were not for such prompt decisions of the public voice misdemeanours of men high in office would rarely be accounted for at all we must bear in mind at this crisis that the adversary of all good is hourly and daily extending his ravages and according to such notions of fitness our indignation our sorrow our shame our sense of right and wrong and all those moral affections and powers of the understanding by which alone he can be effectually opposed are to enter upon a long vacation their motion is to be suspended a thing impossible if it could it would be destroyed <\s>
<s> let us now see what language the portugueze speak upon that part of the treaty which has incited me to give vent to these feelings and to assert these truths <\s>
<s> i protest says general friere against article xvii one of the two now under examination because it attempts to tie down the government of this kingdom not to bring to justice and condign punishment those persons who have been notoriously and scandalously disloyal to their prince and the country by joining and serving the french party and even if the english army should be allowed to screen them from the punishment they have deserved still it should not prevent their expulsion whereby this country would no longer have to fear being again betrayed by the same men <\s>
<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>
<s> couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange <\s>
<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>
<s> which amounts to this <\s>
<s> the french are called upon formally to relinquish in favour of the portugueze that to which they never had any right to abandon false claims which they either had a power to enforce or they had not if they departed immediately and had not power the article was nugatory if they remained a day longer and had power there was no security that they would abide by it <\s>
<s> accordingly loud complaints were made that after the date of the convention all kinds of ravages were committed by the french upon lisbon and its neighbourhood and what did it matter whether these were upon the plea of old debts and requisitions or new debts were created more greedily than ever from the consciousness that the time for collecting them was so short <\s>
<s> this article then the only one which is even in shew favourable to the portugueze is in substance nothing inasmuch as in what it is silent upon viz <\s>
<s> that the people of lisbon and its neighbourhood shall not be vexed and oppressed by the french during their stay with new claims and robberies it is grossly cruel or negligent and in that for which it actually stipulates wholly delusive <\s>
<s> it is in fact insulting for the very admission of a formal renunciation of these claims does to a certain degree acknowledge their justice <\s>
<s> the only decent manner of introducing matter to this effect would have been by placing it as a bye clause of a provision that secured the portugueze from further molestations and merely alluding to it as a thing understood of course <\s>
<s> yet from the place which this specious article occupies preceding immediately the 16th and 17th which we have been last considering it is clear that it must have been intended by the french general as honey smeared upon the edge of the cup to make the poison contained in those two more palateable <\s>
<s> thus much for the portugueze and their particular interests <\s>
<s> in one instance a concern of the spanish nation comes directly under notice and that nation also is treated without delicacy or feeling <\s>
<s> for by the 18th article it is agreed that the spaniards 4000 in number who had been disarmed and were confined on ship board in the port of lisbon by the french should be liberated <\s>
<s> and upon what consideration <\s>
<s> not upon their right to be free as having been treacherously and cruelly dealt with by men who were part of a power that was labouring to subjugate their country and in this attempt had committed inhuman crimes against it not even exchanged as soldiers against soldiers but the condition of their emancipation is that the british general engages to obtain of the spaniards to restore such french subjects either military or civil as have been detained in spain without having been taken in battle or in consequence of military operations but on account of the occurrences of the 29th of last may and the days immediately following <\s>
<s> i know not what are exactly the features of the face for which this word serves as a veil i have no register at hand to inform me what these events precisely were but there can be no doubt that it was a time of triumph for liberty and humanity and that the persons for whom these noble minded spaniards were to be exchanged were no other than a horde from among the most abject of the french nation probably those wretches who having never faced either the dangers or the fatigues of war had been most busy in secret preparations or were most conspicuous in open acts of massacre when the streets of madrid a few weeks before had been drenched with the blood of two thousand of her bravest citizens <\s>
<s> yet the liberation of these spaniards upon these terms is recorded in the report of the court of enquiry as one of the advantages which in the contemplation of the generals would result from the convention <\s>
<s> finally if there shall be any doubt article xiv as to the meaning of any article it shall be explained favourably to the french army and hostages article xx of the rank of field officers on the part of the british army and navy shall be furnished for the guarantee of the present convention <\s>
<s> i have now gone through the painful task of examining the most material conditions of the convention of cintra the whole number of the articles is twenty two with three additional ones a long ladder into a deep abyss of infamy need it be said that neglects injuries and insults like these which we have been contemplating come from what quarter they may let them be exhibited towards whom they will must produce not merely mistrust and jealousy but alienation and hatred <\s>
<s> the passions and feelings may be quieted or diverted for a short time but though out of sight or seemingly asleep they must exist and the life which they have received cannot but by a long course of justice and kindness be overcome and destroyed <\s>
<s> but why talk of a long course of justice and kindness when the immediate result must have been so deplorable <\s>
<s> relying upon our humanity our fellow feeling and our justice upon these instant and urgent claims sanctioned by the more mild one of ancient alliance the portugueze people by voices from every part of their land entreated our succour the arrival of a british army upon their coasts was joyfully hailed and the people of the country zealously assisted in landing the troops without which help as a british general has informed us that landing could not have been effected <\s>
<s> and it is in this manner that they are repaid <\s>
<s> to some port between rochefort and l'orient and be at liberty to serve i come to that memorable condition article v that the french army shall carry with it all its equipments that is to say its military chests and carriages attached to the field commissariat and field hospitals or shall be allowed to dispose of such part as the commander in chief may judge it unnecessary to embark <\s>
<s> in like manner all individuals of the army shall be at liberty to dispose of their private property of every description with full security hereafter for the purchasers <\s>
<s> this is expressed still more pointedly in the armistice though the meaning implied in the two articles is precisely the same <\s>
<s> for in the fifth article of the armistice it is agreed provisionally that all those of whom the french army consists shall be conveyed to france with arms and baggage and all their private property of every description no part of which shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> in the convention it is only expressed that they shall be at liberty to depart article ii with arms and baggage and article v to dispose of their private property of every description <\s>
<s> but if they had a right to dispose of it this would include a right to carry it away which was undoubtedly understood by the french general <\s>
<s> and in the armistice it is expressly said that their private property of every description shall be conveyed to france along with their persons <\s>
<s> what then are we to understand by the words their private property of every description <\s>
<s> equipments of the army in general and baggage of individuals had been stipulated for before now we all know that the lawful professional gains and earnings of a soldier must be small that he is not in the habit of carrying about him during actual warfare any accumulation of these or other property and that the ordinary private property which he can be supposed to have a just title to is included under the name of his baggage therefore this was something more and what it was is apparent <\s>

<s> in like manner all individuals of the army shall be at liberty to dispose of their private property of every description with full security hereafter for the purchasers <\s>
<s> this is expressed still more pointedly in the armistice though the meaning implied in the two articles is precisely the same <\s>
<s> for in the fifth article of the armistice it is agreed provisionally that all those of whom the french army consists shall be conveyed to france with arms and baggage and all their private property of every description no part of which shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> in the convention it is only expressed that they shall be at liberty to depart article ii with arms and baggage and article v to dispose of their private property of every description <\s>
<s> but if they had a right to dispose of it this would include a right to carry it away which was undoubtedly understood by the french general <\s>
<s> and in the armistice it is expressly said that their private property of every description shall be conveyed to france along with their persons <\s>
<s> what then are we to understand by the words their private property of every description <\s>
<s> equipments of the army in general and baggage of individuals had been stipulated for before now we all know that the lawful professional gains and earnings of a soldier must be small that he is not in the habit of carrying about him during actual warfare any accumulation of these or other property and that the ordinary private property which he can be supposed to have a just title to is included under the name of his baggage therefore this was something more and what it was is apparent <\s>
<s> no part of their property says the armistice shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> who does not see in these words the consciousness of guilt an indirect self betraying admission that they had in their hands treasures which might be lawfully taken from them and an anxiety to prevent that act of justice by a positive stipulation <\s>
<s> who does not see on what sort of property the frenchman had his eye that it was not property by right but their possessions their plunder every thing by what means soever acquired that the french army or any individual in it was possessed of <\s>
<s> but it has been urged that the monstrousness of such a supposition precludes this interpretation renders it impossible that it could either be intended by the one party or so understood by the other <\s>
<s> what right they who signed and he who ratified this convention have to shelter themselves under this plea will appear from the 16th and 17th articles <\s>
<s> in these it is stipulated that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or accidentally in the country shall have their property of every kind moveable and immoveable guaranteed to them with liberty of retaining or disposing of it and passing the produce into france the same is stipulated article xvii for such natives of portugal as have sided with the french or occupied situations under the french government <\s>
<s> here then is a direct avowal still more monstrous that every frenchman or native of a country in alliance with france however obnoxious his crimes may have made him and every traitorous portugueze shall have his property guaranteed to him both previously to and after the reinstatement of the portugueze government by the british army <\s>
<s> now let us ask what sense the word property must have had fastened to it in these cases <\s>
<s> must it not necessarily have included all the rewards which the frenchman had received for his iniquity and the traitorous portugueze for his treason <\s>
<s> for no man would bear a part in such oppressions or would be a traitor for nothing and moreover all the rewards which the french could bestow must have been taken from the portugueze extorted from the honest and loyal to be given to the wicked and disloyal these rewards of iniquity must necessarily have been included for on our side no attempt is made at a distinction and on the side of the french the word immoveable is manifestly intended to preclude such a distinction where alone it could have been effectual <\s>
<s> property then here means possessions thus infamously acquired and in the instance of the portugueze the fundamental notion of the word is subverted for a traitor can have no property till the government of his own country has remitted the punishment due to his crimes <\s>
<s> and these wages of guilt which the master by such exactions was enabled to pay and which the servant thus earned are to be guaranteed to him by a british army <\s>
<s> where does there exist a power on earth that could confer this right <\s>
<s> if the portugueze government itself had acted in this manner it would have been guilty of wilful suicide and the nation if it had acted so of high treason against itself <\s>
<s> let it not then be said that the monstrousness of covenanting to convey along with the persons of the french their plunder secures the article from the interpretation which the people of great britain gave and which i have now proved they were bound to give to it but conceding for a moment that it was not intended that the words should bear this sense and that neither in a fair grammatical construction nor as illustrated by other passages or by the general tenour of the document they actually did bear it had not unquestionable voices proclaimed the cruelty and rapacity the acts of sacrilege assassination and robbery by which these treasures had been amassed <\s>
<s> was not the perfidy of the french army and its contempt of moral obligation both as a body and as to the individuals which composed it infamous through europe therefore the concession would signify nothing for our generals by allowing an army of this character to depart with its equipments waggons military chest and baggage had provided abundant means to enable it to carry off whatsoever it desired and thus to elude and frustrate any stipulations which might have been made for compelling it to restore that which had been so iniquitously seized <\s>
<s> and here are we brought back to the fountain head of all this baseness to that apathy and deadness to the principle of justice through the influence of which this army outlawed by its crimes was suffered to depart from the land over which it had so long tyrannized other than as a band of disarmed prisoners i maintain therefore that permission to carry off the booty was distinctly expressed and if it had not been so that the principle of justice could not here be preserved as a violation of it must necessarily have followed from other conditions of the treaty <\s>
<s> sir hew dalrymple himself before the court of inquiry has told us in two letters to generals beresford and friere that such part of the plunder as was in money it would be difficult if not impossible to identify and consequently the french could not be prevented from carrying it away with them <\s>
<s> from the same letters we learn that the french were intending to carry off a considerable part of their plunder by calling it public money and saying that it belonged to the military chest and that their evasions of the article were most shameful and evinced a want of probity and honour which was most disgraceful to them <\s>
<s> if the french had given no other proofs of their want of such virtues than those furnished by this occasion neither the portugueze nor spanish nor british nations would condemn them nor hate them as they now do; nor would this article of the convention have excited such indignation <\s>
<s> for the french by so acting could not deem themselves breaking an engagement no doubt they looked upon themselves as injured that the failure in good faith was on the part of the british and that it was in the lawlessness of power and by a mere quibble that this construction was afterwards put upon the article in question <\s>
<s> widely different from the conduct of the british was that of the spaniards in a like case with high feeling did they abating not a jot or a tittle enforce the principle of justice <\s>
<s> how says the governor of cadiz to general dupont in the same noble letter before alluded to how says he after enumerating the afflictions which his army and the tyrant who had sent it had unjustly brought upon the spanish nation for of these in their dealings with the french they never for a moment lost sight how asks he could you expect that your army should carry off from spain the fruit of its rapacity cruelty and impiety <\s>
<s> how could you conceive this possible or that we should be so stupid or senseless <\s>
<s> and this conduct is as wise in reason as it is true to nature <\s>
<s> the spanish people could have had no confidence in their government if it had not acted thus <\s>
<s> these are the sympathies which prove that a government is paternal that it makes one family with the people besides it is only by such adherence to justice that in times of like commotion popular excesses can either be mitigated or prevented <\s>
<s> if we would be efficient allies of spain nay if we would not run the risk of doing infinite harm these sentiments must not only be ours as a nation but they must pervade the hearts of our ministers and our generals our agents and our ambassadors <\s>
<s> if it be not so they who are sent abroad must either be conscious how unworthy they are and with what unworthy commissions they appear or not if they do feel this then they must hang their heads and blush for their country and themselves if they do not the spaniards must blush for them and revolt from them or what would be ten thousand times more deplorable they must purchase a reconcilement and a communion by a sacrifice of all that is excellent in themselves <\s>
<s> spain must either break down her lofty spirit her animation and fiery courage to run side by side in the same trammels with great britain or she must start off from her intended yoke fellow with contempt and aversion <\s>
<s> this is the alternative and there is no avoiding it <\s>
<s> i have yet to speak of the influence of such concessions upon the french ruler and his army <\s>
<s> with what satanic pride must he have contemplated the devotion of his servants and adherents to their law the steadiness and zeal of their perverse loyalty and the faithfulness with which they stand by him and each other <\s>
<s> how must his heart have distended with false glory while he contrasted these qualities of his subjects with the insensibility and slackness of his british enemies <\s>
<s> this notice has however no especial propriety in this place for as far as concerns bonaparte his pride and depraved confidence may be equally fed by almost all the conditions of this instrument <\s>
<s> but as to his army it is plain that the permission whether it be considered as by an express article formally granted or only involved in the general conditions of the treaty to bear away in triumph the harvest of its crimes must not only have emboldened and exalted it with arrogance and whetted its rapacity but that hereby every soldier of which this army was composed must upon his arrival in his own country have been a seed which would give back plenteously in its kind <\s>
<s> the french are at present a needy people without commerce or manufactures unsettled in their minds and debased in their morals by revolutionary practices and habits of warfare and the youth of the country are rendered desperate by oppression which leaving no choice in their occupation discharges them from all responsibility to their own consciences <\s>
<s> how powerful then must have been the action of such incitements upon a people so circumstanced <\s>
<s> the actual sight and far more the imaginary sight and handling of these treasures magnified by the romantic tales which must have been spread about them would carry into every town and village an antidote for the terrors of conscription and would rouze men like the dreams imported from the new world when the first discoverers and adventurers returned with their ingots and their gold dust their stories and their promises to inflame and madden the avarice of the old <\s>
<s> what an effect says the governor of cadiz must it have upon the people he means the spanish people to know that a single soldier was carrying away 2580 livres tournois <\s>
<s> what an effect he might have said also must it have upon the french i direct the reader's attention to this because it seems to have been overlooked and because some of the public journals speaking of the convention and no doubt uttering the sentiments of several of their readers say that they are disgusted with the transaction not because the french have been permitted to carry off a few diamonds or some ingots of silver but because we confessed by consenting to the treaty that an army of 35,000 british troops aided by the portugueze nation was not able to compel 20,000 french to surrender at discretion <\s>
<s> this is indeed the root of the evil as hath been shewn and it is the curse of this treaty that the several parts of it are of such enormity as singly to occupy the attention and to destroy comparison and coexistence <\s>
<s> but the people of great britain are disgusted both with the one and the other <\s>
<s> they bewail the violation of the principle if the value of the things carried off had been in itself trifling their grief and their indignation would have been scarcely less <\s>
<s> but it is manifest from what has been said that it was not trifling and that therefore upon that account as well as upon others this permission was no less impolitic than it was unjust and dishonourable <\s>
<s> in illustrating these articles of the armistice and convention by which the french were both expressly permitted and indirectly enabled to carry off their booty we have already seen that a concession was made which is still more enormous viz <\s>

<s> this is indeed the root of the evil as hath been shewn and it is the curse of this treaty that the several parts of it are of such enormity as singly to occupy the attention and to destroy comparison and coexistence <\s>

<s> they bewail the violation of the principle if the value of the things carried off had been in itself trifling their grief and their indignation would have been scarcely less <\s>
<s> but it is manifest from what has been said that it was not trifling and that therefore upon that account as well as upon others this permission was no less impolitic than it was unjust and dishonourable <\s>
<s> in illustrating these articles of the armistice and convention by which the french were both expressly permitted and indirectly enabled to carry off their booty we have already seen that a concession was made which is still more enormous viz <\s>
<s> that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or resident there and all natives of portugal who have accepted situations under the french government c shall have their property of every kind guaranteed to them by the british army <\s>
<s> by articles 16th and 17th their persons are placed under the like protection <\s>
<s> the french article xvi shall be at liberty either to accompany the french army or to remain in portugal and the portugueze article xvii shall not be rendered accountable for their political conduct during the period of the occupation of the country by the french army they all are placed under the protection of the british commanders and shall sustain no injury in their property or persons <\s>
<s> i have animadverted heretofore upon the unprofessional eagerness of our generals to appear in the character of negotiators when the sword would have done them more service than the pen <\s>
<s> but if they had confined themselves to mere military regulations they might indeed with justice have been grievously censured as injudicious commanders whose notion of the honour of armies was of a low pitch and who had no conception of the peculiar nature of the service in which they were engaged but the censure must have stopped here <\s>
<s> whereas by these provisions they have shewn that they have never reflected upon the nature of military authority as contra distinguished from civil <\s>
<s> french example had so far dazzled and blinded them that the french army is suffered to denominate itself the french government and from the whole tenour of these instruments from the preamble and these articles especially it should seem that our generals fancied themselves and their army to be the british government <\s>
<s> for these regulations emanating from a mere military authority are purely civil but of such a kind that no power on earth could confer a right to establish them <\s>
<s> and this trampling upon the most sacred rights this sacrifice of the consciousness of a self preserving principle without which neither societies nor governments can exist is not made by our generals in relation to subjects of their own sovereign but to an independent nation our ally into whose territories we could not have entered but from its confidence in our friendship and good faith <\s>
<s> surely the persons who under the countenance of too high authority have talked so loudly of prejudging this question entirely overlooked or utterly forgot this part of it <\s>
<s> what have these monstrous provisions to do with the relative strength of the two armies or with any point admitting a doubt <\s>
<s> what need here of a court of judicature to settle who were the persons their names are subscribed by their own hands and to determine the quality of the thing <\s>
<s> actions and agents like these exhibited in this connection with each other must of necessity be condemned the moment they are known and to assert the contrary is to maintain that man is a being without understanding and that morality is an empty dream <\s>
<s> and if this condemnation must after this manner follow to utter it is less a duty than a further inevitable consequence from the constitution of human nature <\s>
<s> they who hold that the formal sanction of a court of judicature is in this case required before a people has a right to pass sentence know not to what degree they are enemies to that people and to mankind to what degree selfishness whether arising from their peculiar situation or from other causes has in them prevailed over those faculties which are our common inheritance and cut them off from fellowship with the species <\s>
<s> most deplorable would be the result if it were possible that the injunctions of these men could be obeyed or their remonstrances acknowledged to be just <\s>
<s> for not to mention that if it were not for such prompt decisions of the public voice misdemeanours of men high in office would rarely be accounted for at all we must bear in mind at this crisis that the adversary of all good is hourly and daily extending his ravages and according to such notions of fitness our indignation our sorrow our shame our sense of right and wrong and all those moral affections and powers of the understanding by which alone he can be effectually opposed are to enter upon a long vacation their motion is to be suspended a thing impossible if it could it would be destroyed <\s>
<s> let us now see what language the portugueze speak upon that part of the treaty which has incited me to give vent to these feelings and to assert these truths <\s>
<s> i protest says general friere against article xvii one of the two now under examination because it attempts to tie down the government of this kingdom not to bring to justice and condign punishment those persons who have been notoriously and scandalously disloyal to their prince and the country by joining and serving the french party and even if the english army should be allowed to screen them from the punishment they have deserved still it should not prevent their expulsion whereby this country would no longer have to fear being again betrayed by the same men <\s>
<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>
<s> couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange <\s>
<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>
<s> which amounts to this <\s>
<s> the french are called upon formally to relinquish in favour of the portugueze that to which they never had any right to abandon false claims which they either had a power to enforce or they had not if they departed immediately and had not power the article was nugatory if they remained a day longer and had power there was no security that they would abide by it <\s>
<s> accordingly loud complaints were made that after the date of the convention all kinds of ravages were committed by the french upon lisbon and its neighbourhood and what did it matter whether these were upon the plea of old debts and requisitions or new debts were created more greedily than ever from the consciousness that the time for collecting them was so short <\s>
<s> this article then the only one which is even in shew favourable to the portugueze is in substance nothing inasmuch as in what it is silent upon viz <\s>
<s> that the people of lisbon and its neighbourhood shall not be vexed and oppressed by the french during their stay with new claims and robberies it is grossly cruel or negligent and in that for which it actually stipulates wholly delusive <\s>
<s> it is in fact insulting for the very admission of a formal renunciation of these claims does to a certain degree acknowledge their justice <\s>
<s> the only decent manner of introducing matter to this effect would have been by placing it as a bye clause of a provision that secured the portugueze from further molestations and merely alluding to it as a thing understood of course <\s>
<s> yet from the place which this specious article occupies preceding immediately the 16th and 17th which we have been last considering it is clear that it must have been intended by the french general as honey smeared upon the edge of the cup to make the poison contained in those two more palateable <\s>
<s> thus much for the portugueze and their particular interests <\s>
<s> in one instance a concern of the spanish nation comes directly under notice and that nation also is treated without delicacy or feeling <\s>
<s> for by the 18th article it is agreed that the spaniards 4000 in number who had been disarmed and were confined on ship board in the port of lisbon by the french should be liberated <\s>
<s> and upon what consideration <\s>
<s> not upon their right to be free as having been treacherously and cruelly dealt with by men who were part of a power that was labouring to subjugate their country and in this attempt had committed inhuman crimes against it not even exchanged as soldiers against soldiers but the condition of their emancipation is that the british general engages to obtain of the spaniards to restore such french subjects either military or civil as have been detained in spain without having been taken in battle or in consequence of military operations but on account of the occurrences of the 29th of last may and the days immediately following <\s>
<s> i know not what are exactly the features of the face for which this word serves as a veil i have no register at hand to inform me what these events precisely were but there can be no doubt that it was a time of triumph for liberty and humanity and that the persons for whom these noble minded spaniards were to be exchanged were no other than a horde from among the most abject of the french nation probably those wretches who having never faced either the dangers or the fatigues of war had been most busy in secret preparations or were most conspicuous in open acts of massacre when the streets of madrid a few weeks before had been drenched with the blood of two thousand of her bravest citizens <\s>
<s> yet the liberation of these spaniards upon these terms is recorded in the report of the court of enquiry as one of the advantages which in the contemplation of the generals would result from the convention <\s>
<s> finally if there shall be any doubt article xiv as to the meaning of any article it shall be explained favourably to the french army and hostages article xx of the rank of field officers on the part of the british army and navy shall be furnished for the guarantee of the present convention <\s>
<s> i have now gone through the painful task of examining the most material conditions of the convention of cintra the whole number of the articles is twenty two with three additional ones a long ladder into a deep abyss of infamy need it be said that neglects injuries and insults like these which we have been contemplating come from what quarter they may let them be exhibited towards whom they will must produce not merely mistrust and jealousy but alienation and hatred <\s>
<s> the passions and feelings may be quieted or diverted for a short time but though out of sight or seemingly asleep they must exist and the life which they have received cannot but by a long course of justice and kindness be overcome and destroyed <\s>
<s> but why talk of a long course of justice and kindness when the immediate result must have been so deplorable <\s>
<s> relying upon our humanity our fellow feeling and our justice upon these instant and urgent claims sanctioned by the more mild one of ancient alliance the portugueze people by voices from every part of their land entreated our succour the arrival of a british army upon their coasts was joyfully hailed and the people of the country zealously assisted in landing the troops without which help as a british general has informed us that landing could not have been effected <\s>
<s> and it is in this manner that they are repaid <\s>
<s> to some port between rochefort and l'orient and be at liberty to serve i come to that memorable condition article v that the french army shall carry with it all its equipments that is to say its military chests and carriages attached to the field commissariat and field hospitals or shall be allowed to dispose of such part as the commander in chief may judge it unnecessary to embark <\s>
<s> in like manner all individuals of the army shall be at liberty to dispose of their private property of every description with full security hereafter for the purchasers <\s>

<s> relying upon our humanity our fellow feeling and our justice upon these instant and urgent claims sanctioned by the more mild one of ancient alliance the portugueze people by voices from every part of their land entreated our succour the arrival of a british army upon their coasts was joyfully hailed and the people of the country zealously assisted in landing the troops without which help as a british general has informed us that landing could not have been effected <\s>

<s> in like manner all individuals of the army shall be at liberty to dispose of their private property of every description with full security hereafter for the purchasers <\s>
<s> this is expressed still more pointedly in the armistice though the meaning implied in the two articles is precisely the same <\s>
<s> for in the fifth article of the armistice it is agreed provisionally that all those of whom the french army consists shall be conveyed to france with arms and baggage and all their private property of every description no part of which shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> in the convention it is only expressed that they shall be at liberty to depart article ii with arms and baggage and article v to dispose of their private property of every description <\s>
<s> but if they had a right to dispose of it this would include a right to carry it away which was undoubtedly understood by the french general <\s>
<s> and in the armistice it is expressly said that their private property of every description shall be conveyed to france along with their persons <\s>
<s> what then are we to understand by the words their private property of every description <\s>
<s> equipments of the army in general and baggage of individuals had been stipulated for before now we all know that the lawful professional gains and earnings of a soldier must be small that he is not in the habit of carrying about him during actual warfare any accumulation of these or other property and that the ordinary private property which he can be supposed to have a just title to is included under the name of his baggage therefore this was something more and what it was is apparent <\s>
<s> no part of their property says the armistice shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> who does not see in these words the consciousness of guilt an indirect self betraying admission that they had in their hands treasures which might be lawfully taken from them and an anxiety to prevent that act of justice by a positive stipulation <\s>
<s> who does not see on what sort of property the frenchman had his eye that it was not property by right but their possessions their plunder every thing by what means soever acquired that the french army or any individual in it was possessed of <\s>
<s> but it has been urged that the monstrousness of such a supposition precludes this interpretation renders it impossible that it could either be intended by the one party or so understood by the other <\s>
<s> what right they who signed and he who ratified this convention have to shelter themselves under this plea will appear from the 16th and 17th articles <\s>
<s> in these it is stipulated that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or accidentally in the country shall have their property of every kind moveable and immoveable guaranteed to them with liberty of retaining or disposing of it and passing the produce into france the same is stipulated article xvii for such natives of portugal as have sided with the french or occupied situations under the french government <\s>
<s> here then is a direct avowal still more monstrous that every frenchman or native of a country in alliance with france however obnoxious his crimes may have made him and every traitorous portugueze shall have his property guaranteed to him both previously to and after the reinstatement of the portugueze government by the british army <\s>
<s> now let us ask what sense the word property must have had fastened to it in these cases <\s>
<s> must it not necessarily have included all the rewards which the frenchman had received for his iniquity and the traitorous portugueze for his treason <\s>
<s> for no man would bear a part in such oppressions or would be a traitor for nothing and moreover all the rewards which the french could bestow must have been taken from the portugueze extorted from the honest and loyal to be given to the wicked and disloyal these rewards of iniquity must necessarily have been included for on our side no attempt is made at a distinction and on the side of the french the word immoveable is manifestly intended to preclude such a distinction where alone it could have been effectual <\s>
<s> property then here means possessions thus infamously acquired and in the instance of the portugueze the fundamental notion of the word is subverted for a traitor can have no property till the government of his own country has remitted the punishment due to his crimes <\s>
<s> and these wages of guilt which the master by such exactions was enabled to pay and which the servant thus earned are to be guaranteed to him by a british army <\s>
<s> where does there exist a power on earth that could confer this right <\s>
<s> if the portugueze government itself had acted in this manner it would have been guilty of wilful suicide and the nation if it had acted so of high treason against itself <\s>
<s> let it not then be said that the monstrousness of covenanting to convey along with the persons of the french their plunder secures the article from the interpretation which the people of great britain gave and which i have now proved they were bound to give to it but conceding for a moment that it was not intended that the words should bear this sense and that neither in a fair grammatical construction nor as illustrated by other passages or by the general tenour of the document they actually did bear it had not unquestionable voices proclaimed the cruelty and rapacity the acts of sacrilege assassination and robbery by which these treasures had been amassed <\s>
<s> was not the perfidy of the french army and its contempt of moral obligation both as a body and as to the individuals which composed it infamous through europe therefore the concession would signify nothing for our generals by allowing an army of this character to depart with its equipments waggons military chest and baggage had provided abundant means to enable it to carry off whatsoever it desired and thus to elude and frustrate any stipulations which might have been made for compelling it to restore that which had been so iniquitously seized <\s>
<s> and here are we brought back to the fountain head of all this baseness to that apathy and deadness to the principle of justice through the influence of which this army outlawed by its crimes was suffered to depart from the land over which it had so long tyrannized other than as a band of disarmed prisoners i maintain therefore that permission to carry off the booty was distinctly expressed and if it had not been so that the principle of justice could not here be preserved as a violation of it must necessarily have followed from other conditions of the treaty <\s>
<s> sir hew dalrymple himself before the court of inquiry has told us in two letters to generals beresford and friere that such part of the plunder as was in money it would be difficult if not impossible to identify and consequently the french could not be prevented from carrying it away with them <\s>
<s> from the same letters we learn that the french were intending to carry off a considerable part of their plunder by calling it public money and saying that it belonged to the military chest and that their evasions of the article were most shameful and evinced a want of probity and honour which was most disgraceful to them <\s>
<s> if the french had given no other proofs of their want of such virtues than those furnished by this occasion neither the portugueze nor spanish nor british nations would condemn them nor hate them as they now do; nor would this article of the convention have excited such indignation <\s>
<s> for the french by so acting could not deem themselves breaking an engagement no doubt they looked upon themselves as injured that the failure in good faith was on the part of the british and that it was in the lawlessness of power and by a mere quibble that this construction was afterwards put upon the article in question <\s>
<s> widely different from the conduct of the british was that of the spaniards in a like case with high feeling did they abating not a jot or a tittle enforce the principle of justice <\s>
<s> how says the governor of cadiz to general dupont in the same noble letter before alluded to how says he after enumerating the afflictions which his army and the tyrant who had sent it had unjustly brought upon the spanish nation for of these in their dealings with the french they never for a moment lost sight how asks he could you expect that your army should carry off from spain the fruit of its rapacity cruelty and impiety <\s>
<s> how could you conceive this possible or that we should be so stupid or senseless <\s>
<s> and this conduct is as wise in reason as it is true to nature <\s>
<s> the spanish people could have had no confidence in their government if it had not acted thus <\s>
<s> these are the sympathies which prove that a government is paternal that it makes one family with the people besides it is only by such adherence to justice that in times of like commotion popular excesses can either be mitigated or prevented <\s>
<s> if we would be efficient allies of spain nay if we would not run the risk of doing infinite harm these sentiments must not only be ours as a nation but they must pervade the hearts of our ministers and our generals our agents and our ambassadors <\s>
<s> if it be not so they who are sent abroad must either be conscious how unworthy they are and with what unworthy commissions they appear or not if they do feel this then they must hang their heads and blush for their country and themselves if they do not the spaniards must blush for them and revolt from them or what would be ten thousand times more deplorable they must purchase a reconcilement and a communion by a sacrifice of all that is excellent in themselves <\s>
<s> spain must either break down her lofty spirit her animation and fiery courage to run side by side in the same trammels with great britain or she must start off from her intended yoke fellow with contempt and aversion <\s>
<s> this is the alternative and there is no avoiding it <\s>
<s> i have yet to speak of the influence of such concessions upon the french ruler and his army <\s>
<s> with what satanic pride must he have contemplated the devotion of his servants and adherents to their law the steadiness and zeal of their perverse loyalty and the faithfulness with which they stand by him and each other <\s>
<s> how must his heart have distended with false glory while he contrasted these qualities of his subjects with the insensibility and slackness of his british enemies <\s>
<s> this notice has however no especial propriety in this place for as far as concerns bonaparte his pride and depraved confidence may be equally fed by almost all the conditions of this instrument <\s>
<s> but as to his army it is plain that the permission whether it be considered as by an express article formally granted or only involved in the general conditions of the treaty to bear away in triumph the harvest of its crimes must not only have emboldened and exalted it with arrogance and whetted its rapacity but that hereby every soldier of which this army was composed must upon his arrival in his own country have been a seed which would give back plenteously in its kind <\s>
<s> the french are at present a needy people without commerce or manufactures unsettled in their minds and debased in their morals by revolutionary practices and habits of warfare and the youth of the country are rendered desperate by oppression which leaving no choice in their occupation discharges them from all responsibility to their own consciences <\s>
<s> how powerful then must have been the action of such incitements upon a people so circumstanced <\s>
<s> the actual sight and far more the imaginary sight and handling of these treasures magnified by the romantic tales which must have been spread about them would carry into every town and village an antidote for the terrors of conscription and would rouze men like the dreams imported from the new world when the first discoverers and adventurers returned with their ingots and their gold dust their stories and their promises to inflame and madden the avarice of the old <\s>
<s> what an effect says the governor of cadiz must it have upon the people he means the spanish people to know that a single soldier was carrying away 2580 livres tournois <\s>
<s> what an effect he might have said also must it have upon the french i direct the reader's attention to this because it seems to have been overlooked and because some of the public journals speaking of the convention and no doubt uttering the sentiments of several of their readers say that they are disgusted with the transaction not because the french have been permitted to carry off a few diamonds or some ingots of silver but because we confessed by consenting to the treaty that an army of 35,000 british troops aided by the portugueze nation was not able to compel 20,000 french to surrender at discretion <\s>
<s> this is indeed the root of the evil as hath been shewn and it is the curse of this treaty that the several parts of it are of such enormity as singly to occupy the attention and to destroy comparison and coexistence <\s>
<s> but the people of great britain are disgusted both with the one and the other <\s>
<s> they bewail the violation of the principle if the value of the things carried off had been in itself trifling their grief and their indignation would have been scarcely less <\s>

<s> what an effect says the governor of cadiz must it have upon the people he means the spanish people to know that a single soldier was carrying away 2580 livres tournois <\s>
<s> what an effect he might have said also must it have upon the french i direct the reader's attention to this because it seems to have been overlooked and because some of the public journals speaking of the convention and no doubt uttering the sentiments of several of their readers say that they are disgusted with the transaction not because the french have been permitted to carry off a few diamonds or some ingots of silver but because we confessed by consenting to the treaty that an army of 35,000 british troops aided by the portugueze nation was not able to compel 20,000 french to surrender at discretion <\s>
<s> this is indeed the root of the evil as hath been shewn and it is the curse of this treaty that the several parts of it are of such enormity as singly to occupy the attention and to destroy comparison and coexistence <\s>
<s> but the people of great britain are disgusted both with the one and the other <\s>
<s> they bewail the violation of the principle if the value of the things carried off had been in itself trifling their grief and their indignation would have been scarcely less <\s>
<s> but it is manifest from what has been said that it was not trifling and that therefore upon that account as well as upon others this permission was no less impolitic than it was unjust and dishonourable <\s>
<s> in illustrating these articles of the armistice and convention by which the french were both expressly permitted and indirectly enabled to carry off their booty we have already seen that a concession was made which is still more enormous viz <\s>
<s> that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or resident there and all natives of portugal who have accepted situations under the french government c shall have their property of every kind guaranteed to them by the british army <\s>
<s> by articles 16th and 17th their persons are placed under the like protection <\s>
<s> the french article xvi shall be at liberty either to accompany the french army or to remain in portugal and the portugueze article xvii shall not be rendered accountable for their political conduct during the period of the occupation of the country by the french army they all are placed under the protection of the british commanders and shall sustain no injury in their property or persons <\s>
<s> i have animadverted heretofore upon the unprofessional eagerness of our generals to appear in the character of negotiators when the sword would have done them more service than the pen <\s>
<s> but if they had confined themselves to mere military regulations they might indeed with justice have been grievously censured as injudicious commanders whose notion of the honour of armies was of a low pitch and who had no conception of the peculiar nature of the service in which they were engaged but the censure must have stopped here <\s>
<s> whereas by these provisions they have shewn that they have never reflected upon the nature of military authority as contra distinguished from civil <\s>
<s> french example had so far dazzled and blinded them that the french army is suffered to denominate itself the french government and from the whole tenour of these instruments from the preamble and these articles especially it should seem that our generals fancied themselves and their army to be the british government <\s>
<s> for these regulations emanating from a mere military authority are purely civil but of such a kind that no power on earth could confer a right to establish them <\s>
<s> and this trampling upon the most sacred rights this sacrifice of the consciousness of a self preserving principle without which neither societies nor governments can exist is not made by our generals in relation to subjects of their own sovereign but to an independent nation our ally into whose territories we could not have entered but from its confidence in our friendship and good faith <\s>
<s> surely the persons who under the countenance of too high authority have talked so loudly of prejudging this question entirely overlooked or utterly forgot this part of it <\s>
<s> what have these monstrous provisions to do with the relative strength of the two armies or with any point admitting a doubt <\s>
<s> what need here of a court of judicature to settle who were the persons their names are subscribed by their own hands and to determine the quality of the thing <\s>
<s> actions and agents like these exhibited in this connection with each other must of necessity be condemned the moment they are known and to assert the contrary is to maintain that man is a being without understanding and that morality is an empty dream <\s>
<s> and if this condemnation must after this manner follow to utter it is less a duty than a further inevitable consequence from the constitution of human nature <\s>
<s> they who hold that the formal sanction of a court of judicature is in this case required before a people has a right to pass sentence know not to what degree they are enemies to that people and to mankind to what degree selfishness whether arising from their peculiar situation or from other causes has in them prevailed over those faculties which are our common inheritance and cut them off from fellowship with the species <\s>
<s> most deplorable would be the result if it were possible that the injunctions of these men could be obeyed or their remonstrances acknowledged to be just <\s>
<s> for not to mention that if it were not for such prompt decisions of the public voice misdemeanours of men high in office would rarely be accounted for at all we must bear in mind at this crisis that the adversary of all good is hourly and daily extending his ravages and according to such notions of fitness our indignation our sorrow our shame our sense of right and wrong and all those moral affections and powers of the understanding by which alone he can be effectually opposed are to enter upon a long vacation their motion is to be suspended a thing impossible if it could it would be destroyed <\s>
<s> let us now see what language the portugueze speak upon that part of the treaty which has incited me to give vent to these feelings and to assert these truths <\s>
<s> i protest says general friere against article xvii one of the two now under examination because it attempts to tie down the government of this kingdom not to bring to justice and condign punishment those persons who have been notoriously and scandalously disloyal to their prince and the country by joining and serving the french party and even if the english army should be allowed to screen them from the punishment they have deserved still it should not prevent their expulsion whereby this country would no longer have to fear being again betrayed by the same men <\s>
<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>
<s> couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange <\s>
<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>
<s> which amounts to this <\s>
<s> the french are called upon formally to relinquish in favour of the portugueze that to which they never had any right to abandon false claims which they either had a power to enforce or they had not if they departed immediately and had not power the article was nugatory if they remained a day longer and had power there was no security that they would abide by it <\s>
<s> accordingly loud complaints were made that after the date of the convention all kinds of ravages were committed by the french upon lisbon and its neighbourhood and what did it matter whether these were upon the plea of old debts and requisitions or new debts were created more greedily than ever from the consciousness that the time for collecting them was so short <\s>
<s> this article then the only one which is even in shew favourable to the portugueze is in substance nothing inasmuch as in what it is silent upon viz <\s>
<s> that the people of lisbon and its neighbourhood shall not be vexed and oppressed by the french during their stay with new claims and robberies it is grossly cruel or negligent and in that for which it actually stipulates wholly delusive <\s>
<s> it is in fact insulting for the very admission of a formal renunciation of these claims does to a certain degree acknowledge their justice <\s>
<s> the only decent manner of introducing matter to this effect would have been by placing it as a bye clause of a provision that secured the portugueze from further molestations and merely alluding to it as a thing understood of course <\s>
<s> yet from the place which this specious article occupies preceding immediately the 16th and 17th which we have been last considering it is clear that it must have been intended by the french general as honey smeared upon the edge of the cup to make the poison contained in those two more palateable <\s>
<s> thus much for the portugueze and their particular interests <\s>
<s> in one instance a concern of the spanish nation comes directly under notice and that nation also is treated without delicacy or feeling <\s>
<s> for by the 18th article it is agreed that the spaniards 4000 in number who had been disarmed and were confined on ship board in the port of lisbon by the french should be liberated <\s>
<s> and upon what consideration <\s>
<s> not upon their right to be free as having been treacherously and cruelly dealt with by men who were part of a power that was labouring to subjugate their country and in this attempt had committed inhuman crimes against it not even exchanged as soldiers against soldiers but the condition of their emancipation is that the british general engages to obtain of the spaniards to restore such french subjects either military or civil as have been detained in spain without having been taken in battle or in consequence of military operations but on account of the occurrences of the 29th of last may and the days immediately following <\s>
<s> i know not what are exactly the features of the face for which this word serves as a veil i have no register at hand to inform me what these events precisely were but there can be no doubt that it was a time of triumph for liberty and humanity and that the persons for whom these noble minded spaniards were to be exchanged were no other than a horde from among the most abject of the french nation probably those wretches who having never faced either the dangers or the fatigues of war had been most busy in secret preparations or were most conspicuous in open acts of massacre when the streets of madrid a few weeks before had been drenched with the blood of two thousand of her bravest citizens <\s>
<s> yet the liberation of these spaniards upon these terms is recorded in the report of the court of enquiry as one of the advantages which in the contemplation of the generals would result from the convention <\s>
<s> finally if there shall be any doubt article xiv as to the meaning of any article it shall be explained favourably to the french army and hostages article xx of the rank of field officers on the part of the british army and navy shall be furnished for the guarantee of the present convention <\s>
<s> i have now gone through the painful task of examining the most material conditions of the convention of cintra the whole number of the articles is twenty two with three additional ones a long ladder into a deep abyss of infamy need it be said that neglects injuries and insults like these which we have been contemplating come from what quarter they may let them be exhibited towards whom they will must produce not merely mistrust and jealousy but alienation and hatred <\s>
<s> the passions and feelings may be quieted or diverted for a short time but though out of sight or seemingly asleep they must exist and the life which they have received cannot but by a long course of justice and kindness be overcome and destroyed <\s>
<s> but why talk of a long course of justice and kindness when the immediate result must have been so deplorable <\s>
<s> relying upon our humanity our fellow feeling and our justice upon these instant and urgent claims sanctioned by the more mild one of ancient alliance the portugueze people by voices from every part of their land entreated our succour the arrival of a british army upon their coasts was joyfully hailed and the people of the country zealously assisted in landing the troops without which help as a british general has informed us that landing could not have been effected <\s>
<s> and it is in this manner that they are repaid <\s>
<s> to some port between rochefort and l'orient and be at liberty to serve i come to that memorable condition article v that the french army shall carry with it all its equipments that is to say its military chests and carriages attached to the field commissariat and field hospitals or shall be allowed to dispose of such part as the commander in chief may judge it unnecessary to embark <\s>

<s> i have now gone through the painful task of examining the most material conditions of the convention of cintra the whole number of the articles is twenty two with three additional ones a long ladder into a deep abyss of infamy need it be said that neglects injuries and insults like these which we have been contemplating come from what quarter they may let them be exhibited towards whom they will must produce not merely mistrust and jealousy but alienation and hatred <\s>
<s> the passions and feelings may be quieted or diverted for a short time but though out of sight or seemingly asleep they must exist and the life which they have received cannot but by a long course of justice and kindness be overcome and destroyed <\s>
<s> but why talk of a long course of justice and kindness when the immediate result must have been so deplorable <\s>
<s> relying upon our humanity our fellow feeling and our justice upon these instant and urgent claims sanctioned by the more mild one of ancient alliance the portugueze people by voices from every part of their land entreated our succour the arrival of a british army upon their coasts was joyfully hailed and the people of the country zealously assisted in landing the troops without which help as a british general has informed us that landing could not have been effected <\s>
<s> and it is in this manner that they are repaid <\s>
<s> to some port between rochefort and l'orient and be at liberty to serve i come to that memorable condition article v that the french army shall carry with it all its equipments that is to say its military chests and carriages attached to the field commissariat and field hospitals or shall be allowed to dispose of such part as the commander in chief may judge it unnecessary to embark <\s>
<s> in like manner all individuals of the army shall be at liberty to dispose of their private property of every description with full security hereafter for the purchasers <\s>
<s> this is expressed still more pointedly in the armistice though the meaning implied in the two articles is precisely the same <\s>
<s> for in the fifth article of the armistice it is agreed provisionally that all those of whom the french army consists shall be conveyed to france with arms and baggage and all their private property of every description no part of which shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> in the convention it is only expressed that they shall be at liberty to depart article ii with arms and baggage and article v to dispose of their private property of every description <\s>
<s> but if they had a right to dispose of it this would include a right to carry it away which was undoubtedly understood by the french general <\s>
<s> and in the armistice it is expressly said that their private property of every description shall be conveyed to france along with their persons <\s>
<s> what then are we to understand by the words their private property of every description <\s>
<s> equipments of the army in general and baggage of individuals had been stipulated for before now we all know that the lawful professional gains and earnings of a soldier must be small that he is not in the habit of carrying about him during actual warfare any accumulation of these or other property and that the ordinary private property which he can be supposed to have a just title to is included under the name of his baggage therefore this was something more and what it was is apparent <\s>
<s> no part of their property says the armistice shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> who does not see in these words the consciousness of guilt an indirect self betraying admission that they had in their hands treasures which might be lawfully taken from them and an anxiety to prevent that act of justice by a positive stipulation <\s>
<s> who does not see on what sort of property the frenchman had his eye that it was not property by right but their possessions their plunder every thing by what means soever acquired that the french army or any individual in it was possessed of <\s>
<s> but it has been urged that the monstrousness of such a supposition precludes this interpretation renders it impossible that it could either be intended by the one party or so understood by the other <\s>
<s> what right they who signed and he who ratified this convention have to shelter themselves under this plea will appear from the 16th and 17th articles <\s>
<s> in these it is stipulated that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or accidentally in the country shall have their property of every kind moveable and immoveable guaranteed to them with liberty of retaining or disposing of it and passing the produce into france the same is stipulated article xvii for such natives of portugal as have sided with the french or occupied situations under the french government <\s>
<s> here then is a direct avowal still more monstrous that every frenchman or native of a country in alliance with france however obnoxious his crimes may have made him and every traitorous portugueze shall have his property guaranteed to him both previously to and after the reinstatement of the portugueze government by the british army <\s>
<s> now let us ask what sense the word property must have had fastened to it in these cases <\s>
<s> must it not necessarily have included all the rewards which the frenchman had received for his iniquity and the traitorous portugueze for his treason <\s>
<s> for no man would bear a part in such oppressions or would be a traitor for nothing and moreover all the rewards which the french could bestow must have been taken from the portugueze extorted from the honest and loyal to be given to the wicked and disloyal these rewards of iniquity must necessarily have been included for on our side no attempt is made at a distinction and on the side of the french the word immoveable is manifestly intended to preclude such a distinction where alone it could have been effectual <\s>
<s> property then here means possessions thus infamously acquired and in the instance of the portugueze the fundamental notion of the word is subverted for a traitor can have no property till the government of his own country has remitted the punishment due to his crimes <\s>
<s> and these wages of guilt which the master by such exactions was enabled to pay and which the servant thus earned are to be guaranteed to him by a british army <\s>
<s> where does there exist a power on earth that could confer this right <\s>
<s> if the portugueze government itself had acted in this manner it would have been guilty of wilful suicide and the nation if it had acted so of high treason against itself <\s>
<s> let it not then be said that the monstrousness of covenanting to convey along with the persons of the french their plunder secures the article from the interpretation which the people of great britain gave and which i have now proved they were bound to give to it but conceding for a moment that it was not intended that the words should bear this sense and that neither in a fair grammatical construction nor as illustrated by other passages or by the general tenour of the document they actually did bear it had not unquestionable voices proclaimed the cruelty and rapacity the acts of sacrilege assassination and robbery by which these treasures had been amassed <\s>
<s> was not the perfidy of the french army and its contempt of moral obligation both as a body and as to the individuals which composed it infamous through europe therefore the concession would signify nothing for our generals by allowing an army of this character to depart with its equipments waggons military chest and baggage had provided abundant means to enable it to carry off whatsoever it desired and thus to elude and frustrate any stipulations which might have been made for compelling it to restore that which had been so iniquitously seized <\s>
<s> and here are we brought back to the fountain head of all this baseness to that apathy and deadness to the principle of justice through the influence of which this army outlawed by its crimes was suffered to depart from the land over which it had so long tyrannized other than as a band of disarmed prisoners i maintain therefore that permission to carry off the booty was distinctly expressed and if it had not been so that the principle of justice could not here be preserved as a violation of it must necessarily have followed from other conditions of the treaty <\s>
<s> sir hew dalrymple himself before the court of inquiry has told us in two letters to generals beresford and friere that such part of the plunder as was in money it would be difficult if not impossible to identify and consequently the french could not be prevented from carrying it away with them <\s>
<s> from the same letters we learn that the french were intending to carry off a considerable part of their plunder by calling it public money and saying that it belonged to the military chest and that their evasions of the article were most shameful and evinced a want of probity and honour which was most disgraceful to them <\s>
<s> if the french had given no other proofs of their want of such virtues than those furnished by this occasion neither the portugueze nor spanish nor british nations would condemn them nor hate them as they now do; nor would this article of the convention have excited such indignation <\s>
<s> for the french by so acting could not deem themselves breaking an engagement no doubt they looked upon themselves as injured that the failure in good faith was on the part of the british and that it was in the lawlessness of power and by a mere quibble that this construction was afterwards put upon the article in question <\s>
<s> widely different from the conduct of the british was that of the spaniards in a like case with high feeling did they abating not a jot or a tittle enforce the principle of justice <\s>
<s> how says the governor of cadiz to general dupont in the same noble letter before alluded to how says he after enumerating the afflictions which his army and the tyrant who had sent it had unjustly brought upon the spanish nation for of these in their dealings with the french they never for a moment lost sight how asks he could you expect that your army should carry off from spain the fruit of its rapacity cruelty and impiety <\s>
<s> how could you conceive this possible or that we should be so stupid or senseless <\s>
<s> and this conduct is as wise in reason as it is true to nature <\s>
<s> the spanish people could have had no confidence in their government if it had not acted thus <\s>
<s> these are the sympathies which prove that a government is paternal that it makes one family with the people besides it is only by such adherence to justice that in times of like commotion popular excesses can either be mitigated or prevented <\s>
<s> if we would be efficient allies of spain nay if we would not run the risk of doing infinite harm these sentiments must not only be ours as a nation but they must pervade the hearts of our ministers and our generals our agents and our ambassadors <\s>
<s> if it be not so they who are sent abroad must either be conscious how unworthy they are and with what unworthy commissions they appear or not if they do feel this then they must hang their heads and blush for their country and themselves if they do not the spaniards must blush for them and revolt from them or what would be ten thousand times more deplorable they must purchase a reconcilement and a communion by a sacrifice of all that is excellent in themselves <\s>
<s> spain must either break down her lofty spirit her animation and fiery courage to run side by side in the same trammels with great britain or she must start off from her intended yoke fellow with contempt and aversion <\s>
<s> this is the alternative and there is no avoiding it <\s>
<s> i have yet to speak of the influence of such concessions upon the french ruler and his army <\s>
<s> with what satanic pride must he have contemplated the devotion of his servants and adherents to their law the steadiness and zeal of their perverse loyalty and the faithfulness with which they stand by him and each other <\s>
<s> how must his heart have distended with false glory while he contrasted these qualities of his subjects with the insensibility and slackness of his british enemies <\s>
<s> this notice has however no especial propriety in this place for as far as concerns bonaparte his pride and depraved confidence may be equally fed by almost all the conditions of this instrument <\s>
<s> but as to his army it is plain that the permission whether it be considered as by an express article formally granted or only involved in the general conditions of the treaty to bear away in triumph the harvest of its crimes must not only have emboldened and exalted it with arrogance and whetted its rapacity but that hereby every soldier of which this army was composed must upon his arrival in his own country have been a seed which would give back plenteously in its kind <\s>
<s> the french are at present a needy people without commerce or manufactures unsettled in their minds and debased in their morals by revolutionary practices and habits of warfare and the youth of the country are rendered desperate by oppression which leaving no choice in their occupation discharges them from all responsibility to their own consciences <\s>
<s> how powerful then must have been the action of such incitements upon a people so circumstanced <\s>
<s> the actual sight and far more the imaginary sight and handling of these treasures magnified by the romantic tales which must have been spread about them would carry into every town and village an antidote for the terrors of conscription and would rouze men like the dreams imported from the new world when the first discoverers and adventurers returned with their ingots and their gold dust their stories and their promises to inflame and madden the avarice of the old <\s>

<s> this notice has however no especial propriety in this place for as far as concerns bonaparte his pride and depraved confidence may be equally fed by almost all the conditions of this instrument <\s>
<s> but as to his army it is plain that the permission whether it be considered as by an express article formally granted or only involved in the general conditions of the treaty to bear away in triumph the harvest of its crimes must not only have emboldened and exalted it with arrogance and whetted its rapacity but that hereby every soldier of which this army was composed must upon his arrival in his own country have been a seed which would give back plenteously in its kind <\s>
<s> the french are at present a needy people without commerce or manufactures unsettled in their minds and debased in their morals by revolutionary practices and habits of warfare and the youth of the country are rendered desperate by oppression which leaving no choice in their occupation discharges them from all responsibility to their own consciences <\s>
<s> how powerful then must have been the action of such incitements upon a people so circumstanced <\s>
<s> the actual sight and far more the imaginary sight and handling of these treasures magnified by the romantic tales which must have been spread about them would carry into every town and village an antidote for the terrors of conscription and would rouze men like the dreams imported from the new world when the first discoverers and adventurers returned with their ingots and their gold dust their stories and their promises to inflame and madden the avarice of the old <\s>
<s> what an effect says the governor of cadiz must it have upon the people he means the spanish people to know that a single soldier was carrying away 2580 livres tournois <\s>
<s> what an effect he might have said also must it have upon the french i direct the reader's attention to this because it seems to have been overlooked and because some of the public journals speaking of the convention and no doubt uttering the sentiments of several of their readers say that they are disgusted with the transaction not because the french have been permitted to carry off a few diamonds or some ingots of silver but because we confessed by consenting to the treaty that an army of 35,000 british troops aided by the portugueze nation was not able to compel 20,000 french to surrender at discretion <\s>
<s> this is indeed the root of the evil as hath been shewn and it is the curse of this treaty that the several parts of it are of such enormity as singly to occupy the attention and to destroy comparison and coexistence <\s>
<s> but the people of great britain are disgusted both with the one and the other <\s>
<s> they bewail the violation of the principle if the value of the things carried off had been in itself trifling their grief and their indignation would have been scarcely less <\s>
<s> but it is manifest from what has been said that it was not trifling and that therefore upon that account as well as upon others this permission was no less impolitic than it was unjust and dishonourable <\s>
<s> in illustrating these articles of the armistice and convention by which the french were both expressly permitted and indirectly enabled to carry off their booty we have already seen that a concession was made which is still more enormous viz <\s>
<s> that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or resident there and all natives of portugal who have accepted situations under the french government c shall have their property of every kind guaranteed to them by the british army <\s>
<s> by articles 16th and 17th their persons are placed under the like protection <\s>
<s> the french article xvi shall be at liberty either to accompany the french army or to remain in portugal and the portugueze article xvii shall not be rendered accountable for their political conduct during the period of the occupation of the country by the french army they all are placed under the protection of the british commanders and shall sustain no injury in their property or persons <\s>
<s> i have animadverted heretofore upon the unprofessional eagerness of our generals to appear in the character of negotiators when the sword would have done them more service than the pen <\s>
<s> but if they had confined themselves to mere military regulations they might indeed with justice have been grievously censured as injudicious commanders whose notion of the honour of armies was of a low pitch and who had no conception of the peculiar nature of the service in which they were engaged but the censure must have stopped here <\s>
<s> whereas by these provisions they have shewn that they have never reflected upon the nature of military authority as contra distinguished from civil <\s>
<s> french example had so far dazzled and blinded them that the french army is suffered to denominate itself the french government and from the whole tenour of these instruments from the preamble and these articles especially it should seem that our generals fancied themselves and their army to be the british government <\s>
<s> for these regulations emanating from a mere military authority are purely civil but of such a kind that no power on earth could confer a right to establish them <\s>
<s> and this trampling upon the most sacred rights this sacrifice of the consciousness of a self preserving principle without which neither societies nor governments can exist is not made by our generals in relation to subjects of their own sovereign but to an independent nation our ally into whose territories we could not have entered but from its confidence in our friendship and good faith <\s>
<s> surely the persons who under the countenance of too high authority have talked so loudly of prejudging this question entirely overlooked or utterly forgot this part of it <\s>
<s> what have these monstrous provisions to do with the relative strength of the two armies or with any point admitting a doubt <\s>
<s> what need here of a court of judicature to settle who were the persons their names are subscribed by their own hands and to determine the quality of the thing <\s>
<s> actions and agents like these exhibited in this connection with each other must of necessity be condemned the moment they are known and to assert the contrary is to maintain that man is a being without understanding and that morality is an empty dream <\s>
<s> and if this condemnation must after this manner follow to utter it is less a duty than a further inevitable consequence from the constitution of human nature <\s>
<s> they who hold that the formal sanction of a court of judicature is in this case required before a people has a right to pass sentence know not to what degree they are enemies to that people and to mankind to what degree selfishness whether arising from their peculiar situation or from other causes has in them prevailed over those faculties which are our common inheritance and cut them off from fellowship with the species <\s>
<s> most deplorable would be the result if it were possible that the injunctions of these men could be obeyed or their remonstrances acknowledged to be just <\s>
<s> for not to mention that if it were not for such prompt decisions of the public voice misdemeanours of men high in office would rarely be accounted for at all we must bear in mind at this crisis that the adversary of all good is hourly and daily extending his ravages and according to such notions of fitness our indignation our sorrow our shame our sense of right and wrong and all those moral affections and powers of the understanding by which alone he can be effectually opposed are to enter upon a long vacation their motion is to be suspended a thing impossible if it could it would be destroyed <\s>
<s> let us now see what language the portugueze speak upon that part of the treaty which has incited me to give vent to these feelings and to assert these truths <\s>
<s> i protest says general friere against article xvii one of the two now under examination because it attempts to tie down the government of this kingdom not to bring to justice and condign punishment those persons who have been notoriously and scandalously disloyal to their prince and the country by joining and serving the french party and even if the english army should be allowed to screen them from the punishment they have deserved still it should not prevent their expulsion whereby this country would no longer have to fear being again betrayed by the same men <\s>
<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>
<s> couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange <\s>
<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>
<s> which amounts to this <\s>
<s> the french are called upon formally to relinquish in favour of the portugueze that to which they never had any right to abandon false claims which they either had a power to enforce or they had not if they departed immediately and had not power the article was nugatory if they remained a day longer and had power there was no security that they would abide by it <\s>
<s> accordingly loud complaints were made that after the date of the convention all kinds of ravages were committed by the french upon lisbon and its neighbourhood and what did it matter whether these were upon the plea of old debts and requisitions or new debts were created more greedily than ever from the consciousness that the time for collecting them was so short <\s>
<s> this article then the only one which is even in shew favourable to the portugueze is in substance nothing inasmuch as in what it is silent upon viz <\s>
<s> that the people of lisbon and its neighbourhood shall not be vexed and oppressed by the french during their stay with new claims and robberies it is grossly cruel or negligent and in that for which it actually stipulates wholly delusive <\s>
<s> it is in fact insulting for the very admission of a formal renunciation of these claims does to a certain degree acknowledge their justice <\s>
<s> the only decent manner of introducing matter to this effect would have been by placing it as a bye clause of a provision that secured the portugueze from further molestations and merely alluding to it as a thing understood of course <\s>
<s> yet from the place which this specious article occupies preceding immediately the 16th and 17th which we have been last considering it is clear that it must have been intended by the french general as honey smeared upon the edge of the cup to make the poison contained in those two more palateable <\s>
<s> thus much for the portugueze and their particular interests <\s>
<s> in one instance a concern of the spanish nation comes directly under notice and that nation also is treated without delicacy or feeling <\s>
<s> for by the 18th article it is agreed that the spaniards 4000 in number who had been disarmed and were confined on ship board in the port of lisbon by the french should be liberated <\s>
<s> and upon what consideration <\s>
<s> not upon their right to be free as having been treacherously and cruelly dealt with by men who were part of a power that was labouring to subjugate their country and in this attempt had committed inhuman crimes against it not even exchanged as soldiers against soldiers but the condition of their emancipation is that the british general engages to obtain of the spaniards to restore such french subjects either military or civil as have been detained in spain without having been taken in battle or in consequence of military operations but on account of the occurrences of the 29th of last may and the days immediately following <\s>
<s> i know not what are exactly the features of the face for which this word serves as a veil i have no register at hand to inform me what these events precisely were but there can be no doubt that it was a time of triumph for liberty and humanity and that the persons for whom these noble minded spaniards were to be exchanged were no other than a horde from among the most abject of the french nation probably those wretches who having never faced either the dangers or the fatigues of war had been most busy in secret preparations or were most conspicuous in open acts of massacre when the streets of madrid a few weeks before had been drenched with the blood of two thousand of her bravest citizens <\s>
<s> yet the liberation of these spaniards upon these terms is recorded in the report of the court of enquiry as one of the advantages which in the contemplation of the generals would result from the convention <\s>
<s> finally if there shall be any doubt article xiv as to the meaning of any article it shall be explained favourably to the french army and hostages article xx of the rank of field officers on the part of the british army and navy shall be furnished for the guarantee of the present convention <\s>
<s> i have now gone through the painful task of examining the most material conditions of the convention of cintra the whole number of the articles is twenty two with three additional ones a long ladder into a deep abyss of infamy need it be said that neglects injuries and insults like these which we have been contemplating come from what quarter they may let them be exhibited towards whom they will must produce not merely mistrust and jealousy but alienation and hatred <\s>

<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>

<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>

<s> thus much for the portugueze and their particular interests <\s>
<s> in one instance a concern of the spanish nation comes directly under notice and that nation also is treated without delicacy or feeling <\s>
<s> for by the 18th article it is agreed that the spaniards 4000 in number who had been disarmed and were confined on ship board in the port of lisbon by the french should be liberated <\s>
<s> and upon what consideration <\s>
<s> not upon their right to be free as having been treacherously and cruelly dealt with by men who were part of a power that was labouring to subjugate their country and in this attempt had committed inhuman crimes against it not even exchanged as soldiers against soldiers but the condition of their emancipation is that the british general engages to obtain of the spaniards to restore such french subjects either military or civil as have been detained in spain without having been taken in battle or in consequence of military operations but on account of the occurrences of the 29th of last may and the days immediately following <\s>
<s> i know not what are exactly the features of the face for which this word serves as a veil i have no register at hand to inform me what these events precisely were but there can be no doubt that it was a time of triumph for liberty and humanity and that the persons for whom these noble minded spaniards were to be exchanged were no other than a horde from among the most abject of the french nation probably those wretches who having never faced either the dangers or the fatigues of war had been most busy in secret preparations or were most conspicuous in open acts of massacre when the streets of madrid a few weeks before had been drenched with the blood of two thousand of her bravest citizens <\s>
<s> yet the liberation of these spaniards upon these terms is recorded in the report of the court of enquiry as one of the advantages which in the contemplation of the generals would result from the convention <\s>
<s> finally if there shall be any doubt article xiv as to the meaning of any article it shall be explained favourably to the french army and hostages article xx of the rank of field officers on the part of the british army and navy shall be furnished for the guarantee of the present convention <\s>
<s> i have now gone through the painful task of examining the most material conditions of the convention of cintra the whole number of the articles is twenty two with three additional ones a long ladder into a deep abyss of infamy need it be said that neglects injuries and insults like these which we have been contemplating come from what quarter they may let them be exhibited towards whom they will must produce not merely mistrust and jealousy but alienation and hatred <\s>
<s> the passions and feelings may be quieted or diverted for a short time but though out of sight or seemingly asleep they must exist and the life which they have received cannot but by a long course of justice and kindness be overcome and destroyed <\s>
<s> but why talk of a long course of justice and kindness when the immediate result must have been so deplorable <\s>
<s> relying upon our humanity our fellow feeling and our justice upon these instant and urgent claims sanctioned by the more mild one of ancient alliance the portugueze people by voices from every part of their land entreated our succour the arrival of a british army upon their coasts was joyfully hailed and the people of the country zealously assisted in landing the troops without which help as a british general has informed us that landing could not have been effected <\s>
<s> and it is in this manner that they are repaid <\s>
<s> to some port between rochefort and l'orient and be at liberty to serve i come to that memorable condition article v that the french army shall carry with it all its equipments that is to say its military chests and carriages attached to the field commissariat and field hospitals or shall be allowed to dispose of such part as the commander in chief may judge it unnecessary to embark <\s>
<s> in like manner all individuals of the army shall be at liberty to dispose of their private property of every description with full security hereafter for the purchasers <\s>
<s> this is expressed still more pointedly in the armistice though the meaning implied in the two articles is precisely the same <\s>
<s> for in the fifth article of the armistice it is agreed provisionally that all those of whom the french army consists shall be conveyed to france with arms and baggage and all their private property of every description no part of which shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> in the convention it is only expressed that they shall be at liberty to depart article ii with arms and baggage and article v to dispose of their private property of every description <\s>
<s> but if they had a right to dispose of it this would include a right to carry it away which was undoubtedly understood by the french general <\s>
<s> and in the armistice it is expressly said that their private property of every description shall be conveyed to france along with their persons <\s>
<s> what then are we to understand by the words their private property of every description <\s>
<s> equipments of the army in general and baggage of individuals had been stipulated for before now we all know that the lawful professional gains and earnings of a soldier must be small that he is not in the habit of carrying about him during actual warfare any accumulation of these or other property and that the ordinary private property which he can be supposed to have a just title to is included under the name of his baggage therefore this was something more and what it was is apparent <\s>
<s> no part of their property says the armistice shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> who does not see in these words the consciousness of guilt an indirect self betraying admission that they had in their hands treasures which might be lawfully taken from them and an anxiety to prevent that act of justice by a positive stipulation <\s>
<s> who does not see on what sort of property the frenchman had his eye that it was not property by right but their possessions their plunder every thing by what means soever acquired that the french army or any individual in it was possessed of <\s>
<s> but it has been urged that the monstrousness of such a supposition precludes this interpretation renders it impossible that it could either be intended by the one party or so understood by the other <\s>
<s> what right they who signed and he who ratified this convention have to shelter themselves under this plea will appear from the 16th and 17th articles <\s>
<s> in these it is stipulated that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or accidentally in the country shall have their property of every kind moveable and immoveable guaranteed to them with liberty of retaining or disposing of it and passing the produce into france the same is stipulated article xvii for such natives of portugal as have sided with the french or occupied situations under the french government <\s>
<s> here then is a direct avowal still more monstrous that every frenchman or native of a country in alliance with france however obnoxious his crimes may have made him and every traitorous portugueze shall have his property guaranteed to him both previously to and after the reinstatement of the portugueze government by the british army <\s>
<s> now let us ask what sense the word property must have had fastened to it in these cases <\s>
<s> must it not necessarily have included all the rewards which the frenchman had received for his iniquity and the traitorous portugueze for his treason <\s>
<s> for no man would bear a part in such oppressions or would be a traitor for nothing and moreover all the rewards which the french could bestow must have been taken from the portugueze extorted from the honest and loyal to be given to the wicked and disloyal these rewards of iniquity must necessarily have been included for on our side no attempt is made at a distinction and on the side of the french the word immoveable is manifestly intended to preclude such a distinction where alone it could have been effectual <\s>
<s> property then here means possessions thus infamously acquired and in the instance of the portugueze the fundamental notion of the word is subverted for a traitor can have no property till the government of his own country has remitted the punishment due to his crimes <\s>
<s> and these wages of guilt which the master by such exactions was enabled to pay and which the servant thus earned are to be guaranteed to him by a british army <\s>
<s> where does there exist a power on earth that could confer this right <\s>
<s> if the portugueze government itself had acted in this manner it would have been guilty of wilful suicide and the nation if it had acted so of high treason against itself <\s>
<s> let it not then be said that the monstrousness of covenanting to convey along with the persons of the french their plunder secures the article from the interpretation which the people of great britain gave and which i have now proved they were bound to give to it but conceding for a moment that it was not intended that the words should bear this sense and that neither in a fair grammatical construction nor as illustrated by other passages or by the general tenour of the document they actually did bear it had not unquestionable voices proclaimed the cruelty and rapacity the acts of sacrilege assassination and robbery by which these treasures had been amassed <\s>
<s> was not the perfidy of the french army and its contempt of moral obligation both as a body and as to the individuals which composed it infamous through europe therefore the concession would signify nothing for our generals by allowing an army of this character to depart with its equipments waggons military chest and baggage had provided abundant means to enable it to carry off whatsoever it desired and thus to elude and frustrate any stipulations which might have been made for compelling it to restore that which had been so iniquitously seized <\s>
<s> and here are we brought back to the fountain head of all this baseness to that apathy and deadness to the principle of justice through the influence of which this army outlawed by its crimes was suffered to depart from the land over which it had so long tyrannized other than as a band of disarmed prisoners i maintain therefore that permission to carry off the booty was distinctly expressed and if it had not been so that the principle of justice could not here be preserved as a violation of it must necessarily have followed from other conditions of the treaty <\s>
<s> sir hew dalrymple himself before the court of inquiry has told us in two letters to generals beresford and friere that such part of the plunder as was in money it would be difficult if not impossible to identify and consequently the french could not be prevented from carrying it away with them <\s>
<s> from the same letters we learn that the french were intending to carry off a considerable part of their plunder by calling it public money and saying that it belonged to the military chest and that their evasions of the article were most shameful and evinced a want of probity and honour which was most disgraceful to them <\s>
<s> if the french had given no other proofs of their want of such virtues than those furnished by this occasion neither the portugueze nor spanish nor british nations would condemn them nor hate them as they now do; nor would this article of the convention have excited such indignation <\s>
<s> for the french by so acting could not deem themselves breaking an engagement no doubt they looked upon themselves as injured that the failure in good faith was on the part of the british and that it was in the lawlessness of power and by a mere quibble that this construction was afterwards put upon the article in question <\s>
<s> widely different from the conduct of the british was that of the spaniards in a like case with high feeling did they abating not a jot or a tittle enforce the principle of justice <\s>
<s> how says the governor of cadiz to general dupont in the same noble letter before alluded to how says he after enumerating the afflictions which his army and the tyrant who had sent it had unjustly brought upon the spanish nation for of these in their dealings with the french they never for a moment lost sight how asks he could you expect that your army should carry off from spain the fruit of its rapacity cruelty and impiety <\s>
<s> how could you conceive this possible or that we should be so stupid or senseless <\s>
<s> and this conduct is as wise in reason as it is true to nature <\s>
<s> the spanish people could have had no confidence in their government if it had not acted thus <\s>
<s> these are the sympathies which prove that a government is paternal that it makes one family with the people besides it is only by such adherence to justice that in times of like commotion popular excesses can either be mitigated or prevented <\s>
<s> if we would be efficient allies of spain nay if we would not run the risk of doing infinite harm these sentiments must not only be ours as a nation but they must pervade the hearts of our ministers and our generals our agents and our ambassadors <\s>
<s> if it be not so they who are sent abroad must either be conscious how unworthy they are and with what unworthy commissions they appear or not if they do feel this then they must hang their heads and blush for their country and themselves if they do not the spaniards must blush for them and revolt from them or what would be ten thousand times more deplorable they must purchase a reconcilement and a communion by a sacrifice of all that is excellent in themselves <\s>
<s> spain must either break down her lofty spirit her animation and fiery courage to run side by side in the same trammels with great britain or she must start off from her intended yoke fellow with contempt and aversion <\s>
<s> this is the alternative and there is no avoiding it <\s>
<s> i have yet to speak of the influence of such concessions upon the french ruler and his army <\s>
<s> with what satanic pride must he have contemplated the devotion of his servants and adherents to their law the steadiness and zeal of their perverse loyalty and the faithfulness with which they stand by him and each other <\s>
<s> how must his heart have distended with false glory while he contrasted these qualities of his subjects with the insensibility and slackness of his british enemies <\s>

<s> spain must either break down her lofty spirit her animation and fiery courage to run side by side in the same trammels with great britain or she must start off from her intended yoke fellow with contempt and aversion <\s>
<s> this is the alternative and there is no avoiding it <\s>
<s> i have yet to speak of the influence of such concessions upon the french ruler and his army <\s>
<s> with what satanic pride must he have contemplated the devotion of his servants and adherents to their law the steadiness and zeal of their perverse loyalty and the faithfulness with which they stand by him and each other <\s>
<s> how must his heart have distended with false glory while he contrasted these qualities of his subjects with the insensibility and slackness of his british enemies <\s>
<s> this notice has however no especial propriety in this place for as far as concerns bonaparte his pride and depraved confidence may be equally fed by almost all the conditions of this instrument <\s>
<s> but as to his army it is plain that the permission whether it be considered as by an express article formally granted or only involved in the general conditions of the treaty to bear away in triumph the harvest of its crimes must not only have emboldened and exalted it with arrogance and whetted its rapacity but that hereby every soldier of which this army was composed must upon his arrival in his own country have been a seed which would give back plenteously in its kind <\s>
<s> the french are at present a needy people without commerce or manufactures unsettled in their minds and debased in their morals by revolutionary practices and habits of warfare and the youth of the country are rendered desperate by oppression which leaving no choice in their occupation discharges them from all responsibility to their own consciences <\s>
<s> how powerful then must have been the action of such incitements upon a people so circumstanced <\s>
<s> the actual sight and far more the imaginary sight and handling of these treasures magnified by the romantic tales which must have been spread about them would carry into every town and village an antidote for the terrors of conscription and would rouze men like the dreams imported from the new world when the first discoverers and adventurers returned with their ingots and their gold dust their stories and their promises to inflame and madden the avarice of the old <\s>
<s> what an effect says the governor of cadiz must it have upon the people he means the spanish people to know that a single soldier was carrying away 2580 livres tournois <\s>
<s> what an effect he might have said also must it have upon the french i direct the reader's attention to this because it seems to have been overlooked and because some of the public journals speaking of the convention and no doubt uttering the sentiments of several of their readers say that they are disgusted with the transaction not because the french have been permitted to carry off a few diamonds or some ingots of silver but because we confessed by consenting to the treaty that an army of 35,000 british troops aided by the portugueze nation was not able to compel 20,000 french to surrender at discretion <\s>
<s> this is indeed the root of the evil as hath been shewn and it is the curse of this treaty that the several parts of it are of such enormity as singly to occupy the attention and to destroy comparison and coexistence <\s>
<s> but the people of great britain are disgusted both with the one and the other <\s>
<s> they bewail the violation of the principle if the value of the things carried off had been in itself trifling their grief and their indignation would have been scarcely less <\s>
<s> but it is manifest from what has been said that it was not trifling and that therefore upon that account as well as upon others this permission was no less impolitic than it was unjust and dishonourable <\s>
<s> in illustrating these articles of the armistice and convention by which the french were both expressly permitted and indirectly enabled to carry off their booty we have already seen that a concession was made which is still more enormous viz <\s>
<s> that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or resident there and all natives of portugal who have accepted situations under the french government c shall have their property of every kind guaranteed to them by the british army <\s>
<s> by articles 16th and 17th their persons are placed under the like protection <\s>
<s> the french article xvi shall be at liberty either to accompany the french army or to remain in portugal and the portugueze article xvii shall not be rendered accountable for their political conduct during the period of the occupation of the country by the french army they all are placed under the protection of the british commanders and shall sustain no injury in their property or persons <\s>
<s> i have animadverted heretofore upon the unprofessional eagerness of our generals to appear in the character of negotiators when the sword would have done them more service than the pen <\s>
<s> but if they had confined themselves to mere military regulations they might indeed with justice have been grievously censured as injudicious commanders whose notion of the honour of armies was of a low pitch and who had no conception of the peculiar nature of the service in which they were engaged but the censure must have stopped here <\s>
<s> whereas by these provisions they have shewn that they have never reflected upon the nature of military authority as contra distinguished from civil <\s>
<s> french example had so far dazzled and blinded them that the french army is suffered to denominate itself the french government and from the whole tenour of these instruments from the preamble and these articles especially it should seem that our generals fancied themselves and their army to be the british government <\s>
<s> for these regulations emanating from a mere military authority are purely civil but of such a kind that no power on earth could confer a right to establish them <\s>
<s> and this trampling upon the most sacred rights this sacrifice of the consciousness of a self preserving principle without which neither societies nor governments can exist is not made by our generals in relation to subjects of their own sovereign but to an independent nation our ally into whose territories we could not have entered but from its confidence in our friendship and good faith <\s>
<s> surely the persons who under the countenance of too high authority have talked so loudly of prejudging this question entirely overlooked or utterly forgot this part of it <\s>
<s> what have these monstrous provisions to do with the relative strength of the two armies or with any point admitting a doubt <\s>
<s> what need here of a court of judicature to settle who were the persons their names are subscribed by their own hands and to determine the quality of the thing <\s>
<s> actions and agents like these exhibited in this connection with each other must of necessity be condemned the moment they are known and to assert the contrary is to maintain that man is a being without understanding and that morality is an empty dream <\s>
<s> and if this condemnation must after this manner follow to utter it is less a duty than a further inevitable consequence from the constitution of human nature <\s>
<s> they who hold that the formal sanction of a court of judicature is in this case required before a people has a right to pass sentence know not to what degree they are enemies to that people and to mankind to what degree selfishness whether arising from their peculiar situation or from other causes has in them prevailed over those faculties which are our common inheritance and cut them off from fellowship with the species <\s>
<s> most deplorable would be the result if it were possible that the injunctions of these men could be obeyed or their remonstrances acknowledged to be just <\s>
<s> for not to mention that if it were not for such prompt decisions of the public voice misdemeanours of men high in office would rarely be accounted for at all we must bear in mind at this crisis that the adversary of all good is hourly and daily extending his ravages and according to such notions of fitness our indignation our sorrow our shame our sense of right and wrong and all those moral affections and powers of the understanding by which alone he can be effectually opposed are to enter upon a long vacation their motion is to be suspended a thing impossible if it could it would be destroyed <\s>
<s> let us now see what language the portugueze speak upon that part of the treaty which has incited me to give vent to these feelings and to assert these truths <\s>
<s> i protest says general friere against article xvii one of the two now under examination because it attempts to tie down the government of this kingdom not to bring to justice and condign punishment those persons who have been notoriously and scandalously disloyal to their prince and the country by joining and serving the french party and even if the english army should be allowed to screen them from the punishment they have deserved still it should not prevent their expulsion whereby this country would no longer have to fear being again betrayed by the same men <\s>
<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>
<s> couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange <\s>
<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>
<s> which amounts to this <\s>
<s> the french are called upon formally to relinquish in favour of the portugueze that to which they never had any right to abandon false claims which they either had a power to enforce or they had not if they departed immediately and had not power the article was nugatory if they remained a day longer and had power there was no security that they would abide by it <\s>
<s> accordingly loud complaints were made that after the date of the convention all kinds of ravages were committed by the french upon lisbon and its neighbourhood and what did it matter whether these were upon the plea of old debts and requisitions or new debts were created more greedily than ever from the consciousness that the time for collecting them was so short <\s>
<s> this article then the only one which is even in shew favourable to the portugueze is in substance nothing inasmuch as in what it is silent upon viz <\s>
<s> that the people of lisbon and its neighbourhood shall not be vexed and oppressed by the french during their stay with new claims and robberies it is grossly cruel or negligent and in that for which it actually stipulates wholly delusive <\s>
<s> it is in fact insulting for the very admission of a formal renunciation of these claims does to a certain degree acknowledge their justice <\s>
<s> the only decent manner of introducing matter to this effect would have been by placing it as a bye clause of a provision that secured the portugueze from further molestations and merely alluding to it as a thing understood of course <\s>
<s> yet from the place which this specious article occupies preceding immediately the 16th and 17th which we have been last considering it is clear that it must have been intended by the french general as honey smeared upon the edge of the cup to make the poison contained in those two more palateable <\s>
<s> thus much for the portugueze and their particular interests <\s>
<s> in one instance a concern of the spanish nation comes directly under notice and that nation also is treated without delicacy or feeling <\s>
<s> for by the 18th article it is agreed that the spaniards 4000 in number who had been disarmed and were confined on ship board in the port of lisbon by the french should be liberated <\s>
<s> and upon what consideration <\s>
<s> not upon their right to be free as having been treacherously and cruelly dealt with by men who were part of a power that was labouring to subjugate their country and in this attempt had committed inhuman crimes against it not even exchanged as soldiers against soldiers but the condition of their emancipation is that the british general engages to obtain of the spaniards to restore such french subjects either military or civil as have been detained in spain without having been taken in battle or in consequence of military operations but on account of the occurrences of the 29th of last may and the days immediately following <\s>
<s> i know not what are exactly the features of the face for which this word serves as a veil i have no register at hand to inform me what these events precisely were but there can be no doubt that it was a time of triumph for liberty and humanity and that the persons for whom these noble minded spaniards were to be exchanged were no other than a horde from among the most abject of the french nation probably those wretches who having never faced either the dangers or the fatigues of war had been most busy in secret preparations or were most conspicuous in open acts of massacre when the streets of madrid a few weeks before had been drenched with the blood of two thousand of her bravest citizens <\s>
<s> yet the liberation of these spaniards upon these terms is recorded in the report of the court of enquiry as one of the advantages which in the contemplation of the generals would result from the convention <\s>
<s> finally if there shall be any doubt article xiv as to the meaning of any article it shall be explained favourably to the french army and hostages article xx of the rank of field officers on the part of the british army and navy shall be furnished for the guarantee of the present convention <\s>
<s> i have now gone through the painful task of examining the most material conditions of the convention of cintra the whole number of the articles is twenty two with three additional ones a long ladder into a deep abyss of infamy need it be said that neglects injuries and insults like these which we have been contemplating come from what quarter they may let them be exhibited towards whom they will must produce not merely mistrust and jealousy but alienation and hatred <\s>

<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>
<s> couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange <\s>
<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>
<s> which amounts to this <\s>
<s> the french are called upon formally to relinquish in favour of the portugueze that to which they never had any right to abandon false claims which they either had a power to enforce or they had not if they departed immediately and had not power the article was nugatory if they remained a day longer and had power there was no security that they would abide by it <\s>
<s> accordingly loud complaints were made that after the date of the convention all kinds of ravages were committed by the french upon lisbon and its neighbourhood and what did it matter whether these were upon the plea of old debts and requisitions or new debts were created more greedily than ever from the consciousness that the time for collecting them was so short <\s>
<s> this article then the only one which is even in shew favourable to the portugueze is in substance nothing inasmuch as in what it is silent upon viz <\s>
<s> that the people of lisbon and its neighbourhood shall not be vexed and oppressed by the french during their stay with new claims and robberies it is grossly cruel or negligent and in that for which it actually stipulates wholly delusive <\s>

<s> thus much for the portugueze and their particular interests <\s>
<s> in one instance a concern of the spanish nation comes directly under notice and that nation also is treated without delicacy or feeling <\s>
<s> for by the 18th article it is agreed that the spaniards 4000 in number who had been disarmed and were confined on ship board in the port of lisbon by the french should be liberated <\s>
<s> and upon what consideration <\s>
<s> not upon their right to be free as having been treacherously and cruelly dealt with by men who were part of a power that was labouring to subjugate their country and in this attempt had committed inhuman crimes against it not even exchanged as soldiers against soldiers but the condition of their emancipation is that the british general engages to obtain of the spaniards to restore such french subjects either military or civil as have been detained in spain without having been taken in battle or in consequence of military operations but on account of the occurrences of the 29th of last may and the days immediately following <\s>
<s> i know not what are exactly the features of the face for which this word serves as a veil i have no register at hand to inform me what these events precisely were but there can be no doubt that it was a time of triumph for liberty and humanity and that the persons for whom these noble minded spaniards were to be exchanged were no other than a horde from among the most abject of the french nation probably those wretches who having never faced either the dangers or the fatigues of war had been most busy in secret preparations or were most conspicuous in open acts of massacre when the streets of madrid a few weeks before had been drenched with the blood of two thousand of her bravest citizens <\s>
<s> yet the liberation of these spaniards upon these terms is recorded in the report of the court of enquiry as one of the advantages which in the contemplation of the generals would result from the convention <\s>
<s> finally if there shall be any doubt article xiv as to the meaning of any article it shall be explained favourably to the french army and hostages article xx of the rank of field officers on the part of the british army and navy shall be furnished for the guarantee of the present convention <\s>
<s> i have now gone through the painful task of examining the most material conditions of the convention of cintra the whole number of the articles is twenty two with three additional ones a long ladder into a deep abyss of infamy need it be said that neglects injuries and insults like these which we have been contemplating come from what quarter they may let them be exhibited towards whom they will must produce not merely mistrust and jealousy but alienation and hatred <\s>
<s> the passions and feelings may be quieted or diverted for a short time but though out of sight or seemingly asleep they must exist and the life which they have received cannot but by a long course of justice and kindness be overcome and destroyed <\s>
<s> but why talk of a long course of justice and kindness when the immediate result must have been so deplorable <\s>
<s> relying upon our humanity our fellow feeling and our justice upon these instant and urgent claims sanctioned by the more mild one of ancient alliance the portugueze people by voices from every part of their land entreated our succour the arrival of a british army upon their coasts was joyfully hailed and the people of the country zealously assisted in landing the troops without which help as a british general has informed us that landing could not have been effected <\s>
<s> and it is in this manner that they are repaid <\s>
<s> to some port between rochefort and l'orient and be at liberty to serve i come to that memorable condition article v that the french army shall carry with it all its equipments that is to say its military chests and carriages attached to the field commissariat and field hospitals or shall be allowed to dispose of such part as the commander in chief may judge it unnecessary to embark <\s>
<s> in like manner all individuals of the army shall be at liberty to dispose of their private property of every description with full security hereafter for the purchasers <\s>
<s> this is expressed still more pointedly in the armistice though the meaning implied in the two articles is precisely the same <\s>
<s> for in the fifth article of the armistice it is agreed provisionally that all those of whom the french army consists shall be conveyed to france with arms and baggage and all their private property of every description no part of which shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> in the convention it is only expressed that they shall be at liberty to depart article ii with arms and baggage and article v to dispose of their private property of every description <\s>
<s> but if they had a right to dispose of it this would include a right to carry it away which was undoubtedly understood by the french general <\s>
<s> and in the armistice it is expressly said that their private property of every description shall be conveyed to france along with their persons <\s>
<s> what then are we to understand by the words their private property of every description <\s>
<s> equipments of the army in general and baggage of individuals had been stipulated for before now we all know that the lawful professional gains and earnings of a soldier must be small that he is not in the habit of carrying about him during actual warfare any accumulation of these or other property and that the ordinary private property which he can be supposed to have a just title to is included under the name of his baggage therefore this was something more and what it was is apparent <\s>
<s> no part of their property says the armistice shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> who does not see in these words the consciousness of guilt an indirect self betraying admission that they had in their hands treasures which might be lawfully taken from them and an anxiety to prevent that act of justice by a positive stipulation <\s>
<s> who does not see on what sort of property the frenchman had his eye that it was not property by right but their possessions their plunder every thing by what means soever acquired that the french army or any individual in it was possessed of <\s>
<s> but it has been urged that the monstrousness of such a supposition precludes this interpretation renders it impossible that it could either be intended by the one party or so understood by the other <\s>
<s> what right they who signed and he who ratified this convention have to shelter themselves under this plea will appear from the 16th and 17th articles <\s>
<s> in these it is stipulated that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or accidentally in the country shall have their property of every kind moveable and immoveable guaranteed to them with liberty of retaining or disposing of it and passing the produce into france the same is stipulated article xvii for such natives of portugal as have sided with the french or occupied situations under the french government <\s>
<s> here then is a direct avowal still more monstrous that every frenchman or native of a country in alliance with france however obnoxious his crimes may have made him and every traitorous portugueze shall have his property guaranteed to him both previously to and after the reinstatement of the portugueze government by the british army <\s>
<s> now let us ask what sense the word property must have had fastened to it in these cases <\s>
<s> must it not necessarily have included all the rewards which the frenchman had received for his iniquity and the traitorous portugueze for his treason <\s>
<s> for no man would bear a part in such oppressions or would be a traitor for nothing and moreover all the rewards which the french could bestow must have been taken from the portugueze extorted from the honest and loyal to be given to the wicked and disloyal these rewards of iniquity must necessarily have been included for on our side no attempt is made at a distinction and on the side of the french the word immoveable is manifestly intended to preclude such a distinction where alone it could have been effectual <\s>
<s> property then here means possessions thus infamously acquired and in the instance of the portugueze the fundamental notion of the word is subverted for a traitor can have no property till the government of his own country has remitted the punishment due to his crimes <\s>
<s> and these wages of guilt which the master by such exactions was enabled to pay and which the servant thus earned are to be guaranteed to him by a british army <\s>
<s> where does there exist a power on earth that could confer this right <\s>
<s> if the portugueze government itself had acted in this manner it would have been guilty of wilful suicide and the nation if it had acted so of high treason against itself <\s>
<s> let it not then be said that the monstrousness of covenanting to convey along with the persons of the french their plunder secures the article from the interpretation which the people of great britain gave and which i have now proved they were bound to give to it but conceding for a moment that it was not intended that the words should bear this sense and that neither in a fair grammatical construction nor as illustrated by other passages or by the general tenour of the document they actually did bear it had not unquestionable voices proclaimed the cruelty and rapacity the acts of sacrilege assassination and robbery by which these treasures had been amassed <\s>
<s> was not the perfidy of the french army and its contempt of moral obligation both as a body and as to the individuals which composed it infamous through europe therefore the concession would signify nothing for our generals by allowing an army of this character to depart with its equipments waggons military chest and baggage had provided abundant means to enable it to carry off whatsoever it desired and thus to elude and frustrate any stipulations which might have been made for compelling it to restore that which had been so iniquitously seized <\s>
<s> and here are we brought back to the fountain head of all this baseness to that apathy and deadness to the principle of justice through the influence of which this army outlawed by its crimes was suffered to depart from the land over which it had so long tyrannized other than as a band of disarmed prisoners i maintain therefore that permission to carry off the booty was distinctly expressed and if it had not been so that the principle of justice could not here be preserved as a violation of it must necessarily have followed from other conditions of the treaty <\s>
<s> sir hew dalrymple himself before the court of inquiry has told us in two letters to generals beresford and friere that such part of the plunder as was in money it would be difficult if not impossible to identify and consequently the french could not be prevented from carrying it away with them <\s>
<s> from the same letters we learn that the french were intending to carry off a considerable part of their plunder by calling it public money and saying that it belonged to the military chest and that their evasions of the article were most shameful and evinced a want of probity and honour which was most disgraceful to them <\s>
<s> if the french had given no other proofs of their want of such virtues than those furnished by this occasion neither the portugueze nor spanish nor british nations would condemn them nor hate them as they now do; nor would this article of the convention have excited such indignation <\s>
<s> for the french by so acting could not deem themselves breaking an engagement no doubt they looked upon themselves as injured that the failure in good faith was on the part of the british and that it was in the lawlessness of power and by a mere quibble that this construction was afterwards put upon the article in question <\s>
<s> widely different from the conduct of the british was that of the spaniards in a like case with high feeling did they abating not a jot or a tittle enforce the principle of justice <\s>
<s> how says the governor of cadiz to general dupont in the same noble letter before alluded to how says he after enumerating the afflictions which his army and the tyrant who had sent it had unjustly brought upon the spanish nation for of these in their dealings with the french they never for a moment lost sight how asks he could you expect that your army should carry off from spain the fruit of its rapacity cruelty and impiety <\s>
<s> how could you conceive this possible or that we should be so stupid or senseless <\s>
<s> and this conduct is as wise in reason as it is true to nature <\s>
<s> the spanish people could have had no confidence in their government if it had not acted thus <\s>
<s> these are the sympathies which prove that a government is paternal that it makes one family with the people besides it is only by such adherence to justice that in times of like commotion popular excesses can either be mitigated or prevented <\s>
<s> if we would be efficient allies of spain nay if we would not run the risk of doing infinite harm these sentiments must not only be ours as a nation but they must pervade the hearts of our ministers and our generals our agents and our ambassadors <\s>

<s> widely different from the conduct of the british was that of the spaniards in a like case with high feeling did they abating not a jot or a tittle enforce the principle of justice <\s>

<s> how could you conceive this possible or that we should be so stupid or senseless <\s>
<s> and this conduct is as wise in reason as it is true to nature <\s>

<s> if we would be efficient allies of spain nay if we would not run the risk of doing infinite harm these sentiments must not only be ours as a nation but they must pervade the hearts of our ministers and our generals our agents and our ambassadors <\s>

<s> spain must either break down her lofty spirit her animation and fiery courage to run side by side in the same trammels with great britain or she must start off from her intended yoke fellow with contempt and aversion <\s>
<s> this is the alternative and there is no avoiding it <\s>
<s> i have yet to speak of the influence of such concessions upon the french ruler and his army <\s>
<s> with what satanic pride must he have contemplated the devotion of his servants and adherents to their law the steadiness and zeal of their perverse loyalty and the faithfulness with which they stand by him and each other <\s>
<s> how must his heart have distended with false glory while he contrasted these qualities of his subjects with the insensibility and slackness of his british enemies <\s>
<s> this notice has however no especial propriety in this place for as far as concerns bonaparte his pride and depraved confidence may be equally fed by almost all the conditions of this instrument <\s>
<s> but as to his army it is plain that the permission whether it be considered as by an express article formally granted or only involved in the general conditions of the treaty to bear away in triumph the harvest of its crimes must not only have emboldened and exalted it with arrogance and whetted its rapacity but that hereby every soldier of which this army was composed must upon his arrival in his own country have been a seed which would give back plenteously in its kind <\s>
<s> the french are at present a needy people without commerce or manufactures unsettled in their minds and debased in their morals by revolutionary practices and habits of warfare and the youth of the country are rendered desperate by oppression which leaving no choice in their occupation discharges them from all responsibility to their own consciences <\s>
<s> how powerful then must have been the action of such incitements upon a people so circumstanced <\s>
<s> the actual sight and far more the imaginary sight and handling of these treasures magnified by the romantic tales which must have been spread about them would carry into every town and village an antidote for the terrors of conscription and would rouze men like the dreams imported from the new world when the first discoverers and adventurers returned with their ingots and their gold dust their stories and their promises to inflame and madden the avarice of the old <\s>
<s> what an effect says the governor of cadiz must it have upon the people he means the spanish people to know that a single soldier was carrying away 2580 livres tournois <\s>
<s> what an effect he might have said also must it have upon the french i direct the reader's attention to this because it seems to have been overlooked and because some of the public journals speaking of the convention and no doubt uttering the sentiments of several of their readers say that they are disgusted with the transaction not because the french have been permitted to carry off a few diamonds or some ingots of silver but because we confessed by consenting to the treaty that an army of 35,000 british troops aided by the portugueze nation was not able to compel 20,000 french to surrender at discretion <\s>
<s> this is indeed the root of the evil as hath been shewn and it is the curse of this treaty that the several parts of it are of such enormity as singly to occupy the attention and to destroy comparison and coexistence <\s>
<s> but the people of great britain are disgusted both with the one and the other <\s>
<s> they bewail the violation of the principle if the value of the things carried off had been in itself trifling their grief and their indignation would have been scarcely less <\s>
<s> but it is manifest from what has been said that it was not trifling and that therefore upon that account as well as upon others this permission was no less impolitic than it was unjust and dishonourable <\s>
<s> in illustrating these articles of the armistice and convention by which the french were both expressly permitted and indirectly enabled to carry off their booty we have already seen that a concession was made which is still more enormous viz <\s>
<s> that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or resident there and all natives of portugal who have accepted situations under the french government c shall have their property of every kind guaranteed to them by the british army <\s>
<s> by articles 16th and 17th their persons are placed under the like protection <\s>
<s> the french article xvi shall be at liberty either to accompany the french army or to remain in portugal and the portugueze article xvii shall not be rendered accountable for their political conduct during the period of the occupation of the country by the french army they all are placed under the protection of the british commanders and shall sustain no injury in their property or persons <\s>
<s> i have animadverted heretofore upon the unprofessional eagerness of our generals to appear in the character of negotiators when the sword would have done them more service than the pen <\s>
<s> but if they had confined themselves to mere military regulations they might indeed with justice have been grievously censured as injudicious commanders whose notion of the honour of armies was of a low pitch and who had no conception of the peculiar nature of the service in which they were engaged but the censure must have stopped here <\s>
<s> whereas by these provisions they have shewn that they have never reflected upon the nature of military authority as contra distinguished from civil <\s>
<s> french example had so far dazzled and blinded them that the french army is suffered to denominate itself the french government and from the whole tenour of these instruments from the preamble and these articles especially it should seem that our generals fancied themselves and their army to be the british government <\s>
<s> for these regulations emanating from a mere military authority are purely civil but of such a kind that no power on earth could confer a right to establish them <\s>
<s> and this trampling upon the most sacred rights this sacrifice of the consciousness of a self preserving principle without which neither societies nor governments can exist is not made by our generals in relation to subjects of their own sovereign but to an independent nation our ally into whose territories we could not have entered but from its confidence in our friendship and good faith <\s>
<s> surely the persons who under the countenance of too high authority have talked so loudly of prejudging this question entirely overlooked or utterly forgot this part of it <\s>
<s> what have these monstrous provisions to do with the relative strength of the two armies or with any point admitting a doubt <\s>
<s> what need here of a court of judicature to settle who were the persons their names are subscribed by their own hands and to determine the quality of the thing <\s>
<s> actions and agents like these exhibited in this connection with each other must of necessity be condemned the moment they are known and to assert the contrary is to maintain that man is a being without understanding and that morality is an empty dream <\s>
<s> and if this condemnation must after this manner follow to utter it is less a duty than a further inevitable consequence from the constitution of human nature <\s>
<s> they who hold that the formal sanction of a court of judicature is in this case required before a people has a right to pass sentence know not to what degree they are enemies to that people and to mankind to what degree selfishness whether arising from their peculiar situation or from other causes has in them prevailed over those faculties which are our common inheritance and cut them off from fellowship with the species <\s>
<s> most deplorable would be the result if it were possible that the injunctions of these men could be obeyed or their remonstrances acknowledged to be just <\s>
<s> for not to mention that if it were not for such prompt decisions of the public voice misdemeanours of men high in office would rarely be accounted for at all we must bear in mind at this crisis that the adversary of all good is hourly and daily extending his ravages and according to such notions of fitness our indignation our sorrow our shame our sense of right and wrong and all those moral affections and powers of the understanding by which alone he can be effectually opposed are to enter upon a long vacation their motion is to be suspended a thing impossible if it could it would be destroyed <\s>
<s> let us now see what language the portugueze speak upon that part of the treaty which has incited me to give vent to these feelings and to assert these truths <\s>
<s> i protest says general friere against article xvii one of the two now under examination because it attempts to tie down the government of this kingdom not to bring to justice and condign punishment those persons who have been notoriously and scandalously disloyal to their prince and the country by joining and serving the french party and even if the english army should be allowed to screen them from the punishment they have deserved still it should not prevent their expulsion whereby this country would no longer have to fear being again betrayed by the same men <\s>
<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>
<s> couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange <\s>
<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>
<s> which amounts to this <\s>
<s> the french are called upon formally to relinquish in favour of the portugueze that to which they never had any right to abandon false claims which they either had a power to enforce or they had not if they departed immediately and had not power the article was nugatory if they remained a day longer and had power there was no security that they would abide by it <\s>
<s> accordingly loud complaints were made that after the date of the convention all kinds of ravages were committed by the french upon lisbon and its neighbourhood and what did it matter whether these were upon the plea of old debts and requisitions or new debts were created more greedily than ever from the consciousness that the time for collecting them was so short <\s>
<s> this article then the only one which is even in shew favourable to the portugueze is in substance nothing inasmuch as in what it is silent upon viz <\s>
<s> that the people of lisbon and its neighbourhood shall not be vexed and oppressed by the french during their stay with new claims and robberies it is grossly cruel or negligent and in that for which it actually stipulates wholly delusive <\s>
<s> it is in fact insulting for the very admission of a formal renunciation of these claims does to a certain degree acknowledge their justice <\s>
<s> the only decent manner of introducing matter to this effect would have been by placing it as a bye clause of a provision that secured the portugueze from further molestations and merely alluding to it as a thing understood of course <\s>
<s> yet from the place which this specious article occupies preceding immediately the 16th and 17th which we have been last considering it is clear that it must have been intended by the french general as honey smeared upon the edge of the cup to make the poison contained in those two more palateable <\s>

<s> let us now see what language the portugueze speak upon that part of the treaty which has incited me to give vent to these feelings and to assert these truths <\s>
<s> i protest says general friere against article xvii one of the two now under examination because it attempts to tie down the government of this kingdom not to bring to justice and condign punishment those persons who have been notoriously and scandalously disloyal to their prince and the country by joining and serving the french party and even if the english army should be allowed to screen them from the punishment they have deserved still it should not prevent their expulsion whereby this country would no longer have to fear being again betrayed by the same men <\s>
<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>
<s> couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange <\s>
<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>
<s> which amounts to this <\s>
<s> the french are called upon formally to relinquish in favour of the portugueze that to which they never had any right to abandon false claims which they either had a power to enforce or they had not if they departed immediately and had not power the article was nugatory if they remained a day longer and had power there was no security that they would abide by it <\s>
<s> accordingly loud complaints were made that after the date of the convention all kinds of ravages were committed by the french upon lisbon and its neighbourhood and what did it matter whether these were upon the plea of old debts and requisitions or new debts were created more greedily than ever from the consciousness that the time for collecting them was so short <\s>
<s> this article then the only one which is even in shew favourable to the portugueze is in substance nothing inasmuch as in what it is silent upon viz <\s>
<s> that the people of lisbon and its neighbourhood shall not be vexed and oppressed by the french during their stay with new claims and robberies it is grossly cruel or negligent and in that for which it actually stipulates wholly delusive <\s>
<s> it is in fact insulting for the very admission of a formal renunciation of these claims does to a certain degree acknowledge their justice <\s>
<s> the only decent manner of introducing matter to this effect would have been by placing it as a bye clause of a provision that secured the portugueze from further molestations and merely alluding to it as a thing understood of course <\s>
<s> yet from the place which this specious article occupies preceding immediately the 16th and 17th which we have been last considering it is clear that it must have been intended by the french general as honey smeared upon the edge of the cup to make the poison contained in those two more palateable <\s>
<s> thus much for the portugueze and their particular interests <\s>
<s> in one instance a concern of the spanish nation comes directly under notice and that nation also is treated without delicacy or feeling <\s>
<s> for by the 18th article it is agreed that the spaniards 4000 in number who had been disarmed and were confined on ship board in the port of lisbon by the french should be liberated <\s>
<s> and upon what consideration <\s>
<s> not upon their right to be free as having been treacherously and cruelly dealt with by men who were part of a power that was labouring to subjugate their country and in this attempt had committed inhuman crimes against it not even exchanged as soldiers against soldiers but the condition of their emancipation is that the british general engages to obtain of the spaniards to restore such french subjects either military or civil as have been detained in spain without having been taken in battle or in consequence of military operations but on account of the occurrences of the 29th of last may and the days immediately following <\s>
<s> i know not what are exactly the features of the face for which this word serves as a veil i have no register at hand to inform me what these events precisely were but there can be no doubt that it was a time of triumph for liberty and humanity and that the persons for whom these noble minded spaniards were to be exchanged were no other than a horde from among the most abject of the french nation probably those wretches who having never faced either the dangers or the fatigues of war had been most busy in secret preparations or were most conspicuous in open acts of massacre when the streets of madrid a few weeks before had been drenched with the blood of two thousand of her bravest citizens <\s>
<s> yet the liberation of these spaniards upon these terms is recorded in the report of the court of enquiry as one of the advantages which in the contemplation of the generals would result from the convention <\s>
<s> finally if there shall be any doubt article xiv as to the meaning of any article it shall be explained favourably to the french army and hostages article xx of the rank of field officers on the part of the british army and navy shall be furnished for the guarantee of the present convention <\s>
<s> i have now gone through the painful task of examining the most material conditions of the convention of cintra the whole number of the articles is twenty two with three additional ones a long ladder into a deep abyss of infamy need it be said that neglects injuries and insults like these which we have been contemplating come from what quarter they may let them be exhibited towards whom they will must produce not merely mistrust and jealousy but alienation and hatred <\s>
<s> the passions and feelings may be quieted or diverted for a short time but though out of sight or seemingly asleep they must exist and the life which they have received cannot but by a long course of justice and kindness be overcome and destroyed <\s>
<s> but why talk of a long course of justice and kindness when the immediate result must have been so deplorable <\s>
<s> relying upon our humanity our fellow feeling and our justice upon these instant and urgent claims sanctioned by the more mild one of ancient alliance the portugueze people by voices from every part of their land entreated our succour the arrival of a british army upon their coasts was joyfully hailed and the people of the country zealously assisted in landing the troops without which help as a british general has informed us that landing could not have been effected <\s>
<s> and it is in this manner that they are repaid <\s>
<s> to some port between rochefort and l'orient and be at liberty to serve i come to that memorable condition article v that the french army shall carry with it all its equipments that is to say its military chests and carriages attached to the field commissariat and field hospitals or shall be allowed to dispose of such part as the commander in chief may judge it unnecessary to embark <\s>
<s> in like manner all individuals of the army shall be at liberty to dispose of their private property of every description with full security hereafter for the purchasers <\s>
<s> this is expressed still more pointedly in the armistice though the meaning implied in the two articles is precisely the same <\s>
<s> for in the fifth article of the armistice it is agreed provisionally that all those of whom the french army consists shall be conveyed to france with arms and baggage and all their private property of every description no part of which shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> in the convention it is only expressed that they shall be at liberty to depart article ii with arms and baggage and article v to dispose of their private property of every description <\s>
<s> but if they had a right to dispose of it this would include a right to carry it away which was undoubtedly understood by the french general <\s>
<s> and in the armistice it is expressly said that their private property of every description shall be conveyed to france along with their persons <\s>
<s> what then are we to understand by the words their private property of every description <\s>
<s> equipments of the army in general and baggage of individuals had been stipulated for before now we all know that the lawful professional gains and earnings of a soldier must be small that he is not in the habit of carrying about him during actual warfare any accumulation of these or other property and that the ordinary private property which he can be supposed to have a just title to is included under the name of his baggage therefore this was something more and what it was is apparent <\s>
<s> no part of their property says the armistice shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> who does not see in these words the consciousness of guilt an indirect self betraying admission that they had in their hands treasures which might be lawfully taken from them and an anxiety to prevent that act of justice by a positive stipulation <\s>
<s> who does not see on what sort of property the frenchman had his eye that it was not property by right but their possessions their plunder every thing by what means soever acquired that the french army or any individual in it was possessed of <\s>
<s> but it has been urged that the monstrousness of such a supposition precludes this interpretation renders it impossible that it could either be intended by the one party or so understood by the other <\s>
<s> what right they who signed and he who ratified this convention have to shelter themselves under this plea will appear from the 16th and 17th articles <\s>
<s> in these it is stipulated that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or accidentally in the country shall have their property of every kind moveable and immoveable guaranteed to them with liberty of retaining or disposing of it and passing the produce into france the same is stipulated article xvii for such natives of portugal as have sided with the french or occupied situations under the french government <\s>
<s> here then is a direct avowal still more monstrous that every frenchman or native of a country in alliance with france however obnoxious his crimes may have made him and every traitorous portugueze shall have his property guaranteed to him both previously to and after the reinstatement of the portugueze government by the british army <\s>
<s> now let us ask what sense the word property must have had fastened to it in these cases <\s>
<s> must it not necessarily have included all the rewards which the frenchman had received for his iniquity and the traitorous portugueze for his treason <\s>
<s> for no man would bear a part in such oppressions or would be a traitor for nothing and moreover all the rewards which the french could bestow must have been taken from the portugueze extorted from the honest and loyal to be given to the wicked and disloyal these rewards of iniquity must necessarily have been included for on our side no attempt is made at a distinction and on the side of the french the word immoveable is manifestly intended to preclude such a distinction where alone it could have been effectual <\s>
<s> property then here means possessions thus infamously acquired and in the instance of the portugueze the fundamental notion of the word is subverted for a traitor can have no property till the government of his own country has remitted the punishment due to his crimes <\s>
<s> and these wages of guilt which the master by such exactions was enabled to pay and which the servant thus earned are to be guaranteed to him by a british army <\s>
<s> where does there exist a power on earth that could confer this right <\s>
<s> if the portugueze government itself had acted in this manner it would have been guilty of wilful suicide and the nation if it had acted so of high treason against itself <\s>
<s> let it not then be said that the monstrousness of covenanting to convey along with the persons of the french their plunder secures the article from the interpretation which the people of great britain gave and which i have now proved they were bound to give to it but conceding for a moment that it was not intended that the words should bear this sense and that neither in a fair grammatical construction nor as illustrated by other passages or by the general tenour of the document they actually did bear it had not unquestionable voices proclaimed the cruelty and rapacity the acts of sacrilege assassination and robbery by which these treasures had been amassed <\s>
<s> was not the perfidy of the french army and its contempt of moral obligation both as a body and as to the individuals which composed it infamous through europe therefore the concession would signify nothing for our generals by allowing an army of this character to depart with its equipments waggons military chest and baggage had provided abundant means to enable it to carry off whatsoever it desired and thus to elude and frustrate any stipulations which might have been made for compelling it to restore that which had been so iniquitously seized <\s>
<s> and here are we brought back to the fountain head of all this baseness to that apathy and deadness to the principle of justice through the influence of which this army outlawed by its crimes was suffered to depart from the land over which it had so long tyrannized other than as a band of disarmed prisoners i maintain therefore that permission to carry off the booty was distinctly expressed and if it had not been so that the principle of justice could not here be preserved as a violation of it must necessarily have followed from other conditions of the treaty <\s>
<s> sir hew dalrymple himself before the court of inquiry has told us in two letters to generals beresford and friere that such part of the plunder as was in money it would be difficult if not impossible to identify and consequently the french could not be prevented from carrying it away with them <\s>
<s> from the same letters we learn that the french were intending to carry off a considerable part of their plunder by calling it public money and saying that it belonged to the military chest and that their evasions of the article were most shameful and evinced a want of probity and honour which was most disgraceful to them <\s>
<s> if the french had given no other proofs of their want of such virtues than those furnished by this occasion neither the portugueze nor spanish nor british nations would condemn them nor hate them as they now do; nor would this article of the convention have excited such indignation <\s>
<s> for the french by so acting could not deem themselves breaking an engagement no doubt they looked upon themselves as injured that the failure in good faith was on the part of the british and that it was in the lawlessness of power and by a mere quibble that this construction was afterwards put upon the article in question <\s>
<s> widely different from the conduct of the british was that of the spaniards in a like case with high feeling did they abating not a jot or a tittle enforce the principle of justice <\s>
<s> how says the governor of cadiz to general dupont in the same noble letter before alluded to how says he after enumerating the afflictions which his army and the tyrant who had sent it had unjustly brought upon the spanish nation for of these in their dealings with the french they never for a moment lost sight how asks he could you expect that your army should carry off from spain the fruit of its rapacity cruelty and impiety <\s>

<s> widely different from the conduct of the british was that of the spaniards in a like case with high feeling did they abating not a jot or a tittle enforce the principle of justice <\s>
<s> how says the governor of cadiz to general dupont in the same noble letter before alluded to how says he after enumerating the afflictions which his army and the tyrant who had sent it had unjustly brought upon the spanish nation for of these in their dealings with the french they never for a moment lost sight how asks he could you expect that your army should carry off from spain the fruit of its rapacity cruelty and impiety <\s>
<s> how could you conceive this possible or that we should be so stupid or senseless <\s>
<s> and this conduct is as wise in reason as it is true to nature <\s>
<s> the spanish people could have had no confidence in their government if it had not acted thus <\s>
<s> these are the sympathies which prove that a government is paternal that it makes one family with the people besides it is only by such adherence to justice that in times of like commotion popular excesses can either be mitigated or prevented <\s>
<s> if we would be efficient allies of spain nay if we would not run the risk of doing infinite harm these sentiments must not only be ours as a nation but they must pervade the hearts of our ministers and our generals our agents and our ambassadors <\s>
<s> if it be not so they who are sent abroad must either be conscious how unworthy they are and with what unworthy commissions they appear or not if they do feel this then they must hang their heads and blush for their country and themselves if they do not the spaniards must blush for them and revolt from them or what would be ten thousand times more deplorable they must purchase a reconcilement and a communion by a sacrifice of all that is excellent in themselves <\s>
<s> spain must either break down her lofty spirit her animation and fiery courage to run side by side in the same trammels with great britain or she must start off from her intended yoke fellow with contempt and aversion <\s>
<s> this is the alternative and there is no avoiding it <\s>
<s> i have yet to speak of the influence of such concessions upon the french ruler and his army <\s>
<s> with what satanic pride must he have contemplated the devotion of his servants and adherents to their law the steadiness and zeal of their perverse loyalty and the faithfulness with which they stand by him and each other <\s>
<s> how must his heart have distended with false glory while he contrasted these qualities of his subjects with the insensibility and slackness of his british enemies <\s>
<s> this notice has however no especial propriety in this place for as far as concerns bonaparte his pride and depraved confidence may be equally fed by almost all the conditions of this instrument <\s>
<s> but as to his army it is plain that the permission whether it be considered as by an express article formally granted or only involved in the general conditions of the treaty to bear away in triumph the harvest of its crimes must not only have emboldened and exalted it with arrogance and whetted its rapacity but that hereby every soldier of which this army was composed must upon his arrival in his own country have been a seed which would give back plenteously in its kind <\s>
<s> the french are at present a needy people without commerce or manufactures unsettled in their minds and debased in their morals by revolutionary practices and habits of warfare and the youth of the country are rendered desperate by oppression which leaving no choice in their occupation discharges them from all responsibility to their own consciences <\s>
<s> how powerful then must have been the action of such incitements upon a people so circumstanced <\s>
<s> the actual sight and far more the imaginary sight and handling of these treasures magnified by the romantic tales which must have been spread about them would carry into every town and village an antidote for the terrors of conscription and would rouze men like the dreams imported from the new world when the first discoverers and adventurers returned with their ingots and their gold dust their stories and their promises to inflame and madden the avarice of the old <\s>
<s> what an effect says the governor of cadiz must it have upon the people he means the spanish people to know that a single soldier was carrying away 2580 livres tournois <\s>
<s> what an effect he might have said also must it have upon the french i direct the reader's attention to this because it seems to have been overlooked and because some of the public journals speaking of the convention and no doubt uttering the sentiments of several of their readers say that they are disgusted with the transaction not because the french have been permitted to carry off a few diamonds or some ingots of silver but because we confessed by consenting to the treaty that an army of 35,000 british troops aided by the portugueze nation was not able to compel 20,000 french to surrender at discretion <\s>
<s> this is indeed the root of the evil as hath been shewn and it is the curse of this treaty that the several parts of it are of such enormity as singly to occupy the attention and to destroy comparison and coexistence <\s>
<s> but the people of great britain are disgusted both with the one and the other <\s>
<s> they bewail the violation of the principle if the value of the things carried off had been in itself trifling their grief and their indignation would have been scarcely less <\s>
<s> but it is manifest from what has been said that it was not trifling and that therefore upon that account as well as upon others this permission was no less impolitic than it was unjust and dishonourable <\s>
<s> in illustrating these articles of the armistice and convention by which the french were both expressly permitted and indirectly enabled to carry off their booty we have already seen that a concession was made which is still more enormous viz <\s>
<s> that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or resident there and all natives of portugal who have accepted situations under the french government c shall have their property of every kind guaranteed to them by the british army <\s>
<s> by articles 16th and 17th their persons are placed under the like protection <\s>
<s> the french article xvi shall be at liberty either to accompany the french army or to remain in portugal and the portugueze article xvii shall not be rendered accountable for their political conduct during the period of the occupation of the country by the french army they all are placed under the protection of the british commanders and shall sustain no injury in their property or persons <\s>
<s> i have animadverted heretofore upon the unprofessional eagerness of our generals to appear in the character of negotiators when the sword would have done them more service than the pen <\s>
<s> but if they had confined themselves to mere military regulations they might indeed with justice have been grievously censured as injudicious commanders whose notion of the honour of armies was of a low pitch and who had no conception of the peculiar nature of the service in which they were engaged but the censure must have stopped here <\s>
<s> whereas by these provisions they have shewn that they have never reflected upon the nature of military authority as contra distinguished from civil <\s>
<s> french example had so far dazzled and blinded them that the french army is suffered to denominate itself the french government and from the whole tenour of these instruments from the preamble and these articles especially it should seem that our generals fancied themselves and their army to be the british government <\s>
<s> for these regulations emanating from a mere military authority are purely civil but of such a kind that no power on earth could confer a right to establish them <\s>
<s> and this trampling upon the most sacred rights this sacrifice of the consciousness of a self preserving principle without which neither societies nor governments can exist is not made by our generals in relation to subjects of their own sovereign but to an independent nation our ally into whose territories we could not have entered but from its confidence in our friendship and good faith <\s>
<s> surely the persons who under the countenance of too high authority have talked so loudly of prejudging this question entirely overlooked or utterly forgot this part of it <\s>
<s> what have these monstrous provisions to do with the relative strength of the two armies or with any point admitting a doubt <\s>
<s> what need here of a court of judicature to settle who were the persons their names are subscribed by their own hands and to determine the quality of the thing <\s>
<s> actions and agents like these exhibited in this connection with each other must of necessity be condemned the moment they are known and to assert the contrary is to maintain that man is a being without understanding and that morality is an empty dream <\s>
<s> and if this condemnation must after this manner follow to utter it is less a duty than a further inevitable consequence from the constitution of human nature <\s>
<s> they who hold that the formal sanction of a court of judicature is in this case required before a people has a right to pass sentence know not to what degree they are enemies to that people and to mankind to what degree selfishness whether arising from their peculiar situation or from other causes has in them prevailed over those faculties which are our common inheritance and cut them off from fellowship with the species <\s>
<s> most deplorable would be the result if it were possible that the injunctions of these men could be obeyed or their remonstrances acknowledged to be just <\s>
<s> for not to mention that if it were not for such prompt decisions of the public voice misdemeanours of men high in office would rarely be accounted for at all we must bear in mind at this crisis that the adversary of all good is hourly and daily extending his ravages and according to such notions of fitness our indignation our sorrow our shame our sense of right and wrong and all those moral affections and powers of the understanding by which alone he can be effectually opposed are to enter upon a long vacation their motion is to be suspended a thing impossible if it could it would be destroyed <\s>
<s> let us now see what language the portugueze speak upon that part of the treaty which has incited me to give vent to these feelings and to assert these truths <\s>
<s> i protest says general friere against article xvii one of the two now under examination because it attempts to tie down the government of this kingdom not to bring to justice and condign punishment those persons who have been notoriously and scandalously disloyal to their prince and the country by joining and serving the french party and even if the english army should be allowed to screen them from the punishment they have deserved still it should not prevent their expulsion whereby this country would no longer have to fear being again betrayed by the same men <\s>
<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>
<s> couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange <\s>
<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>
<s> which amounts to this <\s>
<s> the french are called upon formally to relinquish in favour of the portugueze that to which they never had any right to abandon false claims which they either had a power to enforce or they had not if they departed immediately and had not power the article was nugatory if they remained a day longer and had power there was no security that they would abide by it <\s>
<s> accordingly loud complaints were made that after the date of the convention all kinds of ravages were committed by the french upon lisbon and its neighbourhood and what did it matter whether these were upon the plea of old debts and requisitions or new debts were created more greedily than ever from the consciousness that the time for collecting them was so short <\s>
<s> this article then the only one which is even in shew favourable to the portugueze is in substance nothing inasmuch as in what it is silent upon viz <\s>
<s> that the people of lisbon and its neighbourhood shall not be vexed and oppressed by the french during their stay with new claims and robberies it is grossly cruel or negligent and in that for which it actually stipulates wholly delusive <\s>

<s> yet from the place which this specious article occupies preceding immediately the 16th and 17th which we have been last considering it is clear that it must have been intended by the french general as honey smeared upon the edge of the cup to make the poison contained in those two more palateable <\s>

<s> let us now see what language the portugueze speak upon that part of the treaty which has incited me to give vent to these feelings and to assert these truths <\s>
<s> i protest says general friere against article xvii one of the two now under examination because it attempts to tie down the government of this kingdom not to bring to justice and condign punishment those persons who have been notoriously and scandalously disloyal to their prince and the country by joining and serving the french party and even if the english army should be allowed to screen them from the punishment they have deserved still it should not prevent their expulsion whereby this country would no longer have to fear being again betrayed by the same men <\s>
<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>
<s> couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange <\s>
<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>
<s> which amounts to this <\s>
<s> the french are called upon formally to relinquish in favour of the portugueze that to which they never had any right to abandon false claims which they either had a power to enforce or they had not if they departed immediately and had not power the article was nugatory if they remained a day longer and had power there was no security that they would abide by it <\s>
<s> accordingly loud complaints were made that after the date of the convention all kinds of ravages were committed by the french upon lisbon and its neighbourhood and what did it matter whether these were upon the plea of old debts and requisitions or new debts were created more greedily than ever from the consciousness that the time for collecting them was so short <\s>
<s> this article then the only one which is even in shew favourable to the portugueze is in substance nothing inasmuch as in what it is silent upon viz <\s>
<s> that the people of lisbon and its neighbourhood shall not be vexed and oppressed by the french during their stay with new claims and robberies it is grossly cruel or negligent and in that for which it actually stipulates wholly delusive <\s>
<s> it is in fact insulting for the very admission of a formal renunciation of these claims does to a certain degree acknowledge their justice <\s>
<s> the only decent manner of introducing matter to this effect would have been by placing it as a bye clause of a provision that secured the portugueze from further molestations and merely alluding to it as a thing understood of course <\s>
<s> yet from the place which this specious article occupies preceding immediately the 16th and 17th which we have been last considering it is clear that it must have been intended by the french general as honey smeared upon the edge of the cup to make the poison contained in those two more palateable <\s>
<s> thus much for the portugueze and their particular interests <\s>
<s> in one instance a concern of the spanish nation comes directly under notice and that nation also is treated without delicacy or feeling <\s>
<s> for by the 18th article it is agreed that the spaniards 4000 in number who had been disarmed and were confined on ship board in the port of lisbon by the french should be liberated <\s>
<s> and upon what consideration <\s>
<s> not upon their right to be free as having been treacherously and cruelly dealt with by men who were part of a power that was labouring to subjugate their country and in this attempt had committed inhuman crimes against it not even exchanged as soldiers against soldiers but the condition of their emancipation is that the british general engages to obtain of the spaniards to restore such french subjects either military or civil as have been detained in spain without having been taken in battle or in consequence of military operations but on account of the occurrences of the 29th of last may and the days immediately following <\s>
<s> i know not what are exactly the features of the face for which this word serves as a veil i have no register at hand to inform me what these events precisely were but there can be no doubt that it was a time of triumph for liberty and humanity and that the persons for whom these noble minded spaniards were to be exchanged were no other than a horde from among the most abject of the french nation probably those wretches who having never faced either the dangers or the fatigues of war had been most busy in secret preparations or were most conspicuous in open acts of massacre when the streets of madrid a few weeks before had been drenched with the blood of two thousand of her bravest citizens <\s>
<s> yet the liberation of these spaniards upon these terms is recorded in the report of the court of enquiry as one of the advantages which in the contemplation of the generals would result from the convention <\s>
<s> finally if there shall be any doubt article xiv as to the meaning of any article it shall be explained favourably to the french army and hostages article xx of the rank of field officers on the part of the british army and navy shall be furnished for the guarantee of the present convention <\s>
<s> i have now gone through the painful task of examining the most material conditions of the convention of cintra the whole number of the articles is twenty two with three additional ones a long ladder into a deep abyss of infamy need it be said that neglects injuries and insults like these which we have been contemplating come from what quarter they may let them be exhibited towards whom they will must produce not merely mistrust and jealousy but alienation and hatred <\s>
<s> the passions and feelings may be quieted or diverted for a short time but though out of sight or seemingly asleep they must exist and the life which they have received cannot but by a long course of justice and kindness be overcome and destroyed <\s>
<s> but why talk of a long course of justice and kindness when the immediate result must have been so deplorable <\s>
<s> relying upon our humanity our fellow feeling and our justice upon these instant and urgent claims sanctioned by the more mild one of ancient alliance the portugueze people by voices from every part of their land entreated our succour the arrival of a british army upon their coasts was joyfully hailed and the people of the country zealously assisted in landing the troops without which help as a british general has informed us that landing could not have been effected <\s>
<s> and it is in this manner that they are repaid <\s>
<s> to some port between rochefort and l'orient and be at liberty to serve i come to that memorable condition article v that the french army shall carry with it all its equipments that is to say its military chests and carriages attached to the field commissariat and field hospitals or shall be allowed to dispose of such part as the commander in chief may judge it unnecessary to embark <\s>
<s> in like manner all individuals of the army shall be at liberty to dispose of their private property of every description with full security hereafter for the purchasers <\s>
<s> this is expressed still more pointedly in the armistice though the meaning implied in the two articles is precisely the same <\s>
<s> for in the fifth article of the armistice it is agreed provisionally that all those of whom the french army consists shall be conveyed to france with arms and baggage and all their private property of every description no part of which shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> in the convention it is only expressed that they shall be at liberty to depart article ii with arms and baggage and article v to dispose of their private property of every description <\s>
<s> but if they had a right to dispose of it this would include a right to carry it away which was undoubtedly understood by the french general <\s>
<s> and in the armistice it is expressly said that their private property of every description shall be conveyed to france along with their persons <\s>
<s> what then are we to understand by the words their private property of every description <\s>
<s> equipments of the army in general and baggage of individuals had been stipulated for before now we all know that the lawful professional gains and earnings of a soldier must be small that he is not in the habit of carrying about him during actual warfare any accumulation of these or other property and that the ordinary private property which he can be supposed to have a just title to is included under the name of his baggage therefore this was something more and what it was is apparent <\s>
<s> no part of their property says the armistice shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> who does not see in these words the consciousness of guilt an indirect self betraying admission that they had in their hands treasures which might be lawfully taken from them and an anxiety to prevent that act of justice by a positive stipulation <\s>
<s> who does not see on what sort of property the frenchman had his eye that it was not property by right but their possessions their plunder every thing by what means soever acquired that the french army or any individual in it was possessed of <\s>
<s> but it has been urged that the monstrousness of such a supposition precludes this interpretation renders it impossible that it could either be intended by the one party or so understood by the other <\s>
<s> what right they who signed and he who ratified this convention have to shelter themselves under this plea will appear from the 16th and 17th articles <\s>
<s> in these it is stipulated that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or accidentally in the country shall have their property of every kind moveable and immoveable guaranteed to them with liberty of retaining or disposing of it and passing the produce into france the same is stipulated article xvii for such natives of portugal as have sided with the french or occupied situations under the french government <\s>
<s> here then is a direct avowal still more monstrous that every frenchman or native of a country in alliance with france however obnoxious his crimes may have made him and every traitorous portugueze shall have his property guaranteed to him both previously to and after the reinstatement of the portugueze government by the british army <\s>
<s> now let us ask what sense the word property must have had fastened to it in these cases <\s>
<s> must it not necessarily have included all the rewards which the frenchman had received for his iniquity and the traitorous portugueze for his treason <\s>
<s> for no man would bear a part in such oppressions or would be a traitor for nothing and moreover all the rewards which the french could bestow must have been taken from the portugueze extorted from the honest and loyal to be given to the wicked and disloyal these rewards of iniquity must necessarily have been included for on our side no attempt is made at a distinction and on the side of the french the word immoveable is manifestly intended to preclude such a distinction where alone it could have been effectual <\s>
<s> property then here means possessions thus infamously acquired and in the instance of the portugueze the fundamental notion of the word is subverted for a traitor can have no property till the government of his own country has remitted the punishment due to his crimes <\s>
<s> and these wages of guilt which the master by such exactions was enabled to pay and which the servant thus earned are to be guaranteed to him by a british army <\s>
<s> where does there exist a power on earth that could confer this right <\s>
<s> if the portugueze government itself had acted in this manner it would have been guilty of wilful suicide and the nation if it had acted so of high treason against itself <\s>
<s> let it not then be said that the monstrousness of covenanting to convey along with the persons of the french their plunder secures the article from the interpretation which the people of great britain gave and which i have now proved they were bound to give to it but conceding for a moment that it was not intended that the words should bear this sense and that neither in a fair grammatical construction nor as illustrated by other passages or by the general tenour of the document they actually did bear it had not unquestionable voices proclaimed the cruelty and rapacity the acts of sacrilege assassination and robbery by which these treasures had been amassed <\s>
<s> was not the perfidy of the french army and its contempt of moral obligation both as a body and as to the individuals which composed it infamous through europe therefore the concession would signify nothing for our generals by allowing an army of this character to depart with its equipments waggons military chest and baggage had provided abundant means to enable it to carry off whatsoever it desired and thus to elude and frustrate any stipulations which might have been made for compelling it to restore that which had been so iniquitously seized <\s>
<s> and here are we brought back to the fountain head of all this baseness to that apathy and deadness to the principle of justice through the influence of which this army outlawed by its crimes was suffered to depart from the land over which it had so long tyrannized other than as a band of disarmed prisoners i maintain therefore that permission to carry off the booty was distinctly expressed and if it had not been so that the principle of justice could not here be preserved as a violation of it must necessarily have followed from other conditions of the treaty <\s>
<s> sir hew dalrymple himself before the court of inquiry has told us in two letters to generals beresford and friere that such part of the plunder as was in money it would be difficult if not impossible to identify and consequently the french could not be prevented from carrying it away with them <\s>
<s> from the same letters we learn that the french were intending to carry off a considerable part of their plunder by calling it public money and saying that it belonged to the military chest and that their evasions of the article were most shameful and evinced a want of probity and honour which was most disgraceful to them <\s>
<s> if the french had given no other proofs of their want of such virtues than those furnished by this occasion neither the portugueze nor spanish nor british nations would condemn them nor hate them as they now do; nor would this article of the convention have excited such indignation <\s>
<s> for the french by so acting could not deem themselves breaking an engagement no doubt they looked upon themselves as injured that the failure in good faith was on the part of the british and that it was in the lawlessness of power and by a mere quibble that this construction was afterwards put upon the article in question <\s>

<s> was not the perfidy of the french army and its contempt of moral obligation both as a body and as to the individuals which composed it infamous through europe therefore the concession would signify nothing for our generals by allowing an army of this character to depart with its equipments waggons military chest and baggage had provided abundant means to enable it to carry off whatsoever it desired and thus to elude and frustrate any stipulations which might have been made for compelling it to restore that which had been so iniquitously seized <\s>
<s> and here are we brought back to the fountain head of all this baseness to that apathy and deadness to the principle of justice through the influence of which this army outlawed by its crimes was suffered to depart from the land over which it had so long tyrannized other than as a band of disarmed prisoners i maintain therefore that permission to carry off the booty was distinctly expressed and if it had not been so that the principle of justice could not here be preserved as a violation of it must necessarily have followed from other conditions of the treaty <\s>
<s> sir hew dalrymple himself before the court of inquiry has told us in two letters to generals beresford and friere that such part of the plunder as was in money it would be difficult if not impossible to identify and consequently the french could not be prevented from carrying it away with them <\s>
<s> from the same letters we learn that the french were intending to carry off a considerable part of their plunder by calling it public money and saying that it belonged to the military chest and that their evasions of the article were most shameful and evinced a want of probity and honour which was most disgraceful to them <\s>
<s> if the french had given no other proofs of their want of such virtues than those furnished by this occasion neither the portugueze nor spanish nor british nations would condemn them nor hate them as they now do; nor would this article of the convention have excited such indignation <\s>
<s> for the french by so acting could not deem themselves breaking an engagement no doubt they looked upon themselves as injured that the failure in good faith was on the part of the british and that it was in the lawlessness of power and by a mere quibble that this construction was afterwards put upon the article in question <\s>
<s> widely different from the conduct of the british was that of the spaniards in a like case with high feeling did they abating not a jot or a tittle enforce the principle of justice <\s>
<s> how says the governor of cadiz to general dupont in the same noble letter before alluded to how says he after enumerating the afflictions which his army and the tyrant who had sent it had unjustly brought upon the spanish nation for of these in their dealings with the french they never for a moment lost sight how asks he could you expect that your army should carry off from spain the fruit of its rapacity cruelty and impiety <\s>
<s> how could you conceive this possible or that we should be so stupid or senseless <\s>
<s> and this conduct is as wise in reason as it is true to nature <\s>
<s> the spanish people could have had no confidence in their government if it had not acted thus <\s>
<s> these are the sympathies which prove that a government is paternal that it makes one family with the people besides it is only by such adherence to justice that in times of like commotion popular excesses can either be mitigated or prevented <\s>
<s> if we would be efficient allies of spain nay if we would not run the risk of doing infinite harm these sentiments must not only be ours as a nation but they must pervade the hearts of our ministers and our generals our agents and our ambassadors <\s>
<s> if it be not so they who are sent abroad must either be conscious how unworthy they are and with what unworthy commissions they appear or not if they do feel this then they must hang their heads and blush for their country and themselves if they do not the spaniards must blush for them and revolt from them or what would be ten thousand times more deplorable they must purchase a reconcilement and a communion by a sacrifice of all that is excellent in themselves <\s>
<s> spain must either break down her lofty spirit her animation and fiery courage to run side by side in the same trammels with great britain or she must start off from her intended yoke fellow with contempt and aversion <\s>
<s> this is the alternative and there is no avoiding it <\s>
<s> i have yet to speak of the influence of such concessions upon the french ruler and his army <\s>
<s> with what satanic pride must he have contemplated the devotion of his servants and adherents to their law the steadiness and zeal of their perverse loyalty and the faithfulness with which they stand by him and each other <\s>
<s> how must his heart have distended with false glory while he contrasted these qualities of his subjects with the insensibility and slackness of his british enemies <\s>
<s> this notice has however no especial propriety in this place for as far as concerns bonaparte his pride and depraved confidence may be equally fed by almost all the conditions of this instrument <\s>
<s> but as to his army it is plain that the permission whether it be considered as by an express article formally granted or only involved in the general conditions of the treaty to bear away in triumph the harvest of its crimes must not only have emboldened and exalted it with arrogance and whetted its rapacity but that hereby every soldier of which this army was composed must upon his arrival in his own country have been a seed which would give back plenteously in its kind <\s>
<s> the french are at present a needy people without commerce or manufactures unsettled in their minds and debased in their morals by revolutionary practices and habits of warfare and the youth of the country are rendered desperate by oppression which leaving no choice in their occupation discharges them from all responsibility to their own consciences <\s>
<s> how powerful then must have been the action of such incitements upon a people so circumstanced <\s>
<s> the actual sight and far more the imaginary sight and handling of these treasures magnified by the romantic tales which must have been spread about them would carry into every town and village an antidote for the terrors of conscription and would rouze men like the dreams imported from the new world when the first discoverers and adventurers returned with their ingots and their gold dust their stories and their promises to inflame and madden the avarice of the old <\s>
<s> what an effect says the governor of cadiz must it have upon the people he means the spanish people to know that a single soldier was carrying away 2580 livres tournois <\s>
<s> what an effect he might have said also must it have upon the french i direct the reader's attention to this because it seems to have been overlooked and because some of the public journals speaking of the convention and no doubt uttering the sentiments of several of their readers say that they are disgusted with the transaction not because the french have been permitted to carry off a few diamonds or some ingots of silver but because we confessed by consenting to the treaty that an army of 35,000 british troops aided by the portugueze nation was not able to compel 20,000 french to surrender at discretion <\s>
<s> this is indeed the root of the evil as hath been shewn and it is the curse of this treaty that the several parts of it are of such enormity as singly to occupy the attention and to destroy comparison and coexistence <\s>
<s> but the people of great britain are disgusted both with the one and the other <\s>
<s> they bewail the violation of the principle if the value of the things carried off had been in itself trifling their grief and their indignation would have been scarcely less <\s>
<s> but it is manifest from what has been said that it was not trifling and that therefore upon that account as well as upon others this permission was no less impolitic than it was unjust and dishonourable <\s>
<s> in illustrating these articles of the armistice and convention by which the french were both expressly permitted and indirectly enabled to carry off their booty we have already seen that a concession was made which is still more enormous viz <\s>
<s> that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or resident there and all natives of portugal who have accepted situations under the french government c shall have their property of every kind guaranteed to them by the british army <\s>
<s> by articles 16th and 17th their persons are placed under the like protection <\s>
<s> the french article xvi shall be at liberty either to accompany the french army or to remain in portugal and the portugueze article xvii shall not be rendered accountable for their political conduct during the period of the occupation of the country by the french army they all are placed under the protection of the british commanders and shall sustain no injury in their property or persons <\s>
<s> i have animadverted heretofore upon the unprofessional eagerness of our generals to appear in the character of negotiators when the sword would have done them more service than the pen <\s>
<s> but if they had confined themselves to mere military regulations they might indeed with justice have been grievously censured as injudicious commanders whose notion of the honour of armies was of a low pitch and who had no conception of the peculiar nature of the service in which they were engaged but the censure must have stopped here <\s>
<s> whereas by these provisions they have shewn that they have never reflected upon the nature of military authority as contra distinguished from civil <\s>
<s> french example had so far dazzled and blinded them that the french army is suffered to denominate itself the french government and from the whole tenour of these instruments from the preamble and these articles especially it should seem that our generals fancied themselves and their army to be the british government <\s>
<s> for these regulations emanating from a mere military authority are purely civil but of such a kind that no power on earth could confer a right to establish them <\s>
<s> and this trampling upon the most sacred rights this sacrifice of the consciousness of a self preserving principle without which neither societies nor governments can exist is not made by our generals in relation to subjects of their own sovereign but to an independent nation our ally into whose territories we could not have entered but from its confidence in our friendship and good faith <\s>
<s> surely the persons who under the countenance of too high authority have talked so loudly of prejudging this question entirely overlooked or utterly forgot this part of it <\s>
<s> what have these monstrous provisions to do with the relative strength of the two armies or with any point admitting a doubt <\s>
<s> what need here of a court of judicature to settle who were the persons their names are subscribed by their own hands and to determine the quality of the thing <\s>
<s> actions and agents like these exhibited in this connection with each other must of necessity be condemned the moment they are known and to assert the contrary is to maintain that man is a being without understanding and that morality is an empty dream <\s>
<s> and if this condemnation must after this manner follow to utter it is less a duty than a further inevitable consequence from the constitution of human nature <\s>
<s> they who hold that the formal sanction of a court of judicature is in this case required before a people has a right to pass sentence know not to what degree they are enemies to that people and to mankind to what degree selfishness whether arising from their peculiar situation or from other causes has in them prevailed over those faculties which are our common inheritance and cut them off from fellowship with the species <\s>
<s> most deplorable would be the result if it were possible that the injunctions of these men could be obeyed or their remonstrances acknowledged to be just <\s>
<s> for not to mention that if it were not for such prompt decisions of the public voice misdemeanours of men high in office would rarely be accounted for at all we must bear in mind at this crisis that the adversary of all good is hourly and daily extending his ravages and according to such notions of fitness our indignation our sorrow our shame our sense of right and wrong and all those moral affections and powers of the understanding by which alone he can be effectually opposed are to enter upon a long vacation their motion is to be suspended a thing impossible if it could it would be destroyed <\s>
<s> let us now see what language the portugueze speak upon that part of the treaty which has incited me to give vent to these feelings and to assert these truths <\s>
<s> i protest says general friere against article xvii one of the two now under examination because it attempts to tie down the government of this kingdom not to bring to justice and condign punishment those persons who have been notoriously and scandalously disloyal to their prince and the country by joining and serving the french party and even if the english army should be allowed to screen them from the punishment they have deserved still it should not prevent their expulsion whereby this country would no longer have to fear being again betrayed by the same men <\s>
<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>
<s> couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange <\s>
<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>

<s> let us now see what language the portugueze speak upon that part of the treaty which has incited me to give vent to these feelings and to assert these truths <\s>
<s> i protest says general friere against article xvii one of the two now under examination because it attempts to tie down the government of this kingdom not to bring to justice and condign punishment those persons who have been notoriously and scandalously disloyal to their prince and the country by joining and serving the french party and even if the english army should be allowed to screen them from the punishment they have deserved still it should not prevent their expulsion whereby this country would no longer have to fear being again betrayed by the same men <\s>
<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>
<s> couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange <\s>
<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>
<s> which amounts to this <\s>
<s> the french are called upon formally to relinquish in favour of the portugueze that to which they never had any right to abandon false claims which they either had a power to enforce or they had not if they departed immediately and had not power the article was nugatory if they remained a day longer and had power there was no security that they would abide by it <\s>
<s> accordingly loud complaints were made that after the date of the convention all kinds of ravages were committed by the french upon lisbon and its neighbourhood and what did it matter whether these were upon the plea of old debts and requisitions or new debts were created more greedily than ever from the consciousness that the time for collecting them was so short <\s>
<s> this article then the only one which is even in shew favourable to the portugueze is in substance nothing inasmuch as in what it is silent upon viz <\s>
<s> that the people of lisbon and its neighbourhood shall not be vexed and oppressed by the french during their stay with new claims and robberies it is grossly cruel or negligent and in that for which it actually stipulates wholly delusive <\s>
<s> it is in fact insulting for the very admission of a formal renunciation of these claims does to a certain degree acknowledge their justice <\s>
<s> the only decent manner of introducing matter to this effect would have been by placing it as a bye clause of a provision that secured the portugueze from further molestations and merely alluding to it as a thing understood of course <\s>
<s> yet from the place which this specious article occupies preceding immediately the 16th and 17th which we have been last considering it is clear that it must have been intended by the french general as honey smeared upon the edge of the cup to make the poison contained in those two more palateable <\s>
<s> thus much for the portugueze and their particular interests <\s>
<s> in one instance a concern of the spanish nation comes directly under notice and that nation also is treated without delicacy or feeling <\s>
<s> for by the 18th article it is agreed that the spaniards 4000 in number who had been disarmed and were confined on ship board in the port of lisbon by the french should be liberated <\s>
<s> and upon what consideration <\s>
<s> not upon their right to be free as having been treacherously and cruelly dealt with by men who were part of a power that was labouring to subjugate their country and in this attempt had committed inhuman crimes against it not even exchanged as soldiers against soldiers but the condition of their emancipation is that the british general engages to obtain of the spaniards to restore such french subjects either military or civil as have been detained in spain without having been taken in battle or in consequence of military operations but on account of the occurrences of the 29th of last may and the days immediately following <\s>
<s> i know not what are exactly the features of the face for which this word serves as a veil i have no register at hand to inform me what these events precisely were but there can be no doubt that it was a time of triumph for liberty and humanity and that the persons for whom these noble minded spaniards were to be exchanged were no other than a horde from among the most abject of the french nation probably those wretches who having never faced either the dangers or the fatigues of war had been most busy in secret preparations or were most conspicuous in open acts of massacre when the streets of madrid a few weeks before had been drenched with the blood of two thousand of her bravest citizens <\s>
<s> yet the liberation of these spaniards upon these terms is recorded in the report of the court of enquiry as one of the advantages which in the contemplation of the generals would result from the convention <\s>
<s> finally if there shall be any doubt article xiv as to the meaning of any article it shall be explained favourably to the french army and hostages article xx of the rank of field officers on the part of the british army and navy shall be furnished for the guarantee of the present convention <\s>
<s> i have now gone through the painful task of examining the most material conditions of the convention of cintra the whole number of the articles is twenty two with three additional ones a long ladder into a deep abyss of infamy need it be said that neglects injuries and insults like these which we have been contemplating come from what quarter they may let them be exhibited towards whom they will must produce not merely mistrust and jealousy but alienation and hatred <\s>
<s> the passions and feelings may be quieted or diverted for a short time but though out of sight or seemingly asleep they must exist and the life which they have received cannot but by a long course of justice and kindness be overcome and destroyed <\s>
<s> but why talk of a long course of justice and kindness when the immediate result must have been so deplorable <\s>
<s> relying upon our humanity our fellow feeling and our justice upon these instant and urgent claims sanctioned by the more mild one of ancient alliance the portugueze people by voices from every part of their land entreated our succour the arrival of a british army upon their coasts was joyfully hailed and the people of the country zealously assisted in landing the troops without which help as a british general has informed us that landing could not have been effected <\s>
<s> and it is in this manner that they are repaid <\s>
<s> to some port between rochefort and l'orient and be at liberty to serve i come to that memorable condition article v that the french army shall carry with it all its equipments that is to say its military chests and carriages attached to the field commissariat and field hospitals or shall be allowed to dispose of such part as the commander in chief may judge it unnecessary to embark <\s>
<s> in like manner all individuals of the army shall be at liberty to dispose of their private property of every description with full security hereafter for the purchasers <\s>
<s> this is expressed still more pointedly in the armistice though the meaning implied in the two articles is precisely the same <\s>
<s> for in the fifth article of the armistice it is agreed provisionally that all those of whom the french army consists shall be conveyed to france with arms and baggage and all their private property of every description no part of which shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> in the convention it is only expressed that they shall be at liberty to depart article ii with arms and baggage and article v to dispose of their private property of every description <\s>
<s> but if they had a right to dispose of it this would include a right to carry it away which was undoubtedly understood by the french general <\s>
<s> and in the armistice it is expressly said that their private property of every description shall be conveyed to france along with their persons <\s>
<s> what then are we to understand by the words their private property of every description <\s>
<s> equipments of the army in general and baggage of individuals had been stipulated for before now we all know that the lawful professional gains and earnings of a soldier must be small that he is not in the habit of carrying about him during actual warfare any accumulation of these or other property and that the ordinary private property which he can be supposed to have a just title to is included under the name of his baggage therefore this was something more and what it was is apparent <\s>
<s> no part of their property says the armistice shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> who does not see in these words the consciousness of guilt an indirect self betraying admission that they had in their hands treasures which might be lawfully taken from them and an anxiety to prevent that act of justice by a positive stipulation <\s>
<s> who does not see on what sort of property the frenchman had his eye that it was not property by right but their possessions their plunder every thing by what means soever acquired that the french army or any individual in it was possessed of <\s>
<s> but it has been urged that the monstrousness of such a supposition precludes this interpretation renders it impossible that it could either be intended by the one party or so understood by the other <\s>
<s> what right they who signed and he who ratified this convention have to shelter themselves under this plea will appear from the 16th and 17th articles <\s>
<s> in these it is stipulated that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or accidentally in the country shall have their property of every kind moveable and immoveable guaranteed to them with liberty of retaining or disposing of it and passing the produce into france the same is stipulated article xvii for such natives of portugal as have sided with the french or occupied situations under the french government <\s>
<s> here then is a direct avowal still more monstrous that every frenchman or native of a country in alliance with france however obnoxious his crimes may have made him and every traitorous portugueze shall have his property guaranteed to him both previously to and after the reinstatement of the portugueze government by the british army <\s>
<s> now let us ask what sense the word property must have had fastened to it in these cases <\s>
<s> must it not necessarily have included all the rewards which the frenchman had received for his iniquity and the traitorous portugueze for his treason <\s>
<s> for no man would bear a part in such oppressions or would be a traitor for nothing and moreover all the rewards which the french could bestow must have been taken from the portugueze extorted from the honest and loyal to be given to the wicked and disloyal these rewards of iniquity must necessarily have been included for on our side no attempt is made at a distinction and on the side of the french the word immoveable is manifestly intended to preclude such a distinction where alone it could have been effectual <\s>
<s> property then here means possessions thus infamously acquired and in the instance of the portugueze the fundamental notion of the word is subverted for a traitor can have no property till the government of his own country has remitted the punishment due to his crimes <\s>
<s> and these wages of guilt which the master by such exactions was enabled to pay and which the servant thus earned are to be guaranteed to him by a british army <\s>
<s> where does there exist a power on earth that could confer this right <\s>
<s> if the portugueze government itself had acted in this manner it would have been guilty of wilful suicide and the nation if it had acted so of high treason against itself <\s>
<s> let it not then be said that the monstrousness of covenanting to convey along with the persons of the french their plunder secures the article from the interpretation which the people of great britain gave and which i have now proved they were bound to give to it but conceding for a moment that it was not intended that the words should bear this sense and that neither in a fair grammatical construction nor as illustrated by other passages or by the general tenour of the document they actually did bear it had not unquestionable voices proclaimed the cruelty and rapacity the acts of sacrilege assassination and robbery by which these treasures had been amassed <\s>
<s> was not the perfidy of the french army and its contempt of moral obligation both as a body and as to the individuals which composed it infamous through europe therefore the concession would signify nothing for our generals by allowing an army of this character to depart with its equipments waggons military chest and baggage had provided abundant means to enable it to carry off whatsoever it desired and thus to elude and frustrate any stipulations which might have been made for compelling it to restore that which had been so iniquitously seized <\s>

<s> what right they who signed and he who ratified this convention have to shelter themselves under this plea will appear from the 16th and 17th articles <\s>
<s> in these it is stipulated that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or accidentally in the country shall have their property of every kind moveable and immoveable guaranteed to them with liberty of retaining or disposing of it and passing the produce into france the same is stipulated article xvii for such natives of portugal as have sided with the french or occupied situations under the french government <\s>
<s> here then is a direct avowal still more monstrous that every frenchman or native of a country in alliance with france however obnoxious his crimes may have made him and every traitorous portugueze shall have his property guaranteed to him both previously to and after the reinstatement of the portugueze government by the british army <\s>
<s> now let us ask what sense the word property must have had fastened to it in these cases <\s>
<s> must it not necessarily have included all the rewards which the frenchman had received for his iniquity and the traitorous portugueze for his treason <\s>
<s> for no man would bear a part in such oppressions or would be a traitor for nothing and moreover all the rewards which the french could bestow must have been taken from the portugueze extorted from the honest and loyal to be given to the wicked and disloyal these rewards of iniquity must necessarily have been included for on our side no attempt is made at a distinction and on the side of the french the word immoveable is manifestly intended to preclude such a distinction where alone it could have been effectual <\s>
<s> property then here means possessions thus infamously acquired and in the instance of the portugueze the fundamental notion of the word is subverted for a traitor can have no property till the government of his own country has remitted the punishment due to his crimes <\s>
<s> and these wages of guilt which the master by such exactions was enabled to pay and which the servant thus earned are to be guaranteed to him by a british army <\s>
<s> where does there exist a power on earth that could confer this right <\s>
<s> if the portugueze government itself had acted in this manner it would have been guilty of wilful suicide and the nation if it had acted so of high treason against itself <\s>
<s> let it not then be said that the monstrousness of covenanting to convey along with the persons of the french their plunder secures the article from the interpretation which the people of great britain gave and which i have now proved they were bound to give to it but conceding for a moment that it was not intended that the words should bear this sense and that neither in a fair grammatical construction nor as illustrated by other passages or by the general tenour of the document they actually did bear it had not unquestionable voices proclaimed the cruelty and rapacity the acts of sacrilege assassination and robbery by which these treasures had been amassed <\s>
<s> was not the perfidy of the french army and its contempt of moral obligation both as a body and as to the individuals which composed it infamous through europe therefore the concession would signify nothing for our generals by allowing an army of this character to depart with its equipments waggons military chest and baggage had provided abundant means to enable it to carry off whatsoever it desired and thus to elude and frustrate any stipulations which might have been made for compelling it to restore that which had been so iniquitously seized <\s>
<s> and here are we brought back to the fountain head of all this baseness to that apathy and deadness to the principle of justice through the influence of which this army outlawed by its crimes was suffered to depart from the land over which it had so long tyrannized other than as a band of disarmed prisoners i maintain therefore that permission to carry off the booty was distinctly expressed and if it had not been so that the principle of justice could not here be preserved as a violation of it must necessarily have followed from other conditions of the treaty <\s>
<s> sir hew dalrymple himself before the court of inquiry has told us in two letters to generals beresford and friere that such part of the plunder as was in money it would be difficult if not impossible to identify and consequently the french could not be prevented from carrying it away with them <\s>
<s> from the same letters we learn that the french were intending to carry off a considerable part of their plunder by calling it public money and saying that it belonged to the military chest and that their evasions of the article were most shameful and evinced a want of probity and honour which was most disgraceful to them <\s>
<s> if the french had given no other proofs of their want of such virtues than those furnished by this occasion neither the portugueze nor spanish nor british nations would condemn them nor hate them as they now do; nor would this article of the convention have excited such indignation <\s>
<s> for the french by so acting could not deem themselves breaking an engagement no doubt they looked upon themselves as injured that the failure in good faith was on the part of the british and that it was in the lawlessness of power and by a mere quibble that this construction was afterwards put upon the article in question <\s>
<s> widely different from the conduct of the british was that of the spaniards in a like case with high feeling did they abating not a jot or a tittle enforce the principle of justice <\s>
<s> how says the governor of cadiz to general dupont in the same noble letter before alluded to how says he after enumerating the afflictions which his army and the tyrant who had sent it had unjustly brought upon the spanish nation for of these in their dealings with the french they never for a moment lost sight how asks he could you expect that your army should carry off from spain the fruit of its rapacity cruelty and impiety <\s>
<s> how could you conceive this possible or that we should be so stupid or senseless <\s>
<s> and this conduct is as wise in reason as it is true to nature <\s>
<s> the spanish people could have had no confidence in their government if it had not acted thus <\s>
<s> these are the sympathies which prove that a government is paternal that it makes one family with the people besides it is only by such adherence to justice that in times of like commotion popular excesses can either be mitigated or prevented <\s>
<s> if we would be efficient allies of spain nay if we would not run the risk of doing infinite harm these sentiments must not only be ours as a nation but they must pervade the hearts of our ministers and our generals our agents and our ambassadors <\s>
<s> if it be not so they who are sent abroad must either be conscious how unworthy they are and with what unworthy commissions they appear or not if they do feel this then they must hang their heads and blush for their country and themselves if they do not the spaniards must blush for them and revolt from them or what would be ten thousand times more deplorable they must purchase a reconcilement and a communion by a sacrifice of all that is excellent in themselves <\s>
<s> spain must either break down her lofty spirit her animation and fiery courage to run side by side in the same trammels with great britain or she must start off from her intended yoke fellow with contempt and aversion <\s>
<s> this is the alternative and there is no avoiding it <\s>
<s> i have yet to speak of the influence of such concessions upon the french ruler and his army <\s>
<s> with what satanic pride must he have contemplated the devotion of his servants and adherents to their law the steadiness and zeal of their perverse loyalty and the faithfulness with which they stand by him and each other <\s>
<s> how must his heart have distended with false glory while he contrasted these qualities of his subjects with the insensibility and slackness of his british enemies <\s>
<s> this notice has however no especial propriety in this place for as far as concerns bonaparte his pride and depraved confidence may be equally fed by almost all the conditions of this instrument <\s>
<s> but as to his army it is plain that the permission whether it be considered as by an express article formally granted or only involved in the general conditions of the treaty to bear away in triumph the harvest of its crimes must not only have emboldened and exalted it with arrogance and whetted its rapacity but that hereby every soldier of which this army was composed must upon his arrival in his own country have been a seed which would give back plenteously in its kind <\s>
<s> the french are at present a needy people without commerce or manufactures unsettled in their minds and debased in their morals by revolutionary practices and habits of warfare and the youth of the country are rendered desperate by oppression which leaving no choice in their occupation discharges them from all responsibility to their own consciences <\s>
<s> how powerful then must have been the action of such incitements upon a people so circumstanced <\s>
<s> the actual sight and far more the imaginary sight and handling of these treasures magnified by the romantic tales which must have been spread about them would carry into every town and village an antidote for the terrors of conscription and would rouze men like the dreams imported from the new world when the first discoverers and adventurers returned with their ingots and their gold dust their stories and their promises to inflame and madden the avarice of the old <\s>
<s> what an effect says the governor of cadiz must it have upon the people he means the spanish people to know that a single soldier was carrying away 2580 livres tournois <\s>
<s> what an effect he might have said also must it have upon the french i direct the reader's attention to this because it seems to have been overlooked and because some of the public journals speaking of the convention and no doubt uttering the sentiments of several of their readers say that they are disgusted with the transaction not because the french have been permitted to carry off a few diamonds or some ingots of silver but because we confessed by consenting to the treaty that an army of 35,000 british troops aided by the portugueze nation was not able to compel 20,000 french to surrender at discretion <\s>
<s> this is indeed the root of the evil as hath been shewn and it is the curse of this treaty that the several parts of it are of such enormity as singly to occupy the attention and to destroy comparison and coexistence <\s>
<s> but the people of great britain are disgusted both with the one and the other <\s>
<s> they bewail the violation of the principle if the value of the things carried off had been in itself trifling their grief and their indignation would have been scarcely less <\s>
<s> but it is manifest from what has been said that it was not trifling and that therefore upon that account as well as upon others this permission was no less impolitic than it was unjust and dishonourable <\s>
<s> in illustrating these articles of the armistice and convention by which the french were both expressly permitted and indirectly enabled to carry off their booty we have already seen that a concession was made which is still more enormous viz <\s>
<s> that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or resident there and all natives of portugal who have accepted situations under the french government c shall have their property of every kind guaranteed to them by the british army <\s>
<s> by articles 16th and 17th their persons are placed under the like protection <\s>
<s> the french article xvi shall be at liberty either to accompany the french army or to remain in portugal and the portugueze article xvii shall not be rendered accountable for their political conduct during the period of the occupation of the country by the french army they all are placed under the protection of the british commanders and shall sustain no injury in their property or persons <\s>
<s> i have animadverted heretofore upon the unprofessional eagerness of our generals to appear in the character of negotiators when the sword would have done them more service than the pen <\s>
<s> but if they had confined themselves to mere military regulations they might indeed with justice have been grievously censured as injudicious commanders whose notion of the honour of armies was of a low pitch and who had no conception of the peculiar nature of the service in which they were engaged but the censure must have stopped here <\s>
<s> whereas by these provisions they have shewn that they have never reflected upon the nature of military authority as contra distinguished from civil <\s>
<s> french example had so far dazzled and blinded them that the french army is suffered to denominate itself the french government and from the whole tenour of these instruments from the preamble and these articles especially it should seem that our generals fancied themselves and their army to be the british government <\s>
<s> for these regulations emanating from a mere military authority are purely civil but of such a kind that no power on earth could confer a right to establish them <\s>
<s> and this trampling upon the most sacred rights this sacrifice of the consciousness of a self preserving principle without which neither societies nor governments can exist is not made by our generals in relation to subjects of their own sovereign but to an independent nation our ally into whose territories we could not have entered but from its confidence in our friendship and good faith <\s>
<s> surely the persons who under the countenance of too high authority have talked so loudly of prejudging this question entirely overlooked or utterly forgot this part of it <\s>
<s> what have these monstrous provisions to do with the relative strength of the two armies or with any point admitting a doubt <\s>
<s> what need here of a court of judicature to settle who were the persons their names are subscribed by their own hands and to determine the quality of the thing <\s>
<s> actions and agents like these exhibited in this connection with each other must of necessity be condemned the moment they are known and to assert the contrary is to maintain that man is a being without understanding and that morality is an empty dream <\s>
<s> and if this condemnation must after this manner follow to utter it is less a duty than a further inevitable consequence from the constitution of human nature <\s>
<s> they who hold that the formal sanction of a court of judicature is in this case required before a people has a right to pass sentence know not to what degree they are enemies to that people and to mankind to what degree selfishness whether arising from their peculiar situation or from other causes has in them prevailed over those faculties which are our common inheritance and cut them off from fellowship with the species <\s>
<s> most deplorable would be the result if it were possible that the injunctions of these men could be obeyed or their remonstrances acknowledged to be just <\s>
<s> for not to mention that if it were not for such prompt decisions of the public voice misdemeanours of men high in office would rarely be accounted for at all we must bear in mind at this crisis that the adversary of all good is hourly and daily extending his ravages and according to such notions of fitness our indignation our sorrow our shame our sense of right and wrong and all those moral affections and powers of the understanding by which alone he can be effectually opposed are to enter upon a long vacation their motion is to be suspended a thing impossible if it could it would be destroyed <\s>

<s> and if this condemnation must after this manner follow to utter it is less a duty than a further inevitable consequence from the constitution of human nature <\s>
<s> they who hold that the formal sanction of a court of judicature is in this case required before a people has a right to pass sentence know not to what degree they are enemies to that people and to mankind to what degree selfishness whether arising from their peculiar situation or from other causes has in them prevailed over those faculties which are our common inheritance and cut them off from fellowship with the species <\s>
<s> most deplorable would be the result if it were possible that the injunctions of these men could be obeyed or their remonstrances acknowledged to be just <\s>
<s> for not to mention that if it were not for such prompt decisions of the public voice misdemeanours of men high in office would rarely be accounted for at all we must bear in mind at this crisis that the adversary of all good is hourly and daily extending his ravages and according to such notions of fitness our indignation our sorrow our shame our sense of right and wrong and all those moral affections and powers of the understanding by which alone he can be effectually opposed are to enter upon a long vacation their motion is to be suspended a thing impossible if it could it would be destroyed <\s>
<s> let us now see what language the portugueze speak upon that part of the treaty which has incited me to give vent to these feelings and to assert these truths <\s>
<s> i protest says general friere against article xvii one of the two now under examination because it attempts to tie down the government of this kingdom not to bring to justice and condign punishment those persons who have been notoriously and scandalously disloyal to their prince and the country by joining and serving the french party and even if the english army should be allowed to screen them from the punishment they have deserved still it should not prevent their expulsion whereby this country would no longer have to fear being again betrayed by the same men <\s>
<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>
<s> couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange <\s>
<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>
<s> which amounts to this <\s>
<s> the french are called upon formally to relinquish in favour of the portugueze that to which they never had any right to abandon false claims which they either had a power to enforce or they had not if they departed immediately and had not power the article was nugatory if they remained a day longer and had power there was no security that they would abide by it <\s>
<s> accordingly loud complaints were made that after the date of the convention all kinds of ravages were committed by the french upon lisbon and its neighbourhood and what did it matter whether these were upon the plea of old debts and requisitions or new debts were created more greedily than ever from the consciousness that the time for collecting them was so short <\s>
<s> this article then the only one which is even in shew favourable to the portugueze is in substance nothing inasmuch as in what it is silent upon viz <\s>
<s> that the people of lisbon and its neighbourhood shall not be vexed and oppressed by the french during their stay with new claims and robberies it is grossly cruel or negligent and in that for which it actually stipulates wholly delusive <\s>
<s> it is in fact insulting for the very admission of a formal renunciation of these claims does to a certain degree acknowledge their justice <\s>
<s> the only decent manner of introducing matter to this effect would have been by placing it as a bye clause of a provision that secured the portugueze from further molestations and merely alluding to it as a thing understood of course <\s>
<s> yet from the place which this specious article occupies preceding immediately the 16th and 17th which we have been last considering it is clear that it must have been intended by the french general as honey smeared upon the edge of the cup to make the poison contained in those two more palateable <\s>
<s> thus much for the portugueze and their particular interests <\s>
<s> in one instance a concern of the spanish nation comes directly under notice and that nation also is treated without delicacy or feeling <\s>
<s> for by the 18th article it is agreed that the spaniards 4000 in number who had been disarmed and were confined on ship board in the port of lisbon by the french should be liberated <\s>
<s> and upon what consideration <\s>
<s> not upon their right to be free as having been treacherously and cruelly dealt with by men who were part of a power that was labouring to subjugate their country and in this attempt had committed inhuman crimes against it not even exchanged as soldiers against soldiers but the condition of their emancipation is that the british general engages to obtain of the spaniards to restore such french subjects either military or civil as have been detained in spain without having been taken in battle or in consequence of military operations but on account of the occurrences of the 29th of last may and the days immediately following <\s>
<s> i know not what are exactly the features of the face for which this word serves as a veil i have no register at hand to inform me what these events precisely were but there can be no doubt that it was a time of triumph for liberty and humanity and that the persons for whom these noble minded spaniards were to be exchanged were no other than a horde from among the most abject of the french nation probably those wretches who having never faced either the dangers or the fatigues of war had been most busy in secret preparations or were most conspicuous in open acts of massacre when the streets of madrid a few weeks before had been drenched with the blood of two thousand of her bravest citizens <\s>
<s> yet the liberation of these spaniards upon these terms is recorded in the report of the court of enquiry as one of the advantages which in the contemplation of the generals would result from the convention <\s>
<s> finally if there shall be any doubt article xiv as to the meaning of any article it shall be explained favourably to the french army and hostages article xx of the rank of field officers on the part of the british army and navy shall be furnished for the guarantee of the present convention <\s>
<s> i have now gone through the painful task of examining the most material conditions of the convention of cintra the whole number of the articles is twenty two with three additional ones a long ladder into a deep abyss of infamy need it be said that neglects injuries and insults like these which we have been contemplating come from what quarter they may let them be exhibited towards whom they will must produce not merely mistrust and jealousy but alienation and hatred <\s>
<s> the passions and feelings may be quieted or diverted for a short time but though out of sight or seemingly asleep they must exist and the life which they have received cannot but by a long course of justice and kindness be overcome and destroyed <\s>
<s> but why talk of a long course of justice and kindness when the immediate result must have been so deplorable <\s>
<s> relying upon our humanity our fellow feeling and our justice upon these instant and urgent claims sanctioned by the more mild one of ancient alliance the portugueze people by voices from every part of their land entreated our succour the arrival of a british army upon their coasts was joyfully hailed and the people of the country zealously assisted in landing the troops without which help as a british general has informed us that landing could not have been effected <\s>
<s> and it is in this manner that they are repaid <\s>
<s> to some port between rochefort and l'orient and be at liberty to serve i come to that memorable condition article v that the french army shall carry with it all its equipments that is to say its military chests and carriages attached to the field commissariat and field hospitals or shall be allowed to dispose of such part as the commander in chief may judge it unnecessary to embark <\s>
<s> in like manner all individuals of the army shall be at liberty to dispose of their private property of every description with full security hereafter for the purchasers <\s>
<s> this is expressed still more pointedly in the armistice though the meaning implied in the two articles is precisely the same <\s>
<s> for in the fifth article of the armistice it is agreed provisionally that all those of whom the french army consists shall be conveyed to france with arms and baggage and all their private property of every description no part of which shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> in the convention it is only expressed that they shall be at liberty to depart article ii with arms and baggage and article v to dispose of their private property of every description <\s>
<s> but if they had a right to dispose of it this would include a right to carry it away which was undoubtedly understood by the french general <\s>
<s> and in the armistice it is expressly said that their private property of every description shall be conveyed to france along with their persons <\s>
<s> what then are we to understand by the words their private property of every description <\s>
<s> equipments of the army in general and baggage of individuals had been stipulated for before now we all know that the lawful professional gains and earnings of a soldier must be small that he is not in the habit of carrying about him during actual warfare any accumulation of these or other property and that the ordinary private property which he can be supposed to have a just title to is included under the name of his baggage therefore this was something more and what it was is apparent <\s>
<s> no part of their property says the armistice shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> who does not see in these words the consciousness of guilt an indirect self betraying admission that they had in their hands treasures which might be lawfully taken from them and an anxiety to prevent that act of justice by a positive stipulation <\s>
<s> who does not see on what sort of property the frenchman had his eye that it was not property by right but their possessions their plunder every thing by what means soever acquired that the french army or any individual in it was possessed of <\s>
<s> but it has been urged that the monstrousness of such a supposition precludes this interpretation renders it impossible that it could either be intended by the one party or so understood by the other <\s>
<s> what right they who signed and he who ratified this convention have to shelter themselves under this plea will appear from the 16th and 17th articles <\s>
<s> in these it is stipulated that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or accidentally in the country shall have their property of every kind moveable and immoveable guaranteed to them with liberty of retaining or disposing of it and passing the produce into france the same is stipulated article xvii for such natives of portugal as have sided with the french or occupied situations under the french government <\s>
<s> here then is a direct avowal still more monstrous that every frenchman or native of a country in alliance with france however obnoxious his crimes may have made him and every traitorous portugueze shall have his property guaranteed to him both previously to and after the reinstatement of the portugueze government by the british army <\s>
<s> now let us ask what sense the word property must have had fastened to it in these cases <\s>
<s> must it not necessarily have included all the rewards which the frenchman had received for his iniquity and the traitorous portugueze for his treason <\s>
<s> for no man would bear a part in such oppressions or would be a traitor for nothing and moreover all the rewards which the french could bestow must have been taken from the portugueze extorted from the honest and loyal to be given to the wicked and disloyal these rewards of iniquity must necessarily have been included for on our side no attempt is made at a distinction and on the side of the french the word immoveable is manifestly intended to preclude such a distinction where alone it could have been effectual <\s>
<s> property then here means possessions thus infamously acquired and in the instance of the portugueze the fundamental notion of the word is subverted for a traitor can have no property till the government of his own country has remitted the punishment due to his crimes <\s>
<s> and these wages of guilt which the master by such exactions was enabled to pay and which the servant thus earned are to be guaranteed to him by a british army <\s>
<s> where does there exist a power on earth that could confer this right <\s>
<s> if the portugueze government itself had acted in this manner it would have been guilty of wilful suicide and the nation if it had acted so of high treason against itself <\s>
<s> let it not then be said that the monstrousness of covenanting to convey along with the persons of the french their plunder secures the article from the interpretation which the people of great britain gave and which i have now proved they were bound to give to it but conceding for a moment that it was not intended that the words should bear this sense and that neither in a fair grammatical construction nor as illustrated by other passages or by the general tenour of the document they actually did bear it had not unquestionable voices proclaimed the cruelty and rapacity the acts of sacrilege assassination and robbery by which these treasures had been amassed <\s>

<s> equipments of the army in general and baggage of individuals had been stipulated for before now we all know that the lawful professional gains and earnings of a soldier must be small that he is not in the habit of carrying about him during actual warfare any accumulation of these or other property and that the ordinary private property which he can be supposed to have a just title to is included under the name of his baggage therefore this was something more and what it was is apparent <\s>
<s> no part of their property says the armistice shall be wrested from them <\s>
<s> who does not see in these words the consciousness of guilt an indirect self betraying admission that they had in their hands treasures which might be lawfully taken from them and an anxiety to prevent that act of justice by a positive stipulation <\s>

<s> but it has been urged that the monstrousness of such a supposition precludes this interpretation renders it impossible that it could either be intended by the one party or so understood by the other <\s>
<s> what right they who signed and he who ratified this convention have to shelter themselves under this plea will appear from the 16th and 17th articles <\s>
<s> in these it is stipulated that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or accidentally in the country shall have their property of every kind moveable and immoveable guaranteed to them with liberty of retaining or disposing of it and passing the produce into france the same is stipulated article xvii for such natives of portugal as have sided with the french or occupied situations under the french government <\s>
<s> here then is a direct avowal still more monstrous that every frenchman or native of a country in alliance with france however obnoxious his crimes may have made him and every traitorous portugueze shall have his property guaranteed to him both previously to and after the reinstatement of the portugueze government by the british army <\s>
<s> now let us ask what sense the word property must have had fastened to it in these cases <\s>
<s> must it not necessarily have included all the rewards which the frenchman had received for his iniquity and the traitorous portugueze for his treason <\s>
<s> for no man would bear a part in such oppressions or would be a traitor for nothing and moreover all the rewards which the french could bestow must have been taken from the portugueze extorted from the honest and loyal to be given to the wicked and disloyal these rewards of iniquity must necessarily have been included for on our side no attempt is made at a distinction and on the side of the french the word immoveable is manifestly intended to preclude such a distinction where alone it could have been effectual <\s>
<s> property then here means possessions thus infamously acquired and in the instance of the portugueze the fundamental notion of the word is subverted for a traitor can have no property till the government of his own country has remitted the punishment due to his crimes <\s>
<s> and these wages of guilt which the master by such exactions was enabled to pay and which the servant thus earned are to be guaranteed to him by a british army <\s>
<s> where does there exist a power on earth that could confer this right <\s>
<s> if the portugueze government itself had acted in this manner it would have been guilty of wilful suicide and the nation if it had acted so of high treason against itself <\s>
<s> let it not then be said that the monstrousness of covenanting to convey along with the persons of the french their plunder secures the article from the interpretation which the people of great britain gave and which i have now proved they were bound to give to it but conceding for a moment that it was not intended that the words should bear this sense and that neither in a fair grammatical construction nor as illustrated by other passages or by the general tenour of the document they actually did bear it had not unquestionable voices proclaimed the cruelty and rapacity the acts of sacrilege assassination and robbery by which these treasures had been amassed <\s>
<s> was not the perfidy of the french army and its contempt of moral obligation both as a body and as to the individuals which composed it infamous through europe therefore the concession would signify nothing for our generals by allowing an army of this character to depart with its equipments waggons military chest and baggage had provided abundant means to enable it to carry off whatsoever it desired and thus to elude and frustrate any stipulations which might have been made for compelling it to restore that which had been so iniquitously seized <\s>
<s> and here are we brought back to the fountain head of all this baseness to that apathy and deadness to the principle of justice through the influence of which this army outlawed by its crimes was suffered to depart from the land over which it had so long tyrannized other than as a band of disarmed prisoners i maintain therefore that permission to carry off the booty was distinctly expressed and if it had not been so that the principle of justice could not here be preserved as a violation of it must necessarily have followed from other conditions of the treaty <\s>
<s> sir hew dalrymple himself before the court of inquiry has told us in two letters to generals beresford and friere that such part of the plunder as was in money it would be difficult if not impossible to identify and consequently the french could not be prevented from carrying it away with them <\s>
<s> from the same letters we learn that the french were intending to carry off a considerable part of their plunder by calling it public money and saying that it belonged to the military chest and that their evasions of the article were most shameful and evinced a want of probity and honour which was most disgraceful to them <\s>
<s> if the french had given no other proofs of their want of such virtues than those furnished by this occasion neither the portugueze nor spanish nor british nations would condemn them nor hate them as they now do; nor would this article of the convention have excited such indignation <\s>
<s> for the french by so acting could not deem themselves breaking an engagement no doubt they looked upon themselves as injured that the failure in good faith was on the part of the british and that it was in the lawlessness of power and by a mere quibble that this construction was afterwards put upon the article in question <\s>
<s> widely different from the conduct of the british was that of the spaniards in a like case with high feeling did they abating not a jot or a tittle enforce the principle of justice <\s>
<s> how says the governor of cadiz to general dupont in the same noble letter before alluded to how says he after enumerating the afflictions which his army and the tyrant who had sent it had unjustly brought upon the spanish nation for of these in their dealings with the french they never for a moment lost sight how asks he could you expect that your army should carry off from spain the fruit of its rapacity cruelty and impiety <\s>
<s> how could you conceive this possible or that we should be so stupid or senseless <\s>
<s> and this conduct is as wise in reason as it is true to nature <\s>
<s> the spanish people could have had no confidence in their government if it had not acted thus <\s>
<s> these are the sympathies which prove that a government is paternal that it makes one family with the people besides it is only by such adherence to justice that in times of like commotion popular excesses can either be mitigated or prevented <\s>
<s> if we would be efficient allies of spain nay if we would not run the risk of doing infinite harm these sentiments must not only be ours as a nation but they must pervade the hearts of our ministers and our generals our agents and our ambassadors <\s>
<s> if it be not so they who are sent abroad must either be conscious how unworthy they are and with what unworthy commissions they appear or not if they do feel this then they must hang their heads and blush for their country and themselves if they do not the spaniards must blush for them and revolt from them or what would be ten thousand times more deplorable they must purchase a reconcilement and a communion by a sacrifice of all that is excellent in themselves <\s>
<s> spain must either break down her lofty spirit her animation and fiery courage to run side by side in the same trammels with great britain or she must start off from her intended yoke fellow with contempt and aversion <\s>
<s> this is the alternative and there is no avoiding it <\s>
<s> i have yet to speak of the influence of such concessions upon the french ruler and his army <\s>
<s> with what satanic pride must he have contemplated the devotion of his servants and adherents to their law the steadiness and zeal of their perverse loyalty and the faithfulness with which they stand by him and each other <\s>
<s> how must his heart have distended with false glory while he contrasted these qualities of his subjects with the insensibility and slackness of his british enemies <\s>
<s> this notice has however no especial propriety in this place for as far as concerns bonaparte his pride and depraved confidence may be equally fed by almost all the conditions of this instrument <\s>
<s> but as to his army it is plain that the permission whether it be considered as by an express article formally granted or only involved in the general conditions of the treaty to bear away in triumph the harvest of its crimes must not only have emboldened and exalted it with arrogance and whetted its rapacity but that hereby every soldier of which this army was composed must upon his arrival in his own country have been a seed which would give back plenteously in its kind <\s>
<s> the french are at present a needy people without commerce or manufactures unsettled in their minds and debased in their morals by revolutionary practices and habits of warfare and the youth of the country are rendered desperate by oppression which leaving no choice in their occupation discharges them from all responsibility to their own consciences <\s>
<s> how powerful then must have been the action of such incitements upon a people so circumstanced <\s>
<s> the actual sight and far more the imaginary sight and handling of these treasures magnified by the romantic tales which must have been spread about them would carry into every town and village an antidote for the terrors of conscription and would rouze men like the dreams imported from the new world when the first discoverers and adventurers returned with their ingots and their gold dust their stories and their promises to inflame and madden the avarice of the old <\s>
<s> what an effect says the governor of cadiz must it have upon the people he means the spanish people to know that a single soldier was carrying away 2580 livres tournois <\s>
<s> what an effect he might have said also must it have upon the french i direct the reader's attention to this because it seems to have been overlooked and because some of the public journals speaking of the convention and no doubt uttering the sentiments of several of their readers say that they are disgusted with the transaction not because the french have been permitted to carry off a few diamonds or some ingots of silver but because we confessed by consenting to the treaty that an army of 35,000 british troops aided by the portugueze nation was not able to compel 20,000 french to surrender at discretion <\s>
<s> this is indeed the root of the evil as hath been shewn and it is the curse of this treaty that the several parts of it are of such enormity as singly to occupy the attention and to destroy comparison and coexistence <\s>
<s> but the people of great britain are disgusted both with the one and the other <\s>
<s> they bewail the violation of the principle if the value of the things carried off had been in itself trifling their grief and their indignation would have been scarcely less <\s>
<s> but it is manifest from what has been said that it was not trifling and that therefore upon that account as well as upon others this permission was no less impolitic than it was unjust and dishonourable <\s>
<s> in illustrating these articles of the armistice and convention by which the french were both expressly permitted and indirectly enabled to carry off their booty we have already seen that a concession was made which is still more enormous viz <\s>
<s> that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or resident there and all natives of portugal who have accepted situations under the french government c shall have their property of every kind guaranteed to them by the british army <\s>
<s> by articles 16th and 17th their persons are placed under the like protection <\s>
<s> the french article xvi shall be at liberty either to accompany the french army or to remain in portugal and the portugueze article xvii shall not be rendered accountable for their political conduct during the period of the occupation of the country by the french army they all are placed under the protection of the british commanders and shall sustain no injury in their property or persons <\s>
<s> i have animadverted heretofore upon the unprofessional eagerness of our generals to appear in the character of negotiators when the sword would have done them more service than the pen <\s>
<s> but if they had confined themselves to mere military regulations they might indeed with justice have been grievously censured as injudicious commanders whose notion of the honour of armies was of a low pitch and who had no conception of the peculiar nature of the service in which they were engaged but the censure must have stopped here <\s>
<s> whereas by these provisions they have shewn that they have never reflected upon the nature of military authority as contra distinguished from civil <\s>
<s> french example had so far dazzled and blinded them that the french army is suffered to denominate itself the french government and from the whole tenour of these instruments from the preamble and these articles especially it should seem that our generals fancied themselves and their army to be the british government <\s>
<s> for these regulations emanating from a mere military authority are purely civil but of such a kind that no power on earth could confer a right to establish them <\s>
<s> and this trampling upon the most sacred rights this sacrifice of the consciousness of a self preserving principle without which neither societies nor governments can exist is not made by our generals in relation to subjects of their own sovereign but to an independent nation our ally into whose territories we could not have entered but from its confidence in our friendship and good faith <\s>
<s> surely the persons who under the countenance of too high authority have talked so loudly of prejudging this question entirely overlooked or utterly forgot this part of it <\s>
<s> what have these monstrous provisions to do with the relative strength of the two armies or with any point admitting a doubt <\s>
<s> what need here of a court of judicature to settle who were the persons their names are subscribed by their own hands and to determine the quality of the thing <\s>
<s> actions and agents like these exhibited in this connection with each other must of necessity be condemned the moment they are known and to assert the contrary is to maintain that man is a being without understanding and that morality is an empty dream <\s>

<s> now let us ask what sense the word property must have had fastened to it in these cases <\s>
<s> must it not necessarily have included all the rewards which the frenchman had received for his iniquity and the traitorous portugueze for his treason <\s>
<s> for no man would bear a part in such oppressions or would be a traitor for nothing and moreover all the rewards which the french could bestow must have been taken from the portugueze extorted from the honest and loyal to be given to the wicked and disloyal these rewards of iniquity must necessarily have been included for on our side no attempt is made at a distinction and on the side of the french the word immoveable is manifestly intended to preclude such a distinction where alone it could have been effectual <\s>
<s> property then here means possessions thus infamously acquired and in the instance of the portugueze the fundamental notion of the word is subverted for a traitor can have no property till the government of his own country has remitted the punishment due to his crimes <\s>
<s> and these wages of guilt which the master by such exactions was enabled to pay and which the servant thus earned are to be guaranteed to him by a british army <\s>
<s> where does there exist a power on earth that could confer this right <\s>
<s> if the portugueze government itself had acted in this manner it would have been guilty of wilful suicide and the nation if it had acted so of high treason against itself <\s>
<s> let it not then be said that the monstrousness of covenanting to convey along with the persons of the french their plunder secures the article from the interpretation which the people of great britain gave and which i have now proved they were bound to give to it but conceding for a moment that it was not intended that the words should bear this sense and that neither in a fair grammatical construction nor as illustrated by other passages or by the general tenour of the document they actually did bear it had not unquestionable voices proclaimed the cruelty and rapacity the acts of sacrilege assassination and robbery by which these treasures had been amassed <\s>
<s> was not the perfidy of the french army and its contempt of moral obligation both as a body and as to the individuals which composed it infamous through europe therefore the concession would signify nothing for our generals by allowing an army of this character to depart with its equipments waggons military chest and baggage had provided abundant means to enable it to carry off whatsoever it desired and thus to elude and frustrate any stipulations which might have been made for compelling it to restore that which had been so iniquitously seized <\s>
<s> and here are we brought back to the fountain head of all this baseness to that apathy and deadness to the principle of justice through the influence of which this army outlawed by its crimes was suffered to depart from the land over which it had so long tyrannized other than as a band of disarmed prisoners i maintain therefore that permission to carry off the booty was distinctly expressed and if it had not been so that the principle of justice could not here be preserved as a violation of it must necessarily have followed from other conditions of the treaty <\s>
<s> sir hew dalrymple himself before the court of inquiry has told us in two letters to generals beresford and friere that such part of the plunder as was in money it would be difficult if not impossible to identify and consequently the french could not be prevented from carrying it away with them <\s>
<s> from the same letters we learn that the french were intending to carry off a considerable part of their plunder by calling it public money and saying that it belonged to the military chest and that their evasions of the article were most shameful and evinced a want of probity and honour which was most disgraceful to them <\s>
<s> if the french had given no other proofs of their want of such virtues than those furnished by this occasion neither the portugueze nor spanish nor british nations would condemn them nor hate them as they now do; nor would this article of the convention have excited such indignation <\s>
<s> for the french by so acting could not deem themselves breaking an engagement no doubt they looked upon themselves as injured that the failure in good faith was on the part of the british and that it was in the lawlessness of power and by a mere quibble that this construction was afterwards put upon the article in question <\s>
<s> widely different from the conduct of the british was that of the spaniards in a like case with high feeling did they abating not a jot or a tittle enforce the principle of justice <\s>
<s> how says the governor of cadiz to general dupont in the same noble letter before alluded to how says he after enumerating the afflictions which his army and the tyrant who had sent it had unjustly brought upon the spanish nation for of these in their dealings with the french they never for a moment lost sight how asks he could you expect that your army should carry off from spain the fruit of its rapacity cruelty and impiety <\s>
<s> how could you conceive this possible or that we should be so stupid or senseless <\s>
<s> and this conduct is as wise in reason as it is true to nature <\s>
<s> the spanish people could have had no confidence in their government if it had not acted thus <\s>
<s> these are the sympathies which prove that a government is paternal that it makes one family with the people besides it is only by such adherence to justice that in times of like commotion popular excesses can either be mitigated or prevented <\s>
<s> if we would be efficient allies of spain nay if we would not run the risk of doing infinite harm these sentiments must not only be ours as a nation but they must pervade the hearts of our ministers and our generals our agents and our ambassadors <\s>
<s> if it be not so they who are sent abroad must either be conscious how unworthy they are and with what unworthy commissions they appear or not if they do feel this then they must hang their heads and blush for their country and themselves if they do not the spaniards must blush for them and revolt from them or what would be ten thousand times more deplorable they must purchase a reconcilement and a communion by a sacrifice of all that is excellent in themselves <\s>
<s> spain must either break down her lofty spirit her animation and fiery courage to run side by side in the same trammels with great britain or she must start off from her intended yoke fellow with contempt and aversion <\s>
<s> this is the alternative and there is no avoiding it <\s>
<s> i have yet to speak of the influence of such concessions upon the french ruler and his army <\s>
<s> with what satanic pride must he have contemplated the devotion of his servants and adherents to their law the steadiness and zeal of their perverse loyalty and the faithfulness with which they stand by him and each other <\s>
<s> how must his heart have distended with false glory while he contrasted these qualities of his subjects with the insensibility and slackness of his british enemies <\s>
<s> this notice has however no especial propriety in this place for as far as concerns bonaparte his pride and depraved confidence may be equally fed by almost all the conditions of this instrument <\s>
<s> but as to his army it is plain that the permission whether it be considered as by an express article formally granted or only involved in the general conditions of the treaty to bear away in triumph the harvest of its crimes must not only have emboldened and exalted it with arrogance and whetted its rapacity but that hereby every soldier of which this army was composed must upon his arrival in his own country have been a seed which would give back plenteously in its kind <\s>
<s> the french are at present a needy people without commerce or manufactures unsettled in their minds and debased in their morals by revolutionary practices and habits of warfare and the youth of the country are rendered desperate by oppression which leaving no choice in their occupation discharges them from all responsibility to their own consciences <\s>
<s> how powerful then must have been the action of such incitements upon a people so circumstanced <\s>
<s> the actual sight and far more the imaginary sight and handling of these treasures magnified by the romantic tales which must have been spread about them would carry into every town and village an antidote for the terrors of conscription and would rouze men like the dreams imported from the new world when the first discoverers and adventurers returned with their ingots and their gold dust their stories and their promises to inflame and madden the avarice of the old <\s>
<s> what an effect says the governor of cadiz must it have upon the people he means the spanish people to know that a single soldier was carrying away 2580 livres tournois <\s>
<s> what an effect he might have said also must it have upon the french i direct the reader's attention to this because it seems to have been overlooked and because some of the public journals speaking of the convention and no doubt uttering the sentiments of several of their readers say that they are disgusted with the transaction not because the french have been permitted to carry off a few diamonds or some ingots of silver but because we confessed by consenting to the treaty that an army of 35,000 british troops aided by the portugueze nation was not able to compel 20,000 french to surrender at discretion <\s>
<s> this is indeed the root of the evil as hath been shewn and it is the curse of this treaty that the several parts of it are of such enormity as singly to occupy the attention and to destroy comparison and coexistence <\s>
<s> but the people of great britain are disgusted both with the one and the other <\s>
<s> they bewail the violation of the principle if the value of the things carried off had been in itself trifling their grief and their indignation would have been scarcely less <\s>
<s> but it is manifest from what has been said that it was not trifling and that therefore upon that account as well as upon others this permission was no less impolitic than it was unjust and dishonourable <\s>
<s> in illustrating these articles of the armistice and convention by which the french were both expressly permitted and indirectly enabled to carry off their booty we have already seen that a concession was made which is still more enormous viz <\s>
<s> that all subjects of france or of powers in alliance with france domiciliated in portugal or resident there and all natives of portugal who have accepted situations under the french government c shall have their property of every kind guaranteed to them by the british army <\s>
<s> by articles 16th and 17th their persons are placed under the like protection <\s>
<s> the french article xvi shall be at liberty either to accompany the french army or to remain in portugal and the portugueze article xvii shall not be rendered accountable for their political conduct during the period of the occupation of the country by the french army they all are placed under the protection of the british commanders and shall sustain no injury in their property or persons <\s>
<s> i have animadverted heretofore upon the unprofessional eagerness of our generals to appear in the character of negotiators when the sword would have done them more service than the pen <\s>
<s> but if they had confined themselves to mere military regulations they might indeed with justice have been grievously censured as injudicious commanders whose notion of the honour of armies was of a low pitch and who had no conception of the peculiar nature of the service in which they were engaged but the censure must have stopped here <\s>
<s> whereas by these provisions they have shewn that they have never reflected upon the nature of military authority as contra distinguished from civil <\s>
<s> french example had so far dazzled and blinded them that the french army is suffered to denominate itself the french government and from the whole tenour of these instruments from the preamble and these articles especially it should seem that our generals fancied themselves and their army to be the british government <\s>
<s> for these regulations emanating from a mere military authority are purely civil but of such a kind that no power on earth could confer a right to establish them <\s>
<s> and this trampling upon the most sacred rights this sacrifice of the consciousness of a self preserving principle without which neither societies nor governments can exist is not made by our generals in relation to subjects of their own sovereign but to an independent nation our ally into whose territories we could not have entered but from its confidence in our friendship and good faith <\s>
<s> surely the persons who under the countenance of too high authority have talked so loudly of prejudging this question entirely overlooked or utterly forgot this part of it <\s>
<s> what have these monstrous provisions to do with the relative strength of the two armies or with any point admitting a doubt <\s>
<s> what need here of a court of judicature to settle who were the persons their names are subscribed by their own hands and to determine the quality of the thing <\s>
<s> actions and agents like these exhibited in this connection with each other must of necessity be condemned the moment they are known and to assert the contrary is to maintain that man is a being without understanding and that morality is an empty dream <\s>
<s> and if this condemnation must after this manner follow to utter it is less a duty than a further inevitable consequence from the constitution of human nature <\s>
<s> they who hold that the formal sanction of a court of judicature is in this case required before a people has a right to pass sentence know not to what degree they are enemies to that people and to mankind to what degree selfishness whether arising from their peculiar situation or from other causes has in them prevailed over those faculties which are our common inheritance and cut them off from fellowship with the species <\s>
<s> most deplorable would be the result if it were possible that the injunctions of these men could be obeyed or their remonstrances acknowledged to be just <\s>
<s> for not to mention that if it were not for such prompt decisions of the public voice misdemeanours of men high in office would rarely be accounted for at all we must bear in mind at this crisis that the adversary of all good is hourly and daily extending his ravages and according to such notions of fitness our indignation our sorrow our shame our sense of right and wrong and all those moral affections and powers of the understanding by which alone he can be effectually opposed are to enter upon a long vacation their motion is to be suspended a thing impossible if it could it would be destroyed <\s>
<s> let us now see what language the portugueze speak upon that part of the treaty which has incited me to give vent to these feelings and to assert these truths <\s>
<s> i protest says general friere against article xvii one of the two now under examination because it attempts to tie down the government of this kingdom not to bring to justice and condign punishment those persons who have been notoriously and scandalously disloyal to their prince and the country by joining and serving the french party and even if the english army should be allowed to screen them from the punishment they have deserved still it should not prevent their expulsion whereby this country would no longer have to fear being again betrayed by the same men <\s>
<s> yet while the partizans of the french are thus guarded not a word is said to protect the loyal portugueze whose fidelity to their country and their prince must have rendered them obnoxious to the french army and who in lisbon and the environs were left at its mercy from the day when the convention was signed till the departure of the french <\s>
<s> couple also with this the first additional article by which it is agreed that the individuals in the civil employment of the army including all the agitators spies informers all the jackals of the ravenous lion made prisoners either by the british troops or the portugueze in any part of portugal will be restored as is customary without exchange <\s>
<s> that is no stipulations being made for reciprocal conditions <\s>
<s> in fact through the whole course of this strange interference of a military power with the administration of civil justice in the country of an ally there is only one article the 15th which bears the least shew of attention to portugueze interests <\s>
<s> by this it is stipulated that from the date of the ratification of the convention all arrears of contributions requisitions or claims whatever of the french government against subjects of portugal or any other individuals residing in this country founded on the occupation of portugal by the french troops in the month of december 1807 which may not have been paid up are cancelled and all sequestrations laid upon their property moveable or immoveable are removed and the free disposal of the same is restored to the proper owners <\s>
<s> which amounts to this <\s>
<s> the french are called upon formally to relinquish in favour of the portugueze that to which they never had any right to abandon false claims which they either had a power to enforce or they had not if they departed immediately and had not power the article was nugatory if they remained a day longer and had power there was no security that they would abide by it <\s>
<s> accordingly loud complaints were made that after the date of the convention all kinds of ravages were committed by the french upon lisbon and its neighbourhood and what did it matter whether these were upon the plea of old debts and requisitions or new debts were created more greedily than ever from the consciousness that the time for collecting them was so short <\s>
<s> this article then the only one which is even in shew favourable to the portugueze is in substance nothing inasmuch as in what it is silent upon viz <\s>
<s> that the people of lisbon and its neighbourhood shall not be vexed and oppressed by the french during their stay with new claims and robberies it is grossly cruel or negligent and in that for which it actually stipulates wholly delusive <\s>
<s> it is in fact insulting for the very admission of a formal renunciation of these claims does to a certain degree acknowledge their justice <\s>
<s> the only decent manner of introducing matter to this effect would have been by placing it as a bye clause of a provision that secured the portugueze from further molestations and merely alluding to it as a thing understood of course <\s>
<s> yet from the place which this specious article occupies preceding immediately the 16th and 17th which we have been last considering it is clear that it must have been intended by the french general as honey smeared upon the edge of the cup to make the poison contained in those two more palateable <\s>
<s> thus much for the portugueze and their particular interests <\s>
<s> in one instance a concern of the spanish nation comes directly under notice and that nation also is treated without delicacy or feeling <\s>
<s> for by the 18th article it is agreed that the spaniards 4000 in number who had been disarmed and were confined on ship board in the port of lisbon by the french should be liberated <\s>
<s> and upon what consideration <\s>
<s> not upon their right to be free as having been treacherously and cruelly dealt with by men who were part of a power that was labouring to subjugate their country and in this attempt had committed inhuman crimes against it not even exchanged as soldiers against soldiers but the condition of their emancipation is that the british general engages to obtain of the spaniards to restore such french subjects either military or civil as have been detained in spain without having been taken in battle or in consequence of military operations but on account of the occurrences of the 29th of last may and the days immediately following <\s>
<s> i know not what are exactly the features of the face for which this word serves as a veil i have no register at hand to inform me what these events precisely were but there can be no doubt that it was a time of triumph for liberty and humanity and that the persons for whom these noble minded spaniards were to be exchanged were no other than a horde from among the most abject of the french nation probably those wretches who having never faced either the dangers or the fatigues of war had been most busy in secret preparations or were most conspicuous in open acts of massacre when the streets of madrid a few weeks before had been drenched with the blood of two thousand of her bravest citizens <\s>
<s> yet the liberation of these spaniards upon these terms is recorded in the report of the court of enquiry as one of the advantages which in the contemplation of the generals would result from the convention <\s>
<s> finally if there shall be any doubt article xiv as to the meaning of any article it shall be explained favourably to the french army and hostages article xx of the rank of field officers on the part of the british army and navy shall be furnished for the guarantee of the present convention <\s>
<s> i have now gone through the painful task of examining the most material conditions of the convention of cintra the whole number of the articles is twenty two with three additional ones a long ladder into a deep abyss of infamy need it be said that neglects injuries and insults like these which we have been contemplating come from what quarter they may let them be exhibited towards whom they will must produce not merely mistrust and jealousy but alienation and hatred <\s>
<s> the passions and feelings may be quieted or diverted for a short time but though out of sight or seemingly asleep they must exist and the life which they have received cannot but by a long course of justice and kindness be overcome and destroyed <\s>
<s> but why talk of a long course of justice and kindness when the immediate result must have been so deplorable <\s>
<s> relying upon our humanity our fellow feeling and our justice upon these instant and urgent claims sanctioned by the more mild one of ancient alliance the portugueze people by voices from every part of their land entreated our succour the arrival of a british army upon their coasts was joyfully hailed and the people of the country zealously assisted in landing the troops without which help as a british general has informed us that landing could not have been effected <\s>
<s> and it is in this manner that they are repaid <\s>

<s> accordingly i kept them by me from week to week with a hope which has proved vain that in some happy moment a new fit of inspiration would help me to mend them and hence my silence which with your usual goodness i know you will excuse <\s>
<s> 29 the happy warrior you will find that the verses are allusive to lord nelson and they will show that i must have sympathised with you in admiration of the man and sorrow for our loss <\s>
<s> yet considering the matter coolly there was little to regret <\s>
<s> the state of lord nelson's health i suppose was such that he could not have lived long and the first burst of exultation upon landing in his native country and his reception here would have been dearly bought perhaps by pain and bodily weakness and distress among his friends which he could neither remove nor alleviate <\s>
<s> few men have ever died under circumstances so likely to make their deaths of benefit to their country it is not easy to see what his life could have done comparable to it <\s>
<s> the loss of such men as lord nelson is indeed great and real but surely not for the reason which makes most people grieve a supposition that no other such man is in the country <\s>
<s> the old ballad has taught us how to feel on these occasions i trust i have within my realm five hundred good as he <\s>
<s> but this is the evil that nowhere is merit so much under the power of what to avoid a more serious expression one may call that of fortune as in military and naval service and it is five hundred to one that such men will not have attained situations where they can show themselves so that the country may know in whom to trust <\s>
<s> lord nelson had attained that situation and therefore i think and not for the other reason ought we chiefly to lament that he is taken from us <\s>
<s> pitt is also gone <\s>
<s> by tens of thousands looked upon in like manner as a great loss <\s>
<s> for my own part as probably you know i have never been able to regard his political life with complacency <\s>
<s> i believe him however to have been as disinterested a man and as true a lover of his country as it was possible for so ambitious a man to be <\s>
<s> his first wish though probably unknown to himself was that his country should prosper under his administration his next that it should prosper <\s>
<s> could the order of these wishes have been reversed mr <\s>
<s> pitt would have avoided many of the grievous mistakes into which i think he fell <\s>
<s> i know my dear sir george you will give me credit for speaking without arrogance and i am aware it is not unlikely you may differ greatly from me in these points <\s>
<s> but i like in some things to differ with a friend and that he should know i differ from him it seems to make a more healthy friendship to act as a relief to those notions and feelings which we have in common and to give them a grace and spirit which they could not otherwise possess <\s>
<s> there were some parts in the long letter which i wrote about laying out grounds in which the expression must have been left imperfect <\s>
<s> i like splendid mansions in their proper places and have no objection to large or even obtrusive houses in themselves <\s>
<s> my dislike is to that system of gardening which because a house happens to be large or splendid and stands at the head of a large domain establishes it therefore as a principle that the house ought to dye all the surrounding country with a strength of colouring and to an extent proportionate to its own importance <\s>
<s> this system i think is founded in false taste false feeling and its effects disgusting in the highest degree <\s>
<s> the reason you mention as having induced you to build was worthy of you and gave me the highest pleasure <\s>

<s> my dear lady beaumont though i am to see you so soon i cannot but write a word or two to thank you for the interest you take in my poems as evinced by your solicitude about their immediate reception <\s>

<s> i do not here take into consideration the envy and malevolence and all the bad passions which always stand in the way of a work of any merit from a living poet but merely think of the pure absolute honest ignorance in which all worldlings of every rank and situation must be enveloped with respect to the thoughts feelings and images on which the life of my poems depends <\s>

<s> in a word for i cannot stop to make my way through the hurry of images that present themselves to me what have they to do with endless talking about things nobody cares any thing for except as far as their own vanity is concerned and this with persons they care nothing for but as their vanity or selfishness is concerned what have they to do to say all at once with a life without love <\s>
<s> in such a life there can be no thought for we have no thought save thoughts of pain but as far as we have love and admiration <\s>
<s> it is an awful truth that there neither is nor can be any genuine enjoyment of poetry among nineteen out of twenty of those persons who live or wish to live in the broad light of the world among those who either are or are striving to make themselves people of consideration in society <\s>
<s> this is a truth and an awful one because to be incapable of a feeling of poetry in my sense of the word is to be without love of human nature and reverence for god <\s>
<s> upon this i shall insist elsewhere at present let me confine myself to my object which is to make you my dear friend as easy hearted as myself with respect to these poems <\s>
<s> trouble not yourself upon their present reception of what moment is that compared with what i trust is their destiny to console the afflicted to add sunshine to daylight by making the happy happier to teach the young and the gracious of every age to see to think and feel and therefore to become more actively and securely virtuous this is their office which i trust they will faithfully perform long after we that is all that is mortal of us are mouldered in our graves <\s>
<s> this is an error and has been merely put in upon common rumour <\s>

<s> i am at present and shall be for some time engaged with a sick friend who has come all the way from bristol on purpose to see us and has taken lodgings in the village but should you be unwell again and my company be like to tend in the least to exhilarate you i should like to know that were it in my power to go and see you i might have the liberty to do so <\s>
<s> having such reason to expect coleridge at present were we at liberty in other respects i cannot think of taking my family on tour agreeable to your kind suggestion <\s>
<s> something has however already been added by your means to our comforts in the way of books and probably we shall be able to make an excursion ere the summer be over <\s>
<s> by the bye are you possessed of houbraken and vertue's heads of illustrious persons with anecdotes of their lives by birch <\s>
<s> i had an opportunity of purchasing a handsome copy far below the price at which it now sells i believe in london at penrith a few weeks ago and if you have not a copy and think the work has any merit you would please me greatly by giving it a place in your library <\s>
<s> i am glad you like the passage in madoc about llewellyn <\s>
<s> southey's mind does not seem strong enough to draw the picture of a hero <\s>
<s> the character of madoc is often very insipid and contemptible for instance when he is told that the foemen have surprised caer madoc and of course he has reason to believe butchered or carried away all the women and children what does the author make him do <\s>
<s> think of goervyl and llayan very tenderly forsooth but not a word about his people <\s>
<s> in short according to my notion the character is throughout languidly conceived and as you observe the contrast between her and llewellyn makes him look very mean <\s>
<s> i made a mistake when i pointed out a beautiful passage as being in the beginning of the meeting of the bards it occurs before and ends thus his eyes were closed his head as if in reverence to receive the inspiration bent and as he raised his glowing countenance and brighter eye and swept with passionate hands the ringing harp <\s>
<s> the verses of your ancestor francis beaumont the younger are very elegant and harmonious and written with true feeling <\s>

<s> there are some pleasing verses i think by corbet bishop of norwich on the death of francis beaumont the elder <\s>
<s> they end i remember thus alluding to his short life by whose sole death appears wit's a disease consumes men in few years <\s>
<s> i have never seen the works of the brother of the dramatic poet but i know he wrote a poem upon the battle of bosworth field <\s>

<s> i do not here take into consideration the envy and malevolence and all the bad passions which always stand in the way of a work of any merit from a living poet but merely think of the pure absolute honest ignorance in which all worldlings of every rank and situation must be enveloped with respect to the thoughts feelings and images on which the life of my poems depends <\s>

<s> in a word for i cannot stop to make my way through the hurry of images that present themselves to me what have they to do with endless talking about things nobody cares any thing for except as far as their own vanity is concerned and this with persons they care nothing for but as their vanity or selfishness is concerned what have they to do to say all at once with a life without love <\s>
<s> in such a life there can be no thought for we have no thought save thoughts of pain but as far as we have love and admiration <\s>

<s> this is a truth and an awful one because to be incapable of a feeling of poetry in my sense of the word is to be without love of human nature and reverence for god <\s>
<s> upon this i shall insist elsewhere at present let me confine myself to my object which is to make you my dear friend as easy hearted as myself with respect to these poems <\s>

<s> my dear lady beaumont though i am to see you so soon i cannot but write a word or two to thank you for the interest you take in my poems as evinced by your solicitude about their immediate reception <\s>

<s> in a word for i cannot stop to make my way through the hurry of images that present themselves to me what have they to do with endless talking about things nobody cares any thing for except as far as their own vanity is concerned and this with persons they care nothing for but as their vanity or selfishness is concerned what have they to do to say all at once with a life without love <\s>
<s> in such a life there can be no thought for we have no thought save thoughts of pain but as far as we have love and admiration <\s>

<s> upon this i shall insist elsewhere at present let me confine myself to my object which is to make you my dear friend as easy hearted as myself with respect to these poems <\s>

<s> letter to sir george h <\s>
<s> my dear sir george upon opening this letter you must have seen that it is accompanied with a copy of verses 29 i hope they will give you some pleasure as it will be the best way in which they can repay me for a little vexation of which they have been the cause <\s>
<s> they were written several weeks ago and i wished to send them to you but could not muster up resolution as i felt that they were so unworthy of the subject <\s>
<s> accordingly i kept them by me from week to week with a hope which has proved vain that in some happy moment a new fit of inspiration would help me to mend them and hence my silence which with your usual goodness i know you will excuse <\s>
<s> 29 the happy warrior you will find that the verses are allusive to lord nelson and they will show that i must have sympathised with you in admiration of the man and sorrow for our loss <\s>
<s> yet considering the matter coolly there was little to regret <\s>
<s> the state of lord nelson's health i suppose was such that he could not have lived long and the first burst of exultation upon landing in his native country and his reception here would have been dearly bought perhaps by pain and bodily weakness and distress among his friends which he could neither remove nor alleviate <\s>
<s> few men have ever died under circumstances so likely to make their deaths of benefit to their country it is not easy to see what his life could have done comparable to it <\s>
<s> the loss of such men as lord nelson is indeed great and real but surely not for the reason which makes most people grieve a supposition that no other such man is in the country <\s>
<s> the old ballad has taught us how to feel on these occasions i trust i have within my realm five hundred good as he <\s>
<s> but this is the evil that nowhere is merit so much under the power of what to avoid a more serious expression one may call that of fortune as in military and naval service and it is five hundred to one that such men will not have attained situations where they can show themselves so that the country may know in whom to trust <\s>
<s> lord nelson had attained that situation and therefore i think and not for the other reason ought we chiefly to lament that he is taken from us <\s>
<s> pitt is also gone <\s>
<s> by tens of thousands looked upon in like manner as a great loss <\s>
<s> for my own part as probably you know i have never been able to regard his political life with complacency <\s>
<s> i believe him however to have been as disinterested a man and as true a lover of his country as it was possible for so ambitious a man to be <\s>
<s> his first wish though probably unknown to himself was that his country should prosper under his administration his next that it should prosper <\s>
<s> could the order of these wishes have been reversed mr <\s>
<s> pitt would have avoided many of the grievous mistakes into which i think he fell <\s>
<s> i know my dear sir george you will give me credit for speaking without arrogance and i am aware it is not unlikely you may differ greatly from me in these points <\s>
<s> but i like in some things to differ with a friend and that he should know i differ from him it seems to make a more healthy friendship to act as a relief to those notions and feelings which we have in common and to give them a grace and spirit which they could not otherwise possess <\s>
<s> there were some parts in the long letter which i wrote about laying out grounds in which the expression must have been left imperfect <\s>
<s> i like splendid mansions in their proper places and have no objection to large or even obtrusive houses in themselves <\s>
<s> my dislike is to that system of gardening which because a house happens to be large or splendid and stands at the head of a large domain establishes it therefore as a principle that the house ought to dye all the surrounding country with a strength of colouring and to an extent proportionate to its own importance <\s>
<s> this system i think is founded in false taste false feeling and its effects disgusting in the highest degree <\s>

<s> i write partly to thank you for this and to express the pleasure it has given me and partly to remove any uneasiness from your mind which the disappointments you sometimes meet with in this labour of love may occasion <\s>
<s> i see that you have many battles to fight for me more than in the ardour and confidence of your pure and elevated mind you had ever thought of being summoned to but be assured that this opposition is nothing more than what i distinctly foresaw that you and my other friends would have to encounter <\s>
<s> i say this not to give myself credit for an eye of prophecy but to allay any vexatious thoughts on my account which this opposition may have produced in you <\s>
<s> it is impossible that any expectations can be lower than mine concerning the immediate effect of this little work upon what is called the public <\s>
<s> i do not here take into consideration the envy and malevolence and all the bad passions which always stand in the way of a work of any merit from a living poet but merely think of the pure absolute honest ignorance in which all worldlings of every rank and situation must be enveloped with respect to the thoughts feelings and images on which the life of my poems depends <\s>
<s> the things which i have taken whether from within or without what have they to do with routs dinners morning calls hurry from door to door from street to street on foot or in carriage with mr <\s>
<s> paul or sir francis burdett the westminster election or the borough of honiton <\s>
<s> in a word for i cannot stop to make my way through the hurry of images that present themselves to me what have they to do with endless talking about things nobody cares any thing for except as far as their own vanity is concerned and this with persons they care nothing for but as their vanity or selfishness is concerned what have they to do to say all at once with a life without love <\s>
<s> in such a life there can be no thought for we have no thought save thoughts of pain but as far as we have love and admiration <\s>
<s> it is an awful truth that there neither is nor can be any genuine enjoyment of poetry among nineteen out of twenty of those persons who live or wish to live in the broad light of the world among those who either are or are striving to make themselves people of consideration in society <\s>
<s> this is a truth and an awful one because to be incapable of a feeling of poetry in my sense of the word is to be without love of human nature and reverence for god <\s>
<s> upon this i shall insist elsewhere at present let me confine myself to my object which is to make you my dear friend as easy hearted as myself with respect to these poems <\s>
<s> trouble not yourself upon their present reception of what moment is that compared with what i trust is their destiny to console the afflicted to add sunshine to daylight by making the happy happier to teach the young and the gracious of every age to see to think and feel and therefore to become more actively and securely virtuous this is their office which i trust they will faithfully perform long after we that is all that is mortal of us are mouldered in our graves <\s>
<s> this is an error and has been merely put in upon common rumour <\s>
<s> when you were ill i had a thought which i will mention to you <\s>
<s> it was this i wished to know how you were at present situated as to house room at coleorton that is whether you could have found a corner for me to put my head in in case i could have contrived to have commanded three weeks time or so <\s>
<s> i am at present and shall be for some time engaged with a sick friend who has come all the way from bristol on purpose to see us and has taken lodgings in the village but should you be unwell again and my company be like to tend in the least to exhilarate you i should like to know that were it in my power to go and see you i might have the liberty to do so <\s>
<s> having such reason to expect coleridge at present were we at liberty in other respects i cannot think of taking my family on tour agreeable to your kind suggestion <\s>
<s> something has however already been added by your means to our comforts in the way of books and probably we shall be able to make an excursion ere the summer be over <\s>
<s> by the bye are you possessed of houbraken and vertue's heads of illustrious persons with anecdotes of their lives by birch <\s>
<s> i had an opportunity of purchasing a handsome copy far below the price at which it now sells i believe in london at penrith a few weeks ago and if you have not a copy and think the work has any merit you would please me greatly by giving it a place in your library <\s>
<s> i am glad you like the passage in madoc about llewellyn <\s>
<s> southey's mind does not seem strong enough to draw the picture of a hero <\s>
<s> the character of madoc is often very insipid and contemptible for instance when he is told that the foemen have surprised caer madoc and of course he has reason to believe butchered or carried away all the women and children what does the author make him do <\s>
<s> think of goervyl and llayan very tenderly forsooth but not a word about his people <\s>
<s> in short according to my notion the character is throughout languidly conceived and as you observe the contrast between her and llewellyn makes him look very mean <\s>
<s> i made a mistake when i pointed out a beautiful passage as being in the beginning of the meeting of the bards it occurs before and ends thus his eyes were closed his head as if in reverence to receive the inspiration bent and as he raised his glowing countenance and brighter eye and swept with passionate hands the ringing harp <\s>
<s> the verses of your ancestor francis beaumont the younger are very elegant and harmonious and written with true feeling <\s>

<s> there are some pleasing verses i think by corbet bishop of norwich on the death of francis beaumont the elder <\s>
<s> they end i remember thus alluding to his short life by whose sole death appears wit's a disease consumes men in few years <\s>
<s> i have never seen the works of the brother of the dramatic poet but i know he wrote a poem upon the battle of bosworth field <\s>
<s> probably it will be in the volume which you have found which it would give me great pleasure to see as also charnwood rocks which must have a striking effect in that country <\s>
<s> i am highly flattered by lady beaumont's favourable opinion of me and my poems <\s>
<s> my sister will answer her affectionate letter very soon she would have done it before now but she has been from home three days and unwell or entirely engrossed with some visitors whom we have had the rest of her time <\s>

<s> 1805 an event happened here last night which has greatly affected the whole village and particularly myself <\s>
<s> the body or more properly speaking bones of a poor fellow were yesterday found by willy harrison in the rocks at the head of red tarn <\s>

<s> it appears that he proceeded forward and met his fate <\s>
<s> you will be much interested to know that a spaniel bitch was found alive by his side where she has remained upwards of three months guarding the bones of her master but she had become so wild that it was with difficulty she was taken <\s>
<s> she is in good condition and what is more odd had whelped a pup which from its size must have lived some weeks but when found was lying dead by the bones <\s>
<s> the bones are as completely freed from flesh as if they had been anatomised and perfectly white and dry <\s>
<s> the head can nowhere be found <\s>
<s> the arms one thigh and a leg were all that remained in the clothes <\s>
<s> all the rest were scattered about here and there <\s>
<s> when i reflect on my own wanderings and the many dangerous situations i have found myself in in the pursuit of game i cannot help thanking providence that i am now here to relate to you this melancholy tale <\s>

<s> of lord nelson and the happy warrior and pitt and on building gardening c <\s>
<s> letter to sir george h <\s>
<s> my dear sir george upon opening this letter you must have seen that it is accompanied with a copy of verses 29 i hope they will give you some pleasure as it will be the best way in which they can repay me for a little vexation of which they have been the cause <\s>
<s> they were written several weeks ago and i wished to send them to you but could not muster up resolution as i felt that they were so unworthy of the subject <\s>
<s> accordingly i kept them by me from week to week with a hope which has proved vain that in some happy moment a new fit of inspiration would help me to mend them and hence my silence which with your usual goodness i know you will excuse <\s>
<s> 29 the happy warrior you will find that the verses are allusive to lord nelson and they will show that i must have sympathised with you in admiration of the man and sorrow for our loss <\s>
<s> yet considering the matter coolly there was little to regret <\s>
<s> the state of lord nelson's health i suppose was such that he could not have lived long and the first burst of exultation upon landing in his native country and his reception here would have been dearly bought perhaps by pain and bodily weakness and distress among his friends which he could neither remove nor alleviate <\s>
<s> few men have ever died under circumstances so likely to make their deaths of benefit to their country it is not easy to see what his life could have done comparable to it <\s>
<s> the loss of such men as lord nelson is indeed great and real but surely not for the reason which makes most people grieve a supposition that no other such man is in the country <\s>
<s> the old ballad has taught us how to feel on these occasions i trust i have within my realm five hundred good as he <\s>
<s> but this is the evil that nowhere is merit so much under the power of what to avoid a more serious expression one may call that of fortune as in military and naval service and it is five hundred to one that such men will not have attained situations where they can show themselves so that the country may know in whom to trust <\s>
<s> lord nelson had attained that situation and therefore i think and not for the other reason ought we chiefly to lament that he is taken from us <\s>
<s> pitt is also gone <\s>
<s> by tens of thousands looked upon in like manner as a great loss <\s>
<s> for my own part as probably you know i have never been able to regard his political life with complacency <\s>
<s> i believe him however to have been as disinterested a man and as true a lover of his country as it was possible for so ambitious a man to be <\s>
<s> his first wish though probably unknown to himself was that his country should prosper under his administration his next that it should prosper <\s>
<s> could the order of these wishes have been reversed mr <\s>
<s> pitt would have avoided many of the grievous mistakes into which i think he fell <\s>
<s> i know my dear sir george you will give me credit for speaking without arrogance and i am aware it is not unlikely you may differ greatly from me in these points <\s>
<s> but i like in some things to differ with a friend and that he should know i differ from him it seems to make a more healthy friendship to act as a relief to those notions and feelings which we have in common and to give them a grace and spirit which they could not otherwise possess <\s>
<s> there were some parts in the long letter which i wrote about laying out grounds in which the expression must have been left imperfect <\s>
<s> i like splendid mansions in their proper places and have no objection to large or even obtrusive houses in themselves <\s>
<s> my dislike is to that system of gardening which because a house happens to be large or splendid and stands at the head of a large domain establishes it therefore as a principle that the house ought to dye all the surrounding country with a strength of colouring and to an extent proportionate to its own importance <\s>
<s> this system i think is founded in false taste false feeling and its effects disgusting in the highest degree <\s>
<s> the reason you mention as having induced you to build was worthy of you and gave me the highest pleasure <\s>

<s> i know my dear sir george you will give me credit for speaking without arrogance and i am aware it is not unlikely you may differ greatly from me in these points <\s>

<s> accordingly i kept them by me from week to week with a hope which has proved vain that in some happy moment a new fit of inspiration would help me to mend them and hence my silence which with your usual goodness i know you will excuse <\s>
<s> 29 the happy warrior you will find that the verses are allusive to lord nelson and they will show that i must have sympathised with you in admiration of the man and sorrow for our loss <\s>
<s> yet considering the matter coolly there was little to regret <\s>
<s> the state of lord nelson's health i suppose was such that he could not have lived long and the first burst of exultation upon landing in his native country and his reception here would have been dearly bought perhaps by pain and bodily weakness and distress among his friends which he could neither remove nor alleviate <\s>
<s> few men have ever died under circumstances so likely to make their deaths of benefit to their country it is not easy to see what his life could have done comparable to it <\s>
<s> the loss of such men as lord nelson is indeed great and real but surely not for the reason which makes most people grieve a supposition that no other such man is in the country <\s>
<s> the old ballad has taught us how to feel on these occasions i trust i have within my realm five hundred good as he <\s>
<s> but this is the evil that nowhere is merit so much under the power of what to avoid a more serious expression one may call that of fortune as in military and naval service and it is five hundred to one that such men will not have attained situations where they can show themselves so that the country may know in whom to trust <\s>
<s> lord nelson had attained that situation and therefore i think and not for the other reason ought we chiefly to lament that he is taken from us <\s>
<s> pitt is also gone <\s>
<s> by tens of thousands looked upon in like manner as a great loss <\s>
<s> for my own part as probably you know i have never been able to regard his political life with complacency <\s>
<s> i believe him however to have been as disinterested a man and as true a lover of his country as it was possible for so ambitious a man to be <\s>
<s> his first wish though probably unknown to himself was that his country should prosper under his administration his next that it should prosper <\s>
<s> could the order of these wishes have been reversed mr <\s>
<s> pitt would have avoided many of the grievous mistakes into which i think he fell <\s>
<s> i know my dear sir george you will give me credit for speaking without arrogance and i am aware it is not unlikely you may differ greatly from me in these points <\s>
<s> but i like in some things to differ with a friend and that he should know i differ from him it seems to make a more healthy friendship to act as a relief to those notions and feelings which we have in common and to give them a grace and spirit which they could not otherwise possess <\s>
<s> there were some parts in the long letter which i wrote about laying out grounds in which the expression must have been left imperfect <\s>
<s> i like splendid mansions in their proper places and have no objection to large or even obtrusive houses in themselves <\s>
<s> my dislike is to that system of gardening which because a house happens to be large or splendid and stands at the head of a large domain establishes it therefore as a principle that the house ought to dye all the surrounding country with a strength of colouring and to an extent proportionate to its own importance <\s>
<s> this system i think is founded in false taste false feeling and its effects disgusting in the highest degree <\s>
<s> the reason you mention as having induced you to build was worthy of you and gave me the highest pleasure <\s>

<s> my dear lady beaumont though i am to see you so soon i cannot but write a word or two to thank you for the interest you take in my poems as evinced by your solicitude about their immediate reception <\s>

<s> i do not here take into consideration the envy and malevolence and all the bad passions which always stand in the way of a work of any merit from a living poet but merely think of the pure absolute honest ignorance in which all worldlings of every rank and situation must be enveloped with respect to the thoughts feelings and images on which the life of my poems depends <\s>

<s> in a word for i cannot stop to make my way through the hurry of images that present themselves to me what have they to do with endless talking about things nobody cares any thing for except as far as their own vanity is concerned and this with persons they care nothing for but as their vanity or selfishness is concerned what have they to do to say all at once with a life without love <\s>
<s> in such a life there can be no thought for we have no thought save thoughts of pain but as far as we have love and admiration <\s>
<s> it is an awful truth that there neither is nor can be any genuine enjoyment of poetry among nineteen out of twenty of those persons who live or wish to live in the broad light of the world among those who either are or are striving to make themselves people of consideration in society <\s>
<s> this is a truth and an awful one because to be incapable of a feeling of poetry in my sense of the word is to be without love of human nature and reverence for god <\s>
<s> upon this i shall insist elsewhere at present let me confine myself to my object which is to make you my dear friend as easy hearted as myself with respect to these poems <\s>
<s> trouble not yourself upon their present reception of what moment is that compared with what i trust is their destiny to console the afflicted to add sunshine to daylight by making the happy happier to teach the young and the gracious of every age to see to think and feel and therefore to become more actively and securely virtuous this is their office which i trust they will faithfully perform long after we that is all that is mortal of us are mouldered in our graves <\s>
<s> this is an error and has been merely put in upon common rumour <\s>

<s> i am at present and shall be for some time engaged with a sick friend who has come all the way from bristol on purpose to see us and has taken lodgings in the village but should you be unwell again and my company be like to tend in the least to exhilarate you i should like to know that were it in my power to go and see you i might have the liberty to do so <\s>
<s> having such reason to expect coleridge at present were we at liberty in other respects i cannot think of taking my family on tour agreeable to your kind suggestion <\s>
<s> something has however already been added by your means to our comforts in the way of books and probably we shall be able to make an excursion ere the summer be over <\s>
<s> by the bye are you possessed of houbraken and vertue's heads of illustrious persons with anecdotes of their lives by birch <\s>
<s> i had an opportunity of purchasing a handsome copy far below the price at which it now sells i believe in london at penrith a few weeks ago and if you have not a copy and think the work has any merit you would please me greatly by giving it a place in your library <\s>
<s> i am glad you like the passage in madoc about llewellyn <\s>
<s> southey's mind does not seem strong enough to draw the picture of a hero <\s>
<s> the character of madoc is often very insipid and contemptible for instance when he is told that the foemen have surprised caer madoc and of course he has reason to believe butchered or carried away all the women and children what does the author make him do <\s>
<s> think of goervyl and llayan very tenderly forsooth but not a word about his people <\s>
<s> in short according to my notion the character is throughout languidly conceived and as you observe the contrast between her and llewellyn makes him look very mean <\s>
<s> i made a mistake when i pointed out a beautiful passage as being in the beginning of the meeting of the bards it occurs before and ends thus his eyes were closed his head as if in reverence to receive the inspiration bent and as he raised his glowing countenance and brighter eye and swept with passionate hands the ringing harp <\s>
<s> the verses of your ancestor francis beaumont the younger are very elegant and harmonious and written with true feeling <\s>

<s> there are some pleasing verses i think by corbet bishop of norwich on the death of francis beaumont the elder <\s>
<s> they end i remember thus alluding to his short life by whose sole death appears wit's a disease consumes men in few years <\s>
<s> i have never seen the works of the brother of the dramatic poet but i know he wrote a poem upon the battle of bosworth field <\s>

<s> i do not here take into consideration the envy and malevolence and all the bad passions which always stand in the way of a work of any merit from a living poet but merely think of the pure absolute honest ignorance in which all worldlings of every rank and situation must be enveloped with respect to the thoughts feelings and images on which the life of my poems depends <\s>

<s> in a word for i cannot stop to make my way through the hurry of images that present themselves to me what have they to do with endless talking about things nobody cares any thing for except as far as their own vanity is concerned and this with persons they care nothing for but as their vanity or selfishness is concerned what have they to do to say all at once with a life without love <\s>
<s> in such a life there can be no thought for we have no thought save thoughts of pain but as far as we have love and admiration <\s>

<s> this is a truth and an awful one because to be incapable of a feeling of poetry in my sense of the word is to be without love of human nature and reverence for god <\s>
<s> upon this i shall insist elsewhere at present let me confine myself to my object which is to make you my dear friend as easy hearted as myself with respect to these poems <\s>

<s> my dear lady beaumont though i am to see you so soon i cannot but write a word or two to thank you for the interest you take in my poems as evinced by your solicitude about their immediate reception <\s>

<s> in a word for i cannot stop to make my way through the hurry of images that present themselves to me what have they to do with endless talking about things nobody cares any thing for except as far as their own vanity is concerned and this with persons they care nothing for but as their vanity or selfishness is concerned what have they to do to say all at once with a life without love <\s>
<s> in such a life there can be no thought for we have no thought save thoughts of pain but as far as we have love and admiration <\s>

<s> upon this i shall insist elsewhere at present let me confine myself to my object which is to make you my dear friend as easy hearted as myself with respect to these poems <\s>

<s> letter to sir george h <\s>
<s> my dear sir george upon opening this letter you must have seen that it is accompanied with a copy of verses 29 i hope they will give you some pleasure as it will be the best way in which they can repay me for a little vexation of which they have been the cause <\s>
<s> they were written several weeks ago and i wished to send them to you but could not muster up resolution as i felt that they were so unworthy of the subject <\s>
<s> accordingly i kept them by me from week to week with a hope which has proved vain that in some happy moment a new fit of inspiration would help me to mend them and hence my silence which with your usual goodness i know you will excuse <\s>
<s> 29 the happy warrior you will find that the verses are allusive to lord nelson and they will show that i must have sympathised with you in admiration of the man and sorrow for our loss <\s>
<s> yet considering the matter coolly there was little to regret <\s>
<s> the state of lord nelson's health i suppose was such that he could not have lived long and the first burst of exultation upon landing in his native country and his reception here would have been dearly bought perhaps by pain and bodily weakness and distress among his friends which he could neither remove nor alleviate <\s>
<s> few men have ever died under circumstances so likely to make their deaths of benefit to their country it is not easy to see what his life could have done comparable to it <\s>
<s> the loss of such men as lord nelson is indeed great and real but surely not for the reason which makes most people grieve a supposition that no other such man is in the country <\s>
<s> the old ballad has taught us how to feel on these occasions i trust i have within my realm five hundred good as he <\s>
<s> but this is the evil that nowhere is merit so much under the power of what to avoid a more serious expression one may call that of fortune as in military and naval service and it is five hundred to one that such men will not have attained situations where they can show themselves so that the country may know in whom to trust <\s>
<s> lord nelson had attained that situation and therefore i think and not for the other reason ought we chiefly to lament that he is taken from us <\s>
<s> pitt is also gone <\s>
<s> by tens of thousands looked upon in like manner as a great loss <\s>
<s> for my own part as probably you know i have never been able to regard his political life with complacency <\s>
<s> i believe him however to have been as disinterested a man and as true a lover of his country as it was possible for so ambitious a man to be <\s>
<s> his first wish though probably unknown to himself was that his country should prosper under his administration his next that it should prosper <\s>
<s> could the order of these wishes have been reversed mr <\s>
<s> pitt would have avoided many of the grievous mistakes into which i think he fell <\s>
<s> i know my dear sir george you will give me credit for speaking without arrogance and i am aware it is not unlikely you may differ greatly from me in these points <\s>
<s> but i like in some things to differ with a friend and that he should know i differ from him it seems to make a more healthy friendship to act as a relief to those notions and feelings which we have in common and to give them a grace and spirit which they could not otherwise possess <\s>
<s> there were some parts in the long letter which i wrote about laying out grounds in which the expression must have been left imperfect <\s>
<s> i like splendid mansions in their proper places and have no objection to large or even obtrusive houses in themselves <\s>
<s> my dislike is to that system of gardening which because a house happens to be large or splendid and stands at the head of a large domain establishes it therefore as a principle that the house ought to dye all the surrounding country with a strength of colouring and to an extent proportionate to its own importance <\s>
<s> this system i think is founded in false taste false feeling and its effects disgusting in the highest degree <\s>

<s> i write partly to thank you for this and to express the pleasure it has given me and partly to remove any uneasiness from your mind which the disappointments you sometimes meet with in this labour of love may occasion <\s>
<s> i see that you have many battles to fight for me more than in the ardour and confidence of your pure and elevated mind you had ever thought of being summoned to but be assured that this opposition is nothing more than what i distinctly foresaw that you and my other friends would have to encounter <\s>
<s> i say this not to give myself credit for an eye of prophecy but to allay any vexatious thoughts on my account which this opposition may have produced in you <\s>
<s> it is impossible that any expectations can be lower than mine concerning the immediate effect of this little work upon what is called the public <\s>
<s> i do not here take into consideration the envy and malevolence and all the bad passions which always stand in the way of a work of any merit from a living poet but merely think of the pure absolute honest ignorance in which all worldlings of every rank and situation must be enveloped with respect to the thoughts feelings and images on which the life of my poems depends <\s>
<s> the things which i have taken whether from within or without what have they to do with routs dinners morning calls hurry from door to door from street to street on foot or in carriage with mr <\s>
<s> paul or sir francis burdett the westminster election or the borough of honiton <\s>
<s> in a word for i cannot stop to make my way through the hurry of images that present themselves to me what have they to do with endless talking about things nobody cares any thing for except as far as their own vanity is concerned and this with persons they care nothing for but as their vanity or selfishness is concerned what have they to do to say all at once with a life without love <\s>
<s> in such a life there can be no thought for we have no thought save thoughts of pain but as far as we have love and admiration <\s>
<s> it is an awful truth that there neither is nor can be any genuine enjoyment of poetry among nineteen out of twenty of those persons who live or wish to live in the broad light of the world among those who either are or are striving to make themselves people of consideration in society <\s>
<s> this is a truth and an awful one because to be incapable of a feeling of poetry in my sense of the word is to be without love of human nature and reverence for god <\s>
<s> upon this i shall insist elsewhere at present let me confine myself to my object which is to make you my dear friend as easy hearted as myself with respect to these poems <\s>
<s> trouble not yourself upon their present reception of what moment is that compared with what i trust is their destiny to console the afflicted to add sunshine to daylight by making the happy happier to teach the young and the gracious of every age to see to think and feel and therefore to become more actively and securely virtuous this is their office which i trust they will faithfully perform long after we that is all that is mortal of us are mouldered in our graves <\s>
<s> this is an error and has been merely put in upon common rumour <\s>
<s> when you were ill i had a thought which i will mention to you <\s>
<s> it was this i wished to know how you were at present situated as to house room at coleorton that is whether you could have found a corner for me to put my head in in case i could have contrived to have commanded three weeks time or so <\s>
<s> i am at present and shall be for some time engaged with a sick friend who has come all the way from bristol on purpose to see us and has taken lodgings in the village but should you be unwell again and my company be like to tend in the least to exhilarate you i should like to know that were it in my power to go and see you i might have the liberty to do so <\s>
<s> having such reason to expect coleridge at present were we at liberty in other respects i cannot think of taking my family on tour agreeable to your kind suggestion <\s>
<s> something has however already been added by your means to our comforts in the way of books and probably we shall be able to make an excursion ere the summer be over <\s>
<s> by the bye are you possessed of houbraken and vertue's heads of illustrious persons with anecdotes of their lives by birch <\s>
<s> i had an opportunity of purchasing a handsome copy far below the price at which it now sells i believe in london at penrith a few weeks ago and if you have not a copy and think the work has any merit you would please me greatly by giving it a place in your library <\s>
<s> i am glad you like the passage in madoc about llewellyn <\s>
<s> southey's mind does not seem strong enough to draw the picture of a hero <\s>
<s> the character of madoc is often very insipid and contemptible for instance when he is told that the foemen have surprised caer madoc and of course he has reason to believe butchered or carried away all the women and children what does the author make him do <\s>
<s> think of goervyl and llayan very tenderly forsooth but not a word about his people <\s>
<s> in short according to my notion the character is throughout languidly conceived and as you observe the contrast between her and llewellyn makes him look very mean <\s>
<s> i made a mistake when i pointed out a beautiful passage as being in the beginning of the meeting of the bards it occurs before and ends thus his eyes were closed his head as if in reverence to receive the inspiration bent and as he raised his glowing countenance and brighter eye and swept with passionate hands the ringing harp <\s>
<s> the verses of your ancestor francis beaumont the younger are very elegant and harmonious and written with true feeling <\s>

<s> there are some pleasing verses i think by corbet bishop of norwich on the death of francis beaumont the elder <\s>
<s> they end i remember thus alluding to his short life by whose sole death appears wit's a disease consumes men in few years <\s>
<s> i have never seen the works of the brother of the dramatic poet but i know he wrote a poem upon the battle of bosworth field <\s>
<s> probably it will be in the volume which you have found which it would give me great pleasure to see as also charnwood rocks which must have a striking effect in that country <\s>
<s> i am highly flattered by lady beaumont's favourable opinion of me and my poems <\s>
<s> my sister will answer her affectionate letter very soon she would have done it before now but she has been from home three days and unwell or entirely engrossed with some visitors whom we have had the rest of her time <\s>

<s> 1805 an event happened here last night which has greatly affected the whole village and particularly myself <\s>
<s> the body or more properly speaking bones of a poor fellow were yesterday found by willy harrison in the rocks at the head of red tarn <\s>

<s> it appears that he proceeded forward and met his fate <\s>
<s> you will be much interested to know that a spaniel bitch was found alive by his side where she has remained upwards of three months guarding the bones of her master but she had become so wild that it was with difficulty she was taken <\s>
<s> she is in good condition and what is more odd had whelped a pup which from its size must have lived some weeks but when found was lying dead by the bones <\s>
<s> the bones are as completely freed from flesh as if they had been anatomised and perfectly white and dry <\s>
<s> the head can nowhere be found <\s>
<s> the arms one thigh and a leg were all that remained in the clothes <\s>
<s> all the rest were scattered about here and there <\s>
<s> when i reflect on my own wanderings and the many dangerous situations i have found myself in in the pursuit of game i cannot help thanking providence that i am now here to relate to you this melancholy tale <\s>

<s> of lord nelson and the happy warrior and pitt and on building gardening c <\s>
<s> letter to sir george h <\s>
<s> my dear sir george upon opening this letter you must have seen that it is accompanied with a copy of verses 29 i hope they will give you some pleasure as it will be the best way in which they can repay me for a little vexation of which they have been the cause <\s>
<s> they were written several weeks ago and i wished to send them to you but could not muster up resolution as i felt that they were so unworthy of the subject <\s>
<s> accordingly i kept them by me from week to week with a hope which has proved vain that in some happy moment a new fit of inspiration would help me to mend them and hence my silence which with your usual goodness i know you will excuse <\s>
<s> 29 the happy warrior you will find that the verses are allusive to lord nelson and they will show that i must have sympathised with you in admiration of the man and sorrow for our loss <\s>
<s> yet considering the matter coolly there was little to regret <\s>
<s> the state of lord nelson's health i suppose was such that he could not have lived long and the first burst of exultation upon landing in his native country and his reception here would have been dearly bought perhaps by pain and bodily weakness and distress among his friends which he could neither remove nor alleviate <\s>
<s> few men have ever died under circumstances so likely to make their deaths of benefit to their country it is not easy to see what his life could have done comparable to it <\s>
<s> the loss of such men as lord nelson is indeed great and real but surely not for the reason which makes most people grieve a supposition that no other such man is in the country <\s>
<s> the old ballad has taught us how to feel on these occasions i trust i have within my realm five hundred good as he <\s>
<s> but this is the evil that nowhere is merit so much under the power of what to avoid a more serious expression one may call that of fortune as in military and naval service and it is five hundred to one that such men will not have attained situations where they can show themselves so that the country may know in whom to trust <\s>
<s> lord nelson had attained that situation and therefore i think and not for the other reason ought we chiefly to lament that he is taken from us <\s>
<s> pitt is also gone <\s>
<s> by tens of thousands looked upon in like manner as a great loss <\s>
<s> for my own part as probably you know i have never been able to regard his political life with complacency <\s>
<s> i believe him however to have been as disinterested a man and as true a lover of his country as it was possible for so ambitious a man to be <\s>
<s> his first wish though probably unknown to himself was that his country should prosper under his administration his next that it should prosper <\s>
<s> could the order of these wishes have been reversed mr <\s>
<s> pitt would have avoided many of the grievous mistakes into which i think he fell <\s>
<s> i know my dear sir george you will give me credit for speaking without arrogance and i am aware it is not unlikely you may differ greatly from me in these points <\s>
<s> but i like in some things to differ with a friend and that he should know i differ from him it seems to make a more healthy friendship to act as a relief to those notions and feelings which we have in common and to give them a grace and spirit which they could not otherwise possess <\s>
<s> there were some parts in the long letter which i wrote about laying out grounds in which the expression must have been left imperfect <\s>
<s> i like splendid mansions in their proper places and have no objection to large or even obtrusive houses in themselves <\s>
<s> my dislike is to that system of gardening which because a house happens to be large or splendid and stands at the head of a large domain establishes it therefore as a principle that the house ought to dye all the surrounding country with a strength of colouring and to an extent proportionate to its own importance <\s>
<s> this system i think is founded in false taste false feeling and its effects disgusting in the highest degree <\s>
<s> the reason you mention as having induced you to build was worthy of you and gave me the highest pleasure <\s>

<s> i know my dear sir george you will give me credit for speaking without arrogance and i am aware it is not unlikely you may differ greatly from me in these points <\s>

<s> accordingly i kept them by me from week to week with a hope which has proved vain that in some happy moment a new fit of inspiration would help me to mend them and hence my silence which with your usual goodness i know you will excuse <\s>
<s> 29 the happy warrior you will find that the verses are allusive to lord nelson and they will show that i must have sympathised with you in admiration of the man and sorrow for our loss <\s>
<s> yet considering the matter coolly there was little to regret <\s>
<s> the state of lord nelson's health i suppose was such that he could not have lived long and the first burst of exultation upon landing in his native country and his reception here would have been dearly bought perhaps by pain and bodily weakness and distress among his friends which he could neither remove nor alleviate <\s>
<s> few men have ever died under circumstances so likely to make their deaths of benefit to their country it is not easy to see what his life could have done comparable to it <\s>
<s> the loss of such men as lord nelson is indeed great and real but surely not for the reason which makes most people grieve a supposition that no other such man is in the country <\s>
<s> the old ballad has taught us how to feel on these occasions i trust i have within my realm five hundred good as he <\s>
<s> but this is the evil that nowhere is merit so much under the power of what to avoid a more serious expression one may call that of fortune as in military and naval service and it is five hundred to one that such men will not have attained situations where they can show themselves so that the country may know in whom to trust <\s>
<s> lord nelson had attained that situation and therefore i think and not for the other reason ought we chiefly to lament that he is taken from us <\s>
<s> pitt is also gone <\s>
<s> by tens of thousands looked upon in like manner as a great loss <\s>
<s> for my own part as probably you know i have never been able to regard his political life with complacency <\s>
<s> i believe him however to have been as disinterested a man and as true a lover of his country as it was possible for so ambitious a man to be <\s>
<s> his first wish though probably unknown to himself was that his country should prosper under his administration his next that it should prosper <\s>
<s> could the order of these wishes have been reversed mr <\s>
<s> pitt would have avoided many of the grievous mistakes into which i think he fell <\s>
<s> i know my dear sir george you will give me credit for speaking without arrogance and i am aware it is not unlikely you may differ greatly from me in these points <\s>
<s> but i like in some things to differ with a friend and that he should know i differ from him it seems to make a more healthy friendship to act as a relief to those notions and feelings which we have in common and to give them a grace and spirit which they could not otherwise possess <\s>
<s> there were some parts in the long letter which i wrote about laying out grounds in which the expression must have been left imperfect <\s>
<s> i like splendid mansions in their proper places and have no objection to large or even obtrusive houses in themselves <\s>
<s> my dislike is to that system of gardening which because a house happens to be large or splendid and stands at the head of a large domain establishes it therefore as a principle that the house ought to dye all the surrounding country with a strength of colouring and to an extent proportionate to its own importance <\s>
<s> this system i think is founded in false taste false feeling and its effects disgusting in the highest degree <\s>
<s> the reason you mention as having induced you to build was worthy of you and gave me the highest pleasure <\s>

<s> my dear lady beaumont though i am to see you so soon i cannot but write a word or two to thank you for the interest you take in my poems as evinced by your solicitude about their immediate reception <\s>

<s> i do not here take into consideration the envy and malevolence and all the bad passions which always stand in the way of a work of any merit from a living poet but merely think of the pure absolute honest ignorance in which all worldlings of every rank and situation must be enveloped with respect to the thoughts feelings and images on which the life of my poems depends <\s>

<s> in a word for i cannot stop to make my way through the hurry of images that present themselves to me what have they to do with endless talking about things nobody cares any thing for except as far as their own vanity is concerned and this with persons they care nothing for but as their vanity or selfishness is concerned what have they to do to say all at once with a life without love <\s>
<s> in such a life there can be no thought for we have no thought save thoughts of pain but as far as we have love and admiration <\s>
<s> it is an awful truth that there neither is nor can be any genuine enjoyment of poetry among nineteen out of twenty of those persons who live or wish to live in the broad light of the world among those who either are or are striving to make themselves people of consideration in society <\s>
<s> this is a truth and an awful one because to be incapable of a feeling of poetry in my sense of the word is to be without love of human nature and reverence for god <\s>
<s> upon this i shall insist elsewhere at present let me confine myself to my object which is to make you my dear friend as easy hearted as myself with respect to these poems <\s>
<s> trouble not yourself upon their present reception of what moment is that compared with what i trust is their destiny to console the afflicted to add sunshine to daylight by making the happy happier to teach the young and the gracious of every age to see to think and feel and therefore to become more actively and securely virtuous this is their office which i trust they will faithfully perform long after we that is all that is mortal of us are mouldered in our graves <\s>
<s> this is an error and has been merely put in upon common rumour <\s>

<s> i am at present and shall be for some time engaged with a sick friend who has come all the way from bristol on purpose to see us and has taken lodgings in the village but should you be unwell again and my company be like to tend in the least to exhilarate you i should like to know that were it in my power to go and see you i might have the liberty to do so <\s>
<s> having such reason to expect coleridge at present were we at liberty in other respects i cannot think of taking my family on tour agreeable to your kind suggestion <\s>
<s> something has however already been added by your means to our comforts in the way of books and probably we shall be able to make an excursion ere the summer be over <\s>
<s> by the bye are you possessed of houbraken and vertue's heads of illustrious persons with anecdotes of their lives by birch <\s>
<s> i had an opportunity of purchasing a handsome copy far below the price at which it now sells i believe in london at penrith a few weeks ago and if you have not a copy and think the work has any merit you would please me greatly by giving it a place in your library <\s>
<s> i am glad you like the passage in madoc about llewellyn <\s>
<s> southey's mind does not seem strong enough to draw the picture of a hero <\s>
<s> the character of madoc is often very insipid and contemptible for instance when he is told that the foemen have surprised caer madoc and of course he has reason to believe butchered or carried away all the women and children what does the author make him do <\s>
<s> think of goervyl and llayan very tenderly forsooth but not a word about his people <\s>
<s> in short according to my notion the character is throughout languidly conceived and as you observe the contrast between her and llewellyn makes him look very mean <\s>
<s> i made a mistake when i pointed out a beautiful passage as being in the beginning of the meeting of the bards it occurs before and ends thus his eyes were closed his head as if in reverence to receive the inspiration bent and as he raised his glowing countenance and brighter eye and swept with passionate hands the ringing harp <\s>
<s> the verses of your ancestor francis beaumont the younger are very elegant and harmonious and written with true feeling <\s>

<s> there are some pleasing verses i think by corbet bishop of norwich on the death of francis beaumont the elder <\s>
<s> they end i remember thus alluding to his short life by whose sole death appears wit's a disease consumes men in few years <\s>
<s> i have never seen the works of the brother of the dramatic poet but i know he wrote a poem upon the battle of bosworth field <\s>

<s> i do not here take into consideration the envy and malevolence and all the bad passions which always stand in the way of a work of any merit from a living poet but merely think of the pure absolute honest ignorance in which all worldlings of every rank and situation must be enveloped with respect to the thoughts feelings and images on which the life of my poems depends <\s>

<s> in a word for i cannot stop to make my way through the hurry of images that present themselves to me what have they to do with endless talking about things nobody cares any thing for except as far as their own vanity is concerned and this with persons they care nothing for but as their vanity or selfishness is concerned what have they to do to say all at once with a life without love <\s>
<s> in such a life there can be no thought for we have no thought save thoughts of pain but as far as we have love and admiration <\s>

<s> this is a truth and an awful one because to be incapable of a feeling of poetry in my sense of the word is to be without love of human nature and reverence for god <\s>
<s> upon this i shall insist elsewhere at present let me confine myself to my object which is to make you my dear friend as easy hearted as myself with respect to these poems <\s>

<s> my dear lady beaumont though i am to see you so soon i cannot but write a word or two to thank you for the interest you take in my poems as evinced by your solicitude about their immediate reception <\s>

<s> in a word for i cannot stop to make my way through the hurry of images that present themselves to me what have they to do with endless talking about things nobody cares any thing for except as far as their own vanity is concerned and this with persons they care nothing for but as their vanity or selfishness is concerned what have they to do to say all at once with a life without love <\s>
<s> in such a life there can be no thought for we have no thought save thoughts of pain but as far as we have love and admiration <\s>

<s> upon this i shall insist elsewhere at present let me confine myself to my object which is to make you my dear friend as easy hearted as myself with respect to these poems <\s>

<s> letter to sir george h <\s>
<s> my dear sir george upon opening this letter you must have seen that it is accompanied with a copy of verses 29 i hope they will give you some pleasure as it will be the best way in which they can repay me for a little vexation of which they have been the cause <\s>
<s> they were written several weeks ago and i wished to send them to you but could not muster up resolution as i felt that they were so unworthy of the subject <\s>
<s> accordingly i kept them by me from week to week with a hope which has proved vain that in some happy moment a new fit of inspiration would help me to mend them and hence my silence which with your usual goodness i know you will excuse <\s>
<s> 29 the happy warrior you will find that the verses are allusive to lord nelson and they will show that i must have sympathised with you in admiration of the man and sorrow for our loss <\s>
<s> yet considering the matter coolly there was little to regret <\s>
<s> the state of lord nelson's health i suppose was such that he could not have lived long and the first burst of exultation upon landing in his native country and his reception here would have been dearly bought perhaps by pain and bodily weakness and distress among his friends which he could neither remove nor alleviate <\s>
<s> few men have ever died under circumstances so likely to make their deaths of benefit to their country it is not easy to see what his life could have done comparable to it <\s>
<s> the loss of such men as lord nelson is indeed great and real but surely not for the reason which makes most people grieve a supposition that no other such man is in the country <\s>
<s> the old ballad has taught us how to feel on these occasions i trust i have within my realm five hundred good as he <\s>
<s> but this is the evil that nowhere is merit so much under the power of what to avoid a more serious expression one may call that of fortune as in military and naval service and it is five hundred to one that such men will not have attained situations where they can show themselves so that the country may know in whom to trust <\s>
<s> lord nelson had attained that situation and therefore i think and not for the other reason ought we chiefly to lament that he is taken from us <\s>
<s> pitt is also gone <\s>
<s> by tens of thousands looked upon in like manner as a great loss <\s>
<s> for my own part as probably you know i have never been able to regard his political life with complacency <\s>
<s> i believe him however to have been as disinterested a man and as true a lover of his country as it was possible for so ambitious a man to be <\s>
<s> his first wish though probably unknown to himself was that his country should prosper under his administration his next that it should prosper <\s>
<s> could the order of these wishes have been reversed mr <\s>
<s> pitt would have avoided many of the grievous mistakes into which i think he fell <\s>
<s> i know my dear sir george you will give me credit for speaking without arrogance and i am aware it is not unlikely you may differ greatly from me in these points <\s>
<s> but i like in some things to differ with a friend and that he should know i differ from him it seems to make a more healthy friendship to act as a relief to those notions and feelings which we have in common and to give them a grace and spirit which they could not otherwise possess <\s>
<s> there were some parts in the long letter which i wrote about laying out grounds in which the expression must have been left imperfect <\s>
<s> i like splendid mansions in their proper places and have no objection to large or even obtrusive houses in themselves <\s>
<s> my dislike is to that system of gardening which because a house happens to be large or splendid and stands at the head of a large domain establishes it therefore as a principle that the house ought to dye all the surrounding country with a strength of colouring and to an extent proportionate to its own importance <\s>
<s> this system i think is founded in false taste false feeling and its effects disgusting in the highest degree <\s>

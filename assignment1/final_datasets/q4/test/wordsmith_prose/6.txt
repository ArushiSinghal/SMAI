<s> nor ever has a good and loyal man such a swell of mind such a clear insight into the constitution of virtue and such a sublime sense of its power as at the first tidings of some atrocious act of perfidy when having taken the alarm for human nature a second thought recovers him and his faith returns gladsome from what has been revealed within himself and awful from participation of the secrets in the profaner grove of humanity which that momentary blast laid open to his view <\s>
<s> of the ultimate independence of the spanish nation there is no reason to doubt and for the immediate furtherance of the good cause and a throwing off of the yoke upon the first favourable opportunity by the different tracts of the country upon which it has been re imposed nothing is wanting but sincerity on the part of the government towards the provinces which are yet free <\s>

<s> this with clue patience and foresight may for the most part be amicably effected without the intervention of conquest but even should a violent course have been resorted to and have proved successful the result will be matter of congratulation rather than of regret if the countries have been incorporated with an equitable participation of natural advantages and civil privileges <\s>

<s> the peninsula cannot be protected but by itself it is too large a tree to be framed by nature for a station among underwoods it must have power to toss its branches in the wind and lift a bold forehead to the sun <\s>
<s> allowing that the regni novitas should either compel or tempt the usurper to do away some ancient abuses and to accord certain insignificant privileges to the people upon the purlieus of the forest of freedom for assuredly he will never suffer them to enter the body of it ); allowing this and much more that the mass of the population would be placed in a condition outwardly more thriving would be better off as the phrase in conversation is ); it is still true that in the act and consciousness of submission to an imposed lord and master to a will not growing out of themselves to the edicts of another people their triumphant enemy there would be the loss of a sensation within for which nothing external even though it should come close to the garden and the field to the door and the fire side can make amends <\s>
<s> the artisan and the merchant men of classes perhaps least attached to their native soil would not be insensible to this loss and the mariner in his thoughtful mood would sadden under it upon the wide ocean <\s>
<s> the central or cardinal feeling of these thoughts may at a future time furnish fit matter for the genius of some patriotic spaniard to express in his own noble language as an inscription for the sword of francis the first if that sword which was so ingloriously and perfidiously surrendered should ever by the energies of liberty be recovered and deposited in its ancient habitation in the escurial <\s>
<s> the patriot will recollect that if the memorial then given up by the hand of the government had also been abandoned by the heart of the people and that indignity patiently subscribed to his country would have been lost for ever <\s>
<s> there are multitudes by whom i know these sentiments will not be languidly received at this day and sure i am that a hundred and fifty years ago they would have been ardently welcomed by all <\s>
<s> but in many parts of europe and especially in our own country men have been pressing forward for some time in a path which has betrayed by its fruitfulness furnishing them constant employment for picking up things about their feet when thoughts were perishing in their minds <\s>
<s> while mechanic arts manufactures agriculture commerce and all those products of knowledge which are confined to gross definite and tangible objects have with the aid of experimental philosophy been every day putting on more brilliant colours the splendour of the imagination has been fading sensibility which was formerly a generous nursling of rude nature has been chased from its ancient range in the wide domain of patriotism and religion with the weapons of derision by a shadow calling itself good sense calculations of presumptuous expediency groping its way among partial and temporary consequences have been substituted for the dictates of paramount and infallible conscience the supreme embracer of consequences lifeless and circumspect decencies have banished the graceful negligence and unsuspicious dignity of virtue <\s>
<s> the progress of these arts also by furnishing such attractive stores of outward accommodation has misled the higher orders of society in their more disinterested exertions for the service of the lower <\s>
<s> animal comforts have been rejoiced over as if they were the end of being <\s>
<s> a neater and more fertile garden a greener field implements and utensils more apt a dwelling more commodious and better furnished let these be attained say the actively benevolent and we are sure not only of being in the right road but of having successfully terminated our journey <\s>
<s> now a country may advance for some time in this course with apparent profit these accommodations by zealous encouragement may be attained and still the peasant or artisan their master be a slave in mind a slave rendered even more abject by the very tenure under which these possessions are held and if they veil from us this fact or reconcile us to it they are worse than worthless <\s>
<s> the springs of emotion may be relaxed or destroyed within him he may have little thought of the past and less interest in the future the great end and difficulty of life for men of all classes and especially difficult for those who live by manual labour is a union of peace with innocent and laudable animation <\s>
<s> not by bread alone is the life of man sustained not by raiment alone is he warmed but by the genial and vernal inmate of the breast which at once pushes forth and cherishes by self support and self sufficing endeavours by anticipations apprehensions and active remembrances by elasticity under insult and firm resistance to injury by joy and by love by pride which his imagination gathers in from afar by patience because life wants not promises by admiration by gratitude which debasing him not when his fellow being is its object habitually expands itself for his elevation in complacency towards his creator <\s>
<s> now to the existence of these blessings national independence is indispensible and many of them it will itself produce and maintain <\s>
<s> for it is some consolation to those who look back upon the history of the world to know that even without civil liberty society may possess diffused through its inner recesses in the minds even of its humblest members something of dignified enjoyment <\s>
<s> but without national independence this is impossible <\s>
<s> the difference between inbred oppression and that which is from without is essential inasmuch as the former does not exclude from the minds of a people the feeling of being self governed does not imply as the latter does when patiently submitted to an abandonment of the first duty imposed by the faculty of reason <\s>
<s> in reality where this feeling has no place a people are not a society but a herd man being indeed distinguished among them from the brute but only to his disgrace <\s>
<s> i am aware that there are too many who think that to the bulk of the community this independence is of no value that it is a refinement with which they feel they have no concern inasmuch as under the best frame of government there is an inevitable dependence of the pool upon the rich of the many upon the few so unrelenting and imperious as to reduce this other by comparison into a force which has small influence and is entitled to no regard <\s>
<s> superadd civil liberty to national independence and this position is overthrown at once for there is no more certain mark of a sound frame of polity than this that in all individual instances and it is upon these generalized that this position is laid down the dependence is in reality far more strict on the side of the wealthy and the labouring man leans less upon others than any man in the community but the case before us is of a country not internally free yet supposed capable of repelling an external enemy who attempts its subjugation <\s>
<s> if a country have put on chains of its own forging in the name of virtue let it be conscious that to itself it is accountable let it not have cause to look beyond its own limits for reproof and in the name of humanity if it be self depressed let it have its pride and some hope within itself <\s>

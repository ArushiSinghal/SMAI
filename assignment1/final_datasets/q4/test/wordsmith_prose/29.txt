<s> of these selections the author wrote as follows to professor reed of philadelphia there has recently been published in london a volume of some of chaucer's tales and poems modernised <\s>
<s> this little specimen originated in what i attempted with the prioress's tale and if the book should find its way to america you will see in it two further specimens from myself <\s>

<s> leigh hunt has not failed in the manciple's tale which i myself modernised many years ago but though i much admire the genius of chaucer as displayed in this performance i could not place my version at the disposal of the editor as i deemed the subject somewhat too indelicate for pure taste to be offered to the world at this time of day <\s>
<s> horne has much hurt this publication by not abstaining from the reve's tale this after making all allowance for the rude manners of chaucer's age is intolerable and by indispensably softening down the incidents he has killed the spirit of that humour gross and farcical that pervades the original <\s>
<s> when the work was first mentioned to me i protested as strongly as possible against admitting any coarseness or indelicacy so that my conscience is clear of countenancing aught of that kind <\s>
<s> so great is my admiration of chaucer's genius and so profound my reverence for him as an instrument in the hands of providence for spreading the light of literature through his native land that notwithstanding the defects and faults in this publication i am glad of it as a mean for making many acquainted with the original who would otherwise be ignorant of everything about him but his name 9 9 extract january 13th 1841 memoirs ii <\s>

<s> in the following poem no further deviation from the original has been made than was necessary for the fluent reading and instant understanding of the author so much however is the language altered since chaucer's time especially in pronunciation that much was to be removed and its place supplied with as little incongruity as possible <\s>

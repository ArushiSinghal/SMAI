<s> selections from chaucer modernised <\s>
<s> of the volume in which the selections appeared <\s>
<s> of these selections the author wrote as follows to professor reed of philadelphia there has recently been published in london a volume of some of chaucer's tales and poems modernised <\s>
<s> this little specimen originated in what i attempted with the prioress's tale and if the book should find its way to america you will see in it two further specimens from myself <\s>
<s> i had no further connection with the publication than by making a present of these to one of the contributors <\s>
<s> let me however recommend to your notice the prologue and the franklin's tale they are both by mr <\s>
<s> horne a gentleman unknown to me but are the latter in particular very well done <\s>
<s> leigh hunt has not failed in the manciple's tale which i myself modernised many years ago but though i much admire the genius of chaucer as displayed in this performance i could not place my version at the disposal of the editor as i deemed the subject somewhat too indelicate for pure taste to be offered to the world at this time of day <\s>
<s> horne has much hurt this publication by not abstaining from the reve's tale this after making all allowance for the rude manners of chaucer's age is intolerable and by indispensably softening down the incidents he has killed the spirit of that humour gross and farcical that pervades the original <\s>
<s> when the work was first mentioned to me i protested as strongly as possible against admitting any coarseness or indelicacy so that my conscience is clear of countenancing aught of that kind <\s>
<s> so great is my admiration of chaucer's genius and so profound my reverence for him as an instrument in the hands of providence for spreading the light of literature through his native land that notwithstanding the defects and faults in this publication i am glad of it as a mean for making many acquainted with the original who would otherwise be ignorant of everything about him but his name 9 9 extract january 13th 1841 memoirs ii <\s>
<s> call up him who left half told the story of cambuscan bold <\s>
<s> in the following poem no further deviation from the original has been made than was necessary for the fluent reading and instant understanding of the author so much however is the language altered since chaucer's time especially in pronunciation that much was to be removed and its place supplied with as little incongruity as possible <\s>
<s> the ancient accent has been retained in a few conjunctions as alsò and alw?y from a conviction that such sprinklings of antiquity would be admitted by persons of taste to have a graceful accordance with the subject <\s>
<s> the fierce bigotry of the prioress forms a fine back ground for her tender hearted sympathies with the mother and child and the mode in which the story is told amply atones for the extravagance of the miracle <\s>

<s> the old cumberland beggar <\s>
<s> i the class of beggars to which the old man here described belongs will probably soon be extinct <\s>
<s> it consisted of poor and mostly old and infirm persons who confined themselves to a stated round in their neighbourhood and had certain fixed days on which at different houses they regularly received alms sometimes in money but mostly in provisions <\s>
<s> ibid observed and with great benefit to my own heart when i was a child <\s>
<s> written at racedown and alfoxden in my 23d year <\s>
<s> the political economists were about that time beginning their war upon mendicity in all its forms and by implication if not directly on alms giving also <\s>
<s> this heartless process has been carried as far as it can go by the amended poor law bill tho the inhumanity that prevails in this measure is somewhat disguised by the profession that one of its objects is to throw the poor upon the voluntary donations of their neighbours that is if rightly interpreted to force them into a condition between relief in the union poor house and alms robbed of their christian grace and spirit as being forced rather from the avaricious and selfish and all in fact but the humane and charitable are at liberty to keep all they possess from their distressed brethren <\s>
<s> the farmer of tilsbury vale <\s>
<s> with this picture which was taken from real life compare the imaginative one of the reverie of poor susan and see to make up the deficiencies of the class the excursion passim <\s>
<s> ibid the character of this man was described to me and the incident upon which the verses turn was told me by mr <\s>
<s> pool of nether stowey with whom i became acquainted through our common friend s t c <\s>
<s> during my residence at alfoxden i used to see a great deal of him and had frequent occasions to admire the course of his daily life especially his conduct to his labourers and poor neighbours <\s>
<s> their virtues he carefully encouraged and weighed their faults in the scales of charity <\s>
<s> if i seem in these verses to have treated the weaknesses of the farmer and his transgression too tenderly it may in part be ascribed to my having received the story from one so averse to all harsh judgment <\s>
<s> after his death was found in his escritoir a lock of gray hair carefully preserved with a notice that it had been cut from the head of his faithful shepherd who had served him for a length of years <\s>
<s> i need scarcely add that he felt for all men as brothers <\s>
<s> he was much beloved by distinguished persons mr <\s>
<s> davy and many others and in his own neighbourhood was highly valued as a magistrate a man of business and in every other social relation <\s>

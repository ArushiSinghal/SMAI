<s> but though i have called it a thanksgiving ode strictly speaking it is not so but a poem composed or supposed to be composed on the morning of the thanksgiving uttering the sentiments of an individual upon that occasion <\s>
<s> it is a dramatised ejaculation and this if any thing can must excuse the irregular frame of the metre <\s>
<s> in respect to a stanza for a grand subject designed to be treated comprehensively there are great objections <\s>
<s> if the stanza be short it will scarcely allow of fervour and impetuosity unless so short as that the sense is run perpetually from one stanza to another as in horace's alcaics and if it be long it will be as apt to generate diffuseness as to check it <\s>
<s> of this we have innumerable instances in spenser and the italian poets <\s>
<s> the sense required cannot he included in one given stanza so that another whole stanza is added not unfrequently for the sake of matter which would naturally include itself in a very few lines <\s>

<s> be so good as to let me know where you found most difficulty in following me <\s>

<s> letter to robert southey <\s>
<s> dear southey my opinion in respect to epic poetry is much the same as the critic whom lucien buonaparte has quoted in his preface <\s>
<s> epic poetry of the highest class requires in the first place an action eminently influential an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man what the critics i believe call machinery and lastly i think with dennis that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry <\s>
<s> now tasso's is a religious subject and in my opinion a most happy one but i am confidently of opinion that the movement of tasso's poem rarely corresponds with the essential character of the subject nor do i think it possible that written in stanzas it should <\s>
<s> the celestial movement cannot i think be kept up if the sense is to be broken in that despotic manner at the close of every eight lines <\s>
<s> spenser's stanza is infinitely finer than the ottaca rhima but even spenser's will not allow the epic movement as exhibited by homer virgil and milton <\s>
<s> how noble is the first paragraph of the aeneid in point of sound compared with the first stanza of the jerusalem delivered <\s>

<s> about this time wordsworth's attention was given to the education of his eldest son this occupation appears to have been the occasion of their composition <\s>
<s> in preparing his son for his university career he reperused the principal latin poets and doubtless the careful study of their works was not without a beneficial influence on his own <\s>
<s> it imparted variety and richness to his conceptions and shed new graces on his style and rescued his poems from the charge of mannerism <\s>
<s> among the fruits of this course of reading was a translation of some of the earlier books of virgil's aeneid <\s>
<s> three books were finished <\s>
<s> this version was not executed in blank verse but in rhyme not however in the style of pope but with greater freedom and vigour <\s>
<s> a specimen of this translation was contributed by wordsworth to the philological museum printed at cambridge in 1832 [8 0 it was accompanied with the following letter from the author translation of part of the first book of the aeneid [8 1 to the editor off the philological museum <\s>
<s> your letter reminding me of an expectation i some time since held out to you of allowing some specimens of my translation from the aeneid to be printed in the philological museum was not very acceptable for i had abandoned the thought of ever sending into the world any part of that experiment for it was nothing more an experiment begun for amusement and i now think a less fortunate one than when i first named it to you <\s>
<s> having been displeased in modern translations with the additions of incongruous matter i began to translate with a resolve to keep clear of that fault by adding nothing but i became convinced that a spirited translation can scarcely be accomplished in the english language without admitting a principle of compensation <\s>

<s> i have made so much progress with the second book that i defer sending the former till that is finished <\s>

<s> my lord i am truly obliged by your friendly and frank communication <\s>
<s> may i beg that you would add to the favour by marking with a pencil some of the passages that are faulty in your view of the case <\s>
<s> we seem pretty much of opinion upon the subject of rhyme <\s>
<s> pentameters where the sense has a close of some sort at every two lines may be rendered in regularly closed couplets but hexameters especially the virgilian that run the lines into each other for a great length cannot <\s>
<s> i have long been persuaded that milton formed his blank verse upon the model of the georgics and the aeneid and i am so much struck with this resemblance that i should have attempted virgil in blank verse had i not been persuaded that no ancient author can be with advantage so rendered <\s>
<s> their religion their warfare their course of action and feeling are too remote from modern interest to allow it <\s>
<s> we require every possible help and attraction of sound in our language to smooth the way for the admission of things so remote from our present concerns <\s>
<s> my own notion of translation is that it cannot be too literal provided three faults be avoided baldness in which i include all that takes from dignity and strangeness or uncouthness including harshness and lastly attempts to convey meanings which as they cannot be given but by languid circumlocutions cannot in fact be said to be given at all <\s>

<s> i was unable to get the meaning with tolerable harmony into fewer words which are more than to a modern reader perhaps it is worth <\s>
<s> i feel much at a loss without the assistance of the marks which i have requested to take an exact measure of your lordship's feelings with regard to the diction <\s>
<s> to save you the trouble of reference i will transcribe two passages from dryden first the celebrated appearance of hector's ghost to aeneas <\s>

<s> do we behold thee wearied as we are with length of labours and with toils of war <\s>
<s> after so many funerals of thy own art thou restored to thy declining town <\s>
<s> this i think not an unfavourable specimen of dryden's way of treating the solemnly pathetic passages <\s>
<s> yet surely here is nothing of the cadence of the original and little of its spirit <\s>
<s> the second verse is not in the original and ought not to have been in dryden for it anticipates the beautiful hemistich sat patriae priamoque datum <\s>
<s> by the by there is the same sort of anticipation in a spirited and harmonious couplet preceding such as he was when by pelides slain thessalian coursers dragged him o'er the plain <\s>
<s> this introduction of pelides here is not in virgil because it would have prevented the effect of redit exuvias indutus achillei <\s>

<s> epic poetry of the highest class requires in the first place an action eminently influential an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man what the critics i believe call machinery and lastly i think with dennis that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry <\s>

<s> letter to robert southey <\s>
<s> dear southey my opinion in respect to epic poetry is much the same as the critic whom lucien buonaparte has quoted in his preface <\s>
<s> epic poetry of the highest class requires in the first place an action eminently influential an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man what the critics i believe call machinery and lastly i think with dennis that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry <\s>
<s> now tasso's is a religious subject and in my opinion a most happy one but i am confidently of opinion that the movement of tasso's poem rarely corresponds with the essential character of the subject nor do i think it possible that written in stanzas it should <\s>
<s> the celestial movement cannot i think be kept up if the sense is to be broken in that despotic manner at the close of every eight lines <\s>
<s> spenser's stanza is infinitely finer than the ottaca rhima but even spenser's will not allow the epic movement as exhibited by homer virgil and milton <\s>
<s> how noble is the first paragraph of the aeneid in point of sound compared with the first stanza of the jerusalem delivered <\s>

<s> in preparing his son for his university career he reperused the principal latin poets and doubtless the careful study of their works was not without a beneficial influence on his own <\s>

<s> your letter reminding me of an expectation i some time since held out to you of allowing some specimens of my translation from the aeneid to be printed in the philological museum was not very acceptable for i had abandoned the thought of ever sending into the world any part of that experiment for it was nothing more an experiment begun for amusement and i now think a less fortunate one than when i first named it to you <\s>

<s> epic poetry of the highest class requires in the first place an action eminently influential an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man what the critics i believe call machinery and lastly i think with dennis that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry <\s>
<s> now tasso's is a religious subject and in my opinion a most happy one but i am confidently of opinion that the movement of tasso's poem rarely corresponds with the essential character of the subject nor do i think it possible that written in stanzas it should <\s>
<s> the celestial movement cannot i think be kept up if the sense is to be broken in that despotic manner at the close of every eight lines <\s>
<s> spenser's stanza is infinitely finer than the ottaca rhima but even spenser's will not allow the epic movement as exhibited by homer virgil and milton <\s>
<s> how noble is the first paragraph of the aeneid in point of sound compared with the first stanza of the jerusalem delivered <\s>
<s> the one winds with the majesty of the conscript fathers entering the senate house in solemn procession and the other has the pace of a set of recruits shuffling on the drill ground and receiving from the adjutant or drill serjeant the commands to halt at every ten or twenty steps <\s>

<s> your letter reminding me of an expectation i some time since held out to you of allowing some specimens of my translation from the aeneid to be printed in the philological museum was not very acceptable for i had abandoned the thought of ever sending into the world any part of that experiment for it was nothing more an experiment begun for amusement and i now think a less fortunate one than when i first named it to you <\s>

<s> dear sir though my sister during my absence has returned thanks in my name for the verses which you have done me the honour of addressing to me and for the obliging letter which accompanies them i feel it incumbent on me on my return home to write a few words to the same purpose with my own hand <\s>
<s> it is always a satisfaction to me to learn that i have given pleasure upon rational grounds and i have nothing to object to your poetical panegyric but the occasion which called it forth <\s>
<s> an admirer of my works zealous as you have declared yourself to be condescends too much when he gives way to an impulse proceeding from the or indeed from any other review <\s>
<s> the writers in these publications while they prosecute their inglorious employment cannot be supposed to be in a state of mind very favourable for being affected by the finer influences of a thing so pure as genuine poetry and as to the instance which has incited you to offer me this tribute of your gratitude though i have not seen it i doubt not but that it is a splenetic effusion of the conductor of that review who has taken a perpetual retainer from his own incapacity to plead against my claims to public approbation <\s>
<s> i differ from you in thinking that the only poetical lines in your address are stolen from myself <\s>

<s> it pleases though it does not surprise me to learn that having been affected early in life by my verses you have returned again to your old loves after some little infidelities which you were shamed into by commerce with the scribbling and chattering part of the world <\s>
<s> i have heard of many who upon their first acquaintance with my poetry have had much to get over before they could thoroughly relish it but never of one who having once learned to enjoy it had ceased to value it or survived his admiration <\s>

<s> of the thanksgiving ode and white doe of rylston letter to robert southey <\s>
<s> my dear southey i am much of your mind in respect to my ode <\s>
<s> had it been a hymn uttering the sentiments of a multitude a stanza would have been indispensable <\s>
<s> but though i have called it a thanksgiving ode strictly speaking it is not so but a poem composed or supposed to be composed on the morning of the thanksgiving uttering the sentiments of an individual upon that occasion <\s>
<s> it is a dramatised ejaculation and this if any thing can must excuse the irregular frame of the metre <\s>
<s> in respect to a stanza for a grand subject designed to be treated comprehensively there are great objections <\s>
<s> if the stanza be short it will scarcely allow of fervour and impetuosity unless so short as that the sense is run perpetually from one stanza to another as in horace's alcaics and if it be long it will be as apt to generate diffuseness as to check it <\s>
<s> of this we have innumerable instances in spenser and the italian poets <\s>
<s> the sense required cannot he included in one given stanza so that another whole stanza is added not unfrequently for the sake of matter which would naturally include itself in a very few lines <\s>
<s> if gray's plan be adopted there is not time to become acquainted with the arrangement and to recognise with pleasure the recurrence of the movement <\s>
<s> be so good as to let me know where you found most difficulty in following me <\s>
<s> the passage which i most suspect of being misunderstood is and thus is missed the sole true glory and the passage where i doubt most about the reasonableness of expecting that the reader should follow me in the luxuriance of the imagery and the language is the one that describes under so many metaphors the spreading of the news of the waterloo victory over the globe <\s>
<s> tell me if this displeased you <\s>
<s> do you know who reviewed the white doe in the quarterly <\s>
<s> after having asserted that mr <\s>
<s> uses his words without any regard to their sense the writer says that on no other principle can he explain that emily is always called the consecrated emily <\s>
<s> now the name emily occurs just fifteen times in the poem and out of these fifteen the epithet is attached to it once and that for the express purpose of recalling the scene in which she had been consecrated by her brother's solemn adjuration that she would fulfil her destiny and become a soul by force of sorrows high uplifted to the purest sky of undisturbed mortality <\s>
<s> the point upon which the whole moral interest of the piece hinges when that speech is closed occurs in this line he kissed the consecrated maid and to bring back this to the reader i repeated the epithet <\s>

<s> letter to robert southey <\s>
<s> dear southey my opinion in respect to epic poetry is much the same as the critic whom lucien buonaparte has quoted in his preface <\s>
<s> epic poetry of the highest class requires in the first place an action eminently influential an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man what the critics i believe call machinery and lastly i think with dennis that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry <\s>
<s> now tasso's is a religious subject and in my opinion a most happy one but i am confidently of opinion that the movement of tasso's poem rarely corresponds with the essential character of the subject nor do i think it possible that written in stanzas it should <\s>
<s> the celestial movement cannot i think be kept up if the sense is to be broken in that despotic manner at the close of every eight lines <\s>
<s> spenser's stanza is infinitely finer than the ottaca rhima but even spenser's will not allow the epic movement as exhibited by homer virgil and milton <\s>
<s> how noble is the first paragraph of the aeneid in point of sound compared with the first stanza of the jerusalem delivered <\s>

<s> in preparing his son for his university career he reperused the principal latin poets and doubtless the careful study of their works was not without a beneficial influence on his own <\s>

<s> dear southey my opinion in respect to epic poetry is much the same as the critic whom lucien buonaparte has quoted in his preface <\s>
<s> epic poetry of the highest class requires in the first place an action eminently influential an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man what the critics i believe call machinery and lastly i think with dennis that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry <\s>
<s> now tasso's is a religious subject and in my opinion a most happy one but i am confidently of opinion that the movement of tasso's poem rarely corresponds with the essential character of the subject nor do i think it possible that written in stanzas it should <\s>
<s> the celestial movement cannot i think be kept up if the sense is to be broken in that despotic manner at the close of every eight lines <\s>
<s> spenser's stanza is infinitely finer than the ottaca rhima but even spenser's will not allow the epic movement as exhibited by homer virgil and milton <\s>

<s> my dear southey i am much of your mind in respect to my ode <\s>
<s> had it been a hymn uttering the sentiments of a multitude a stanza would have been indispensable <\s>
<s> but though i have called it a thanksgiving ode strictly speaking it is not so but a poem composed or supposed to be composed on the morning of the thanksgiving uttering the sentiments of an individual upon that occasion <\s>
<s> it is a dramatised ejaculation and this if any thing can must excuse the irregular frame of the metre <\s>
<s> in respect to a stanza for a grand subject designed to be treated comprehensively there are great objections <\s>
<s> if the stanza be short it will scarcely allow of fervour and impetuosity unless so short as that the sense is run perpetually from one stanza to another as in horace's alcaics and if it be long it will be as apt to generate diffuseness as to check it <\s>
<s> of this we have innumerable instances in spenser and the italian poets <\s>
<s> the sense required cannot he included in one given stanza so that another whole stanza is added not unfrequently for the sake of matter which would naturally include itself in a very few lines <\s>
<s> if gray's plan be adopted there is not time to become acquainted with the arrangement and to recognise with pleasure the recurrence of the movement <\s>
<s> be so good as to let me know where you found most difficulty in following me <\s>
<s> the passage which i most suspect of being misunderstood is and thus is missed the sole true glory and the passage where i doubt most about the reasonableness of expecting that the reader should follow me in the luxuriance of the imagery and the language is the one that describes under so many metaphors the spreading of the news of the waterloo victory over the globe <\s>

<s> letter to robert southey <\s>
<s> dear southey my opinion in respect to epic poetry is much the same as the critic whom lucien buonaparte has quoted in his preface <\s>
<s> epic poetry of the highest class requires in the first place an action eminently influential an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man what the critics i believe call machinery and lastly i think with dennis that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry <\s>
<s> now tasso's is a religious subject and in my opinion a most happy one but i am confidently of opinion that the movement of tasso's poem rarely corresponds with the essential character of the subject nor do i think it possible that written in stanzas it should <\s>
<s> the celestial movement cannot i think be kept up if the sense is to be broken in that despotic manner at the close of every eight lines <\s>
<s> spenser's stanza is infinitely finer than the ottaca rhima but even spenser's will not allow the epic movement as exhibited by homer virgil and milton <\s>
<s> how noble is the first paragraph of the aeneid in point of sound compared with the first stanza of the jerusalem delivered <\s>
<s> the one winds with the majesty of the conscript fathers entering the senate house in solemn procession and the other has the pace of a set of recruits shuffling on the drill ground and receiving from the adjutant or drill serjeant the commands to halt at every ten or twenty steps <\s>

<s> about this time wordsworth's attention was given to the education of his eldest son this occupation appears to have been the occasion of their composition <\s>
<s> in preparing his son for his university career he reperused the principal latin poets and doubtless the careful study of their works was not without a beneficial influence on his own <\s>
<s> it imparted variety and richness to his conceptions and shed new graces on his style and rescued his poems from the charge of mannerism <\s>
<s> among the fruits of this course of reading was a translation of some of the earlier books of virgil's aeneid <\s>
<s> three books were finished <\s>
<s> this version was not executed in blank verse but in rhyme not however in the style of pope but with greater freedom and vigour <\s>
<s> a specimen of this translation was contributed by wordsworth to the philological museum printed at cambridge in 1832 [8 0 it was accompanied with the following letter from the author translation of part of the first book of the aeneid [8 1 to the editor off the philological museum <\s>
<s> your letter reminding me of an expectation i some time since held out to you of allowing some specimens of my translation from the aeneid to be printed in the philological museum was not very acceptable for i had abandoned the thought of ever sending into the world any part of that experiment for it was nothing more an experiment begun for amusement and i now think a less fortunate one than when i first named it to you <\s>

<s> had it been a hymn uttering the sentiments of a multitude a stanza would have been indispensable <\s>
<s> but though i have called it a thanksgiving ode strictly speaking it is not so but a poem composed or supposed to be composed on the morning of the thanksgiving uttering the sentiments of an individual upon that occasion <\s>
<s> it is a dramatised ejaculation and this if any thing can must excuse the irregular frame of the metre <\s>
<s> in respect to a stanza for a grand subject designed to be treated comprehensively there are great objections <\s>
<s> if the stanza be short it will scarcely allow of fervour and impetuosity unless so short as that the sense is run perpetually from one stanza to another as in horace's alcaics and if it be long it will be as apt to generate diffuseness as to check it <\s>
<s> of this we have innumerable instances in spenser and the italian poets <\s>
<s> the sense required cannot he included in one given stanza so that another whole stanza is added not unfrequently for the sake of matter which would naturally include itself in a very few lines <\s>
<s> if gray's plan be adopted there is not time to become acquainted with the arrangement and to recognise with pleasure the recurrence of the movement <\s>
<s> be so good as to let me know where you found most difficulty in following me <\s>
<s> the passage which i most suspect of being misunderstood is and thus is missed the sole true glory and the passage where i doubt most about the reasonableness of expecting that the reader should follow me in the luxuriance of the imagery and the language is the one that describes under so many metaphors the spreading of the news of the waterloo victory over the globe <\s>

<s> dear southey my opinion in respect to epic poetry is much the same as the critic whom lucien buonaparte has quoted in his preface <\s>
<s> epic poetry of the highest class requires in the first place an action eminently influential an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man what the critics i believe call machinery and lastly i think with dennis that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry <\s>
<s> now tasso's is a religious subject and in my opinion a most happy one but i am confidently of opinion that the movement of tasso's poem rarely corresponds with the essential character of the subject nor do i think it possible that written in stanzas it should <\s>
<s> the celestial movement cannot i think be kept up if the sense is to be broken in that despotic manner at the close of every eight lines <\s>
<s> spenser's stanza is infinitely finer than the ottaca rhima but even spenser's will not allow the epic movement as exhibited by homer virgil and milton <\s>

<s> pentameters where the sense has a close of some sort at every two lines may be rendered in regularly closed couplets but hexameters especially the virgilian that run the lines into each other for a great length cannot <\s>
<s> i have long been persuaded that milton formed his blank verse upon the model of the georgics and the aeneid and i am so much struck with this resemblance that i should have attempted virgil in blank verse had i not been persuaded that no ancient author can be with advantage so rendered <\s>
<s> their religion their warfare their course of action and feeling are too remote from modern interest to allow it <\s>
<s> we require every possible help and attraction of sound in our language to smooth the way for the admission of things so remote from our present concerns <\s>
<s> my own notion of translation is that it cannot be too literal provided three faults be avoided baldness in which i include all that takes from dignity and strangeness or uncouthness including harshness and lastly attempts to convey meanings which as they cannot be given but by languid circumlocutions cannot in fact be said to be given at all <\s>

<s> i was unable to get the meaning with tolerable harmony into fewer words which are more than to a modern reader perhaps it is worth <\s>
<s> i feel much at a loss without the assistance of the marks which i have requested to take an exact measure of your lordship's feelings with regard to the diction <\s>
<s> to save you the trouble of reference i will transcribe two passages from dryden first the celebrated appearance of hector's ghost to aeneas <\s>
<s> aeneas thus addresses him o light of trojans and support of troy thy father's champion and thy country s joy o long expected by thy friends from whence art thou returned so late for our defence <\s>
<s> do we behold thee wearied as we are with length of labours and with toils of war <\s>
<s> after so many funerals of thy own art thou restored to thy declining town <\s>
<s> this i think not an unfavourable specimen of dryden's way of treating the solemnly pathetic passages <\s>
<s> yet surely here is nothing of the cadence of the original and little of its spirit <\s>
<s> the second verse is not in the original and ought not to have been in dryden for it anticipates the beautiful hemistich sat patriae priamoque datum <\s>
<s> by the by there is the same sort of anticipation in a spirited and harmonious couplet preceding such as he was when by pelides slain thessalian coursers dragged him o'er the plain <\s>
<s> this introduction of pelides here is not in virgil because it would have prevented the effect of redit exuvias indutus achillei <\s>

<s> my dear southey i am much of your mind in respect to my ode <\s>

<s> but though i have called it a thanksgiving ode strictly speaking it is not so but a poem composed or supposed to be composed on the morning of the thanksgiving uttering the sentiments of an individual upon that occasion <\s>
<s> it is a dramatised ejaculation and this if any thing can must excuse the irregular frame of the metre <\s>
<s> in respect to a stanza for a grand subject designed to be treated comprehensively there are great objections <\s>
<s> if the stanza be short it will scarcely allow of fervour and impetuosity unless so short as that the sense is run perpetually from one stanza to another as in horace's alcaics and if it be long it will be as apt to generate diffuseness as to check it <\s>
<s> of this we have innumerable instances in spenser and the italian poets <\s>
<s> the sense required cannot he included in one given stanza so that another whole stanza is added not unfrequently for the sake of matter which would naturally include itself in a very few lines <\s>
<s> if gray's plan be adopted there is not time to become acquainted with the arrangement and to recognise with pleasure the recurrence of the movement <\s>
<s> be so good as to let me know where you found most difficulty in following me <\s>
<s> the passage which i most suspect of being misunderstood is and thus is missed the sole true glory and the passage where i doubt most about the reasonableness of expecting that the reader should follow me in the luxuriance of the imagery and the language is the one that describes under so many metaphors the spreading of the news of the waterloo victory over the globe <\s>

<s> letter to robert southey <\s>
<s> dear southey my opinion in respect to epic poetry is much the same as the critic whom lucien buonaparte has quoted in his preface <\s>
<s> epic poetry of the highest class requires in the first place an action eminently influential an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man what the critics i believe call machinery and lastly i think with dennis that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry <\s>
<s> now tasso's is a religious subject and in my opinion a most happy one but i am confidently of opinion that the movement of tasso's poem rarely corresponds with the essential character of the subject nor do i think it possible that written in stanzas it should <\s>
<s> the celestial movement cannot i think be kept up if the sense is to be broken in that despotic manner at the close of every eight lines <\s>
<s> spenser's stanza is infinitely finer than the ottaca rhima but even spenser's will not allow the epic movement as exhibited by homer virgil and milton <\s>
<s> how noble is the first paragraph of the aeneid in point of sound compared with the first stanza of the jerusalem delivered <\s>

<s> but though i have called it a thanksgiving ode strictly speaking it is not so but a poem composed or supposed to be composed on the morning of the thanksgiving uttering the sentiments of an individual upon that occasion <\s>
<s> it is a dramatised ejaculation and this if any thing can must excuse the irregular frame of the metre <\s>
<s> in respect to a stanza for a grand subject designed to be treated comprehensively there are great objections <\s>
<s> if the stanza be short it will scarcely allow of fervour and impetuosity unless so short as that the sense is run perpetually from one stanza to another as in horace's alcaics and if it be long it will be as apt to generate diffuseness as to check it <\s>
<s> of this we have innumerable instances in spenser and the italian poets <\s>
<s> the sense required cannot he included in one given stanza so that another whole stanza is added not unfrequently for the sake of matter which would naturally include itself in a very few lines <\s>
<s> if gray's plan be adopted there is not time to become acquainted with the arrangement and to recognise with pleasure the recurrence of the movement <\s>
<s> be so good as to let me know where you found most difficulty in following me <\s>

<s> dear southey my opinion in respect to epic poetry is much the same as the critic whom lucien buonaparte has quoted in his preface <\s>
<s> epic poetry of the highest class requires in the first place an action eminently influential an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man what the critics i believe call machinery and lastly i think with dennis that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry <\s>
<s> now tasso's is a religious subject and in my opinion a most happy one but i am confidently of opinion that the movement of tasso's poem rarely corresponds with the essential character of the subject nor do i think it possible that written in stanzas it should <\s>
<s> the celestial movement cannot i think be kept up if the sense is to be broken in that despotic manner at the close of every eight lines <\s>
<s> spenser's stanza is infinitely finer than the ottaca rhima but even spenser's will not allow the epic movement as exhibited by homer virgil and milton <\s>

<s> but though i have called it a thanksgiving ode strictly speaking it is not so but a poem composed or supposed to be composed on the morning of the thanksgiving uttering the sentiments of an individual upon that occasion <\s>
<s> it is a dramatised ejaculation and this if any thing can must excuse the irregular frame of the metre <\s>
<s> in respect to a stanza for a grand subject designed to be treated comprehensively there are great objections <\s>
<s> if the stanza be short it will scarcely allow of fervour and impetuosity unless so short as that the sense is run perpetually from one stanza to another as in horace's alcaics and if it be long it will be as apt to generate diffuseness as to check it <\s>
<s> of this we have innumerable instances in spenser and the italian poets <\s>
<s> the sense required cannot he included in one given stanza so that another whole stanza is added not unfrequently for the sake of matter which would naturally include itself in a very few lines <\s>

<s> dear southey my opinion in respect to epic poetry is much the same as the critic whom lucien buonaparte has quoted in his preface <\s>
<s> epic poetry of the highest class requires in the first place an action eminently influential an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man what the critics i believe call machinery and lastly i think with dennis that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry <\s>

<s> letter to robert southey <\s>
<s> dear southey my opinion in respect to epic poetry is much the same as the critic whom lucien buonaparte has quoted in his preface <\s>
<s> epic poetry of the highest class requires in the first place an action eminently influential an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man what the critics i believe call machinery and lastly i think with dennis that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry <\s>
<s> now tasso's is a religious subject and in my opinion a most happy one but i am confidently of opinion that the movement of tasso's poem rarely corresponds with the essential character of the subject nor do i think it possible that written in stanzas it should <\s>
<s> the celestial movement cannot i think be kept up if the sense is to be broken in that despotic manner at the close of every eight lines <\s>
<s> spenser's stanza is infinitely finer than the ottaca rhima but even spenser's will not allow the epic movement as exhibited by homer virgil and milton <\s>
<s> how noble is the first paragraph of the aeneid in point of sound compared with the first stanza of the jerusalem delivered <\s>

<s> in preparing his son for his university career he reperused the principal latin poets and doubtless the careful study of their works was not without a beneficial influence on his own <\s>

<s> your letter reminding me of an expectation i some time since held out to you of allowing some specimens of my translation from the aeneid to be printed in the philological museum was not very acceptable for i had abandoned the thought of ever sending into the world any part of that experiment for it was nothing more an experiment begun for amusement and i now think a less fortunate one than when i first named it to you <\s>

<s> epic poetry of the highest class requires in the first place an action eminently influential an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man what the critics i believe call machinery and lastly i think with dennis that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry <\s>
<s> now tasso's is a religious subject and in my opinion a most happy one but i am confidently of opinion that the movement of tasso's poem rarely corresponds with the essential character of the subject nor do i think it possible that written in stanzas it should <\s>
<s> the celestial movement cannot i think be kept up if the sense is to be broken in that despotic manner at the close of every eight lines <\s>
<s> spenser's stanza is infinitely finer than the ottaca rhima but even spenser's will not allow the epic movement as exhibited by homer virgil and milton <\s>
<s> how noble is the first paragraph of the aeneid in point of sound compared with the first stanza of the jerusalem delivered <\s>
<s> the one winds with the majesty of the conscript fathers entering the senate house in solemn procession and the other has the pace of a set of recruits shuffling on the drill ground and receiving from the adjutant or drill serjeant the commands to halt at every ten or twenty steps <\s>

<s> your letter reminding me of an expectation i some time since held out to you of allowing some specimens of my translation from the aeneid to be printed in the philological museum was not very acceptable for i had abandoned the thought of ever sending into the world any part of that experiment for it was nothing more an experiment begun for amusement and i now think a less fortunate one than when i first named it to you <\s>

<s> dear sir though my sister during my absence has returned thanks in my name for the verses which you have done me the honour of addressing to me and for the obliging letter which accompanies them i feel it incumbent on me on my return home to write a few words to the same purpose with my own hand <\s>
<s> it is always a satisfaction to me to learn that i have given pleasure upon rational grounds and i have nothing to object to your poetical panegyric but the occasion which called it forth <\s>
<s> an admirer of my works zealous as you have declared yourself to be condescends too much when he gives way to an impulse proceeding from the or indeed from any other review <\s>
<s> the writers in these publications while they prosecute their inglorious employment cannot be supposed to be in a state of mind very favourable for being affected by the finer influences of a thing so pure as genuine poetry and as to the instance which has incited you to offer me this tribute of your gratitude though i have not seen it i doubt not but that it is a splenetic effusion of the conductor of that review who has taken a perpetual retainer from his own incapacity to plead against my claims to public approbation <\s>
<s> i differ from you in thinking that the only poetical lines in your address are stolen from myself <\s>

<s> it pleases though it does not surprise me to learn that having been affected early in life by my verses you have returned again to your old loves after some little infidelities which you were shamed into by commerce with the scribbling and chattering part of the world <\s>
<s> i have heard of many who upon their first acquaintance with my poetry have had much to get over before they could thoroughly relish it but never of one who having once learned to enjoy it had ceased to value it or survived his admiration <\s>

<s> of the thanksgiving ode and white doe of rylston letter to robert southey <\s>
<s> my dear southey i am much of your mind in respect to my ode <\s>
<s> had it been a hymn uttering the sentiments of a multitude a stanza would have been indispensable <\s>
<s> but though i have called it a thanksgiving ode strictly speaking it is not so but a poem composed or supposed to be composed on the morning of the thanksgiving uttering the sentiments of an individual upon that occasion <\s>
<s> it is a dramatised ejaculation and this if any thing can must excuse the irregular frame of the metre <\s>
<s> in respect to a stanza for a grand subject designed to be treated comprehensively there are great objections <\s>
<s> if the stanza be short it will scarcely allow of fervour and impetuosity unless so short as that the sense is run perpetually from one stanza to another as in horace's alcaics and if it be long it will be as apt to generate diffuseness as to check it <\s>
<s> of this we have innumerable instances in spenser and the italian poets <\s>
<s> the sense required cannot he included in one given stanza so that another whole stanza is added not unfrequently for the sake of matter which would naturally include itself in a very few lines <\s>
<s> if gray's plan be adopted there is not time to become acquainted with the arrangement and to recognise with pleasure the recurrence of the movement <\s>
<s> be so good as to let me know where you found most difficulty in following me <\s>
<s> the passage which i most suspect of being misunderstood is and thus is missed the sole true glory and the passage where i doubt most about the reasonableness of expecting that the reader should follow me in the luxuriance of the imagery and the language is the one that describes under so many metaphors the spreading of the news of the waterloo victory over the globe <\s>
<s> tell me if this displeased you <\s>
<s> do you know who reviewed the white doe in the quarterly <\s>
<s> after having asserted that mr <\s>
<s> uses his words without any regard to their sense the writer says that on no other principle can he explain that emily is always called the consecrated emily <\s>
<s> now the name emily occurs just fifteen times in the poem and out of these fifteen the epithet is attached to it once and that for the express purpose of recalling the scene in which she had been consecrated by her brother's solemn adjuration that she would fulfil her destiny and become a soul by force of sorrows high uplifted to the purest sky of undisturbed mortality <\s>
<s> the point upon which the whole moral interest of the piece hinges when that speech is closed occurs in this line he kissed the consecrated maid and to bring back this to the reader i repeated the epithet <\s>

<s> letter to robert southey <\s>
<s> dear southey my opinion in respect to epic poetry is much the same as the critic whom lucien buonaparte has quoted in his preface <\s>
<s> epic poetry of the highest class requires in the first place an action eminently influential an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man what the critics i believe call machinery and lastly i think with dennis that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry <\s>
<s> now tasso's is a religious subject and in my opinion a most happy one but i am confidently of opinion that the movement of tasso's poem rarely corresponds with the essential character of the subject nor do i think it possible that written in stanzas it should <\s>
<s> the celestial movement cannot i think be kept up if the sense is to be broken in that despotic manner at the close of every eight lines <\s>
<s> spenser's stanza is infinitely finer than the ottaca rhima but even spenser's will not allow the epic movement as exhibited by homer virgil and milton <\s>
<s> how noble is the first paragraph of the aeneid in point of sound compared with the first stanza of the jerusalem delivered <\s>

<s> in preparing his son for his university career he reperused the principal latin poets and doubtless the careful study of their works was not without a beneficial influence on his own <\s>

<s> dear southey my opinion in respect to epic poetry is much the same as the critic whom lucien buonaparte has quoted in his preface <\s>
<s> epic poetry of the highest class requires in the first place an action eminently influential an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man what the critics i believe call machinery and lastly i think with dennis that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry <\s>
<s> now tasso's is a religious subject and in my opinion a most happy one but i am confidently of opinion that the movement of tasso's poem rarely corresponds with the essential character of the subject nor do i think it possible that written in stanzas it should <\s>
<s> the celestial movement cannot i think be kept up if the sense is to be broken in that despotic manner at the close of every eight lines <\s>
<s> spenser's stanza is infinitely finer than the ottaca rhima but even spenser's will not allow the epic movement as exhibited by homer virgil and milton <\s>

<s> my dear southey i am much of your mind in respect to my ode <\s>
<s> had it been a hymn uttering the sentiments of a multitude a stanza would have been indispensable <\s>
<s> but though i have called it a thanksgiving ode strictly speaking it is not so but a poem composed or supposed to be composed on the morning of the thanksgiving uttering the sentiments of an individual upon that occasion <\s>
<s> it is a dramatised ejaculation and this if any thing can must excuse the irregular frame of the metre <\s>
<s> in respect to a stanza for a grand subject designed to be treated comprehensively there are great objections <\s>
<s> if the stanza be short it will scarcely allow of fervour and impetuosity unless so short as that the sense is run perpetually from one stanza to another as in horace's alcaics and if it be long it will be as apt to generate diffuseness as to check it <\s>
<s> of this we have innumerable instances in spenser and the italian poets <\s>
<s> the sense required cannot he included in one given stanza so that another whole stanza is added not unfrequently for the sake of matter which would naturally include itself in a very few lines <\s>
<s> if gray's plan be adopted there is not time to become acquainted with the arrangement and to recognise with pleasure the recurrence of the movement <\s>
<s> be so good as to let me know where you found most difficulty in following me <\s>
<s> the passage which i most suspect of being misunderstood is and thus is missed the sole true glory and the passage where i doubt most about the reasonableness of expecting that the reader should follow me in the luxuriance of the imagery and the language is the one that describes under so many metaphors the spreading of the news of the waterloo victory over the globe <\s>

<s> letter to robert southey <\s>
<s> dear southey my opinion in respect to epic poetry is much the same as the critic whom lucien buonaparte has quoted in his preface <\s>
<s> epic poetry of the highest class requires in the first place an action eminently influential an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man what the critics i believe call machinery and lastly i think with dennis that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry <\s>
<s> now tasso's is a religious subject and in my opinion a most happy one but i am confidently of opinion that the movement of tasso's poem rarely corresponds with the essential character of the subject nor do i think it possible that written in stanzas it should <\s>
<s> the celestial movement cannot i think be kept up if the sense is to be broken in that despotic manner at the close of every eight lines <\s>
<s> spenser's stanza is infinitely finer than the ottaca rhima but even spenser's will not allow the epic movement as exhibited by homer virgil and milton <\s>
<s> how noble is the first paragraph of the aeneid in point of sound compared with the first stanza of the jerusalem delivered <\s>
<s> the one winds with the majesty of the conscript fathers entering the senate house in solemn procession and the other has the pace of a set of recruits shuffling on the drill ground and receiving from the adjutant or drill serjeant the commands to halt at every ten or twenty steps <\s>

<s> about this time wordsworth's attention was given to the education of his eldest son this occupation appears to have been the occasion of their composition <\s>
<s> in preparing his son for his university career he reperused the principal latin poets and doubtless the careful study of their works was not without a beneficial influence on his own <\s>
<s> it imparted variety and richness to his conceptions and shed new graces on his style and rescued his poems from the charge of mannerism <\s>
<s> among the fruits of this course of reading was a translation of some of the earlier books of virgil's aeneid <\s>
<s> three books were finished <\s>
<s> this version was not executed in blank verse but in rhyme not however in the style of pope but with greater freedom and vigour <\s>
<s> a specimen of this translation was contributed by wordsworth to the philological museum printed at cambridge in 1832 [8 0 it was accompanied with the following letter from the author translation of part of the first book of the aeneid [8 1 to the editor off the philological museum <\s>
<s> your letter reminding me of an expectation i some time since held out to you of allowing some specimens of my translation from the aeneid to be printed in the philological museum was not very acceptable for i had abandoned the thought of ever sending into the world any part of that experiment for it was nothing more an experiment begun for amusement and i now think a less fortunate one than when i first named it to you <\s>

<s> had it been a hymn uttering the sentiments of a multitude a stanza would have been indispensable <\s>
<s> but though i have called it a thanksgiving ode strictly speaking it is not so but a poem composed or supposed to be composed on the morning of the thanksgiving uttering the sentiments of an individual upon that occasion <\s>
<s> it is a dramatised ejaculation and this if any thing can must excuse the irregular frame of the metre <\s>
<s> in respect to a stanza for a grand subject designed to be treated comprehensively there are great objections <\s>
<s> if the stanza be short it will scarcely allow of fervour and impetuosity unless so short as that the sense is run perpetually from one stanza to another as in horace's alcaics and if it be long it will be as apt to generate diffuseness as to check it <\s>
<s> of this we have innumerable instances in spenser and the italian poets <\s>
<s> the sense required cannot he included in one given stanza so that another whole stanza is added not unfrequently for the sake of matter which would naturally include itself in a very few lines <\s>
<s> if gray's plan be adopted there is not time to become acquainted with the arrangement and to recognise with pleasure the recurrence of the movement <\s>
<s> be so good as to let me know where you found most difficulty in following me <\s>
<s> the passage which i most suspect of being misunderstood is and thus is missed the sole true glory and the passage where i doubt most about the reasonableness of expecting that the reader should follow me in the luxuriance of the imagery and the language is the one that describes under so many metaphors the spreading of the news of the waterloo victory over the globe <\s>

<s> dear southey my opinion in respect to epic poetry is much the same as the critic whom lucien buonaparte has quoted in his preface <\s>
<s> epic poetry of the highest class requires in the first place an action eminently influential an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man what the critics i believe call machinery and lastly i think with dennis that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry <\s>
<s> now tasso's is a religious subject and in my opinion a most happy one but i am confidently of opinion that the movement of tasso's poem rarely corresponds with the essential character of the subject nor do i think it possible that written in stanzas it should <\s>
<s> the celestial movement cannot i think be kept up if the sense is to be broken in that despotic manner at the close of every eight lines <\s>
<s> spenser's stanza is infinitely finer than the ottaca rhima but even spenser's will not allow the epic movement as exhibited by homer virgil and milton <\s>

<s> pentameters where the sense has a close of some sort at every two lines may be rendered in regularly closed couplets but hexameters especially the virgilian that run the lines into each other for a great length cannot <\s>
<s> i have long been persuaded that milton formed his blank verse upon the model of the georgics and the aeneid and i am so much struck with this resemblance that i should have attempted virgil in blank verse had i not been persuaded that no ancient author can be with advantage so rendered <\s>
<s> their religion their warfare their course of action and feeling are too remote from modern interest to allow it <\s>
<s> we require every possible help and attraction of sound in our language to smooth the way for the admission of things so remote from our present concerns <\s>
<s> my own notion of translation is that it cannot be too literal provided three faults be avoided baldness in which i include all that takes from dignity and strangeness or uncouthness including harshness and lastly attempts to convey meanings which as they cannot be given but by languid circumlocutions cannot in fact be said to be given at all <\s>

<s> i was unable to get the meaning with tolerable harmony into fewer words which are more than to a modern reader perhaps it is worth <\s>
<s> i feel much at a loss without the assistance of the marks which i have requested to take an exact measure of your lordship's feelings with regard to the diction <\s>
<s> to save you the trouble of reference i will transcribe two passages from dryden first the celebrated appearance of hector's ghost to aeneas <\s>
<s> aeneas thus addresses him o light of trojans and support of troy thy father's champion and thy country s joy o long expected by thy friends from whence art thou returned so late for our defence <\s>
<s> do we behold thee wearied as we are with length of labours and with toils of war <\s>
<s> after so many funerals of thy own art thou restored to thy declining town <\s>
<s> this i think not an unfavourable specimen of dryden's way of treating the solemnly pathetic passages <\s>
<s> yet surely here is nothing of the cadence of the original and little of its spirit <\s>
<s> the second verse is not in the original and ought not to have been in dryden for it anticipates the beautiful hemistich sat patriae priamoque datum <\s>
<s> by the by there is the same sort of anticipation in a spirited and harmonious couplet preceding such as he was when by pelides slain thessalian coursers dragged him o'er the plain <\s>
<s> this introduction of pelides here is not in virgil because it would have prevented the effect of redit exuvias indutus achillei <\s>

<s> my dear southey i am much of your mind in respect to my ode <\s>

<s> but though i have called it a thanksgiving ode strictly speaking it is not so but a poem composed or supposed to be composed on the morning of the thanksgiving uttering the sentiments of an individual upon that occasion <\s>
<s> it is a dramatised ejaculation and this if any thing can must excuse the irregular frame of the metre <\s>
<s> in respect to a stanza for a grand subject designed to be treated comprehensively there are great objections <\s>
<s> if the stanza be short it will scarcely allow of fervour and impetuosity unless so short as that the sense is run perpetually from one stanza to another as in horace's alcaics and if it be long it will be as apt to generate diffuseness as to check it <\s>
<s> of this we have innumerable instances in spenser and the italian poets <\s>
<s> the sense required cannot he included in one given stanza so that another whole stanza is added not unfrequently for the sake of matter which would naturally include itself in a very few lines <\s>
<s> if gray's plan be adopted there is not time to become acquainted with the arrangement and to recognise with pleasure the recurrence of the movement <\s>
<s> be so good as to let me know where you found most difficulty in following me <\s>
<s> the passage which i most suspect of being misunderstood is and thus is missed the sole true glory and the passage where i doubt most about the reasonableness of expecting that the reader should follow me in the luxuriance of the imagery and the language is the one that describes under so many metaphors the spreading of the news of the waterloo victory over the globe <\s>

<s> letter to robert southey <\s>
<s> dear southey my opinion in respect to epic poetry is much the same as the critic whom lucien buonaparte has quoted in his preface <\s>
<s> epic poetry of the highest class requires in the first place an action eminently influential an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man what the critics i believe call machinery and lastly i think with dennis that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry <\s>
<s> now tasso's is a religious subject and in my opinion a most happy one but i am confidently of opinion that the movement of tasso's poem rarely corresponds with the essential character of the subject nor do i think it possible that written in stanzas it should <\s>
<s> the celestial movement cannot i think be kept up if the sense is to be broken in that despotic manner at the close of every eight lines <\s>
<s> spenser's stanza is infinitely finer than the ottaca rhima but even spenser's will not allow the epic movement as exhibited by homer virgil and milton <\s>
<s> how noble is the first paragraph of the aeneid in point of sound compared with the first stanza of the jerusalem delivered <\s>

<s> but though i have called it a thanksgiving ode strictly speaking it is not so but a poem composed or supposed to be composed on the morning of the thanksgiving uttering the sentiments of an individual upon that occasion <\s>
<s> it is a dramatised ejaculation and this if any thing can must excuse the irregular frame of the metre <\s>
<s> in respect to a stanza for a grand subject designed to be treated comprehensively there are great objections <\s>
<s> if the stanza be short it will scarcely allow of fervour and impetuosity unless so short as that the sense is run perpetually from one stanza to another as in horace's alcaics and if it be long it will be as apt to generate diffuseness as to check it <\s>
<s> of this we have innumerable instances in spenser and the italian poets <\s>
<s> the sense required cannot he included in one given stanza so that another whole stanza is added not unfrequently for the sake of matter which would naturally include itself in a very few lines <\s>
<s> if gray's plan be adopted there is not time to become acquainted with the arrangement and to recognise with pleasure the recurrence of the movement <\s>
<s> be so good as to let me know where you found most difficulty in following me <\s>

<s> dear southey my opinion in respect to epic poetry is much the same as the critic whom lucien buonaparte has quoted in his preface <\s>
<s> epic poetry of the highest class requires in the first place an action eminently influential an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man what the critics i believe call machinery and lastly i think with dennis that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry <\s>
<s> now tasso's is a religious subject and in my opinion a most happy one but i am confidently of opinion that the movement of tasso's poem rarely corresponds with the essential character of the subject nor do i think it possible that written in stanzas it should <\s>
<s> the celestial movement cannot i think be kept up if the sense is to be broken in that despotic manner at the close of every eight lines <\s>
<s> spenser's stanza is infinitely finer than the ottaca rhima but even spenser's will not allow the epic movement as exhibited by homer virgil and milton <\s>

<s> but though i have called it a thanksgiving ode strictly speaking it is not so but a poem composed or supposed to be composed on the morning of the thanksgiving uttering the sentiments of an individual upon that occasion <\s>
<s> it is a dramatised ejaculation and this if any thing can must excuse the irregular frame of the metre <\s>
<s> in respect to a stanza for a grand subject designed to be treated comprehensively there are great objections <\s>
<s> if the stanza be short it will scarcely allow of fervour and impetuosity unless so short as that the sense is run perpetually from one stanza to another as in horace's alcaics and if it be long it will be as apt to generate diffuseness as to check it <\s>
<s> of this we have innumerable instances in spenser and the italian poets <\s>
<s> the sense required cannot he included in one given stanza so that another whole stanza is added not unfrequently for the sake of matter which would naturally include itself in a very few lines <\s>

<s> dear southey my opinion in respect to epic poetry is much the same as the critic whom lucien buonaparte has quoted in his preface <\s>
<s> epic poetry of the highest class requires in the first place an action eminently influential an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man what the critics i believe call machinery and lastly i think with dennis that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry <\s>

<s> letter to robert southey <\s>
<s> dear southey my opinion in respect to epic poetry is much the same as the critic whom lucien buonaparte has quoted in his preface <\s>
<s> epic poetry of the highest class requires in the first place an action eminently influential an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man what the critics i believe call machinery and lastly i think with dennis that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry <\s>
<s> now tasso's is a religious subject and in my opinion a most happy one but i am confidently of opinion that the movement of tasso's poem rarely corresponds with the essential character of the subject nor do i think it possible that written in stanzas it should <\s>
<s> the celestial movement cannot i think be kept up if the sense is to be broken in that despotic manner at the close of every eight lines <\s>
<s> spenser's stanza is infinitely finer than the ottaca rhima but even spenser's will not allow the epic movement as exhibited by homer virgil and milton <\s>
<s> how noble is the first paragraph of the aeneid in point of sound compared with the first stanza of the jerusalem delivered <\s>

<s> in preparing his son for his university career he reperused the principal latin poets and doubtless the careful study of their works was not without a beneficial influence on his own <\s>

<s> your letter reminding me of an expectation i some time since held out to you of allowing some specimens of my translation from the aeneid to be printed in the philological museum was not very acceptable for i had abandoned the thought of ever sending into the world any part of that experiment for it was nothing more an experiment begun for amusement and i now think a less fortunate one than when i first named it to you <\s>

<s> epic poetry of the highest class requires in the first place an action eminently influential an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man what the critics i believe call machinery and lastly i think with dennis that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry <\s>
<s> now tasso's is a religious subject and in my opinion a most happy one but i am confidently of opinion that the movement of tasso's poem rarely corresponds with the essential character of the subject nor do i think it possible that written in stanzas it should <\s>
<s> the celestial movement cannot i think be kept up if the sense is to be broken in that despotic manner at the close of every eight lines <\s>
<s> spenser's stanza is infinitely finer than the ottaca rhima but even spenser's will not allow the epic movement as exhibited by homer virgil and milton <\s>
<s> how noble is the first paragraph of the aeneid in point of sound compared with the first stanza of the jerusalem delivered <\s>
<s> the one winds with the majesty of the conscript fathers entering the senate house in solemn procession and the other has the pace of a set of recruits shuffling on the drill ground and receiving from the adjutant or drill serjeant the commands to halt at every ten or twenty steps <\s>

<s> your letter reminding me of an expectation i some time since held out to you of allowing some specimens of my translation from the aeneid to be printed in the philological museum was not very acceptable for i had abandoned the thought of ever sending into the world any part of that experiment for it was nothing more an experiment begun for amusement and i now think a less fortunate one than when i first named it to you <\s>

<s> dear sir though my sister during my absence has returned thanks in my name for the verses which you have done me the honour of addressing to me and for the obliging letter which accompanies them i feel it incumbent on me on my return home to write a few words to the same purpose with my own hand <\s>
<s> it is always a satisfaction to me to learn that i have given pleasure upon rational grounds and i have nothing to object to your poetical panegyric but the occasion which called it forth <\s>
<s> an admirer of my works zealous as you have declared yourself to be condescends too much when he gives way to an impulse proceeding from the or indeed from any other review <\s>
<s> the writers in these publications while they prosecute their inglorious employment cannot be supposed to be in a state of mind very favourable for being affected by the finer influences of a thing so pure as genuine poetry and as to the instance which has incited you to offer me this tribute of your gratitude though i have not seen it i doubt not but that it is a splenetic effusion of the conductor of that review who has taken a perpetual retainer from his own incapacity to plead against my claims to public approbation <\s>
<s> i differ from you in thinking that the only poetical lines in your address are stolen from myself <\s>

<s> it pleases though it does not surprise me to learn that having been affected early in life by my verses you have returned again to your old loves after some little infidelities which you were shamed into by commerce with the scribbling and chattering part of the world <\s>
<s> i have heard of many who upon their first acquaintance with my poetry have had much to get over before they could thoroughly relish it but never of one who having once learned to enjoy it had ceased to value it or survived his admiration <\s>

<s> of the thanksgiving ode and white doe of rylston letter to robert southey <\s>
<s> my dear southey i am much of your mind in respect to my ode <\s>
<s> had it been a hymn uttering the sentiments of a multitude a stanza would have been indispensable <\s>
<s> but though i have called it a thanksgiving ode strictly speaking it is not so but a poem composed or supposed to be composed on the morning of the thanksgiving uttering the sentiments of an individual upon that occasion <\s>
<s> it is a dramatised ejaculation and this if any thing can must excuse the irregular frame of the metre <\s>
<s> in respect to a stanza for a grand subject designed to be treated comprehensively there are great objections <\s>
<s> if the stanza be short it will scarcely allow of fervour and impetuosity unless so short as that the sense is run perpetually from one stanza to another as in horace's alcaics and if it be long it will be as apt to generate diffuseness as to check it <\s>
<s> of this we have innumerable instances in spenser and the italian poets <\s>
<s> the sense required cannot he included in one given stanza so that another whole stanza is added not unfrequently for the sake of matter which would naturally include itself in a very few lines <\s>
<s> if gray's plan be adopted there is not time to become acquainted with the arrangement and to recognise with pleasure the recurrence of the movement <\s>
<s> be so good as to let me know where you found most difficulty in following me <\s>
<s> the passage which i most suspect of being misunderstood is and thus is missed the sole true glory and the passage where i doubt most about the reasonableness of expecting that the reader should follow me in the luxuriance of the imagery and the language is the one that describes under so many metaphors the spreading of the news of the waterloo victory over the globe <\s>
<s> tell me if this displeased you <\s>
<s> do you know who reviewed the white doe in the quarterly <\s>
<s> after having asserted that mr <\s>
<s> uses his words without any regard to their sense the writer says that on no other principle can he explain that emily is always called the consecrated emily <\s>
<s> now the name emily occurs just fifteen times in the poem and out of these fifteen the epithet is attached to it once and that for the express purpose of recalling the scene in which she had been consecrated by her brother's solemn adjuration that she would fulfil her destiny and become a soul by force of sorrows high uplifted to the purest sky of undisturbed mortality <\s>
<s> the point upon which the whole moral interest of the piece hinges when that speech is closed occurs in this line he kissed the consecrated maid and to bring back this to the reader i repeated the epithet <\s>

<s> letter to robert southey <\s>
<s> dear southey my opinion in respect to epic poetry is much the same as the critic whom lucien buonaparte has quoted in his preface <\s>
<s> epic poetry of the highest class requires in the first place an action eminently influential an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man what the critics i believe call machinery and lastly i think with dennis that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry <\s>
<s> now tasso's is a religious subject and in my opinion a most happy one but i am confidently of opinion that the movement of tasso's poem rarely corresponds with the essential character of the subject nor do i think it possible that written in stanzas it should <\s>
<s> the celestial movement cannot i think be kept up if the sense is to be broken in that despotic manner at the close of every eight lines <\s>
<s> spenser's stanza is infinitely finer than the ottaca rhima but even spenser's will not allow the epic movement as exhibited by homer virgil and milton <\s>
<s> how noble is the first paragraph of the aeneid in point of sound compared with the first stanza of the jerusalem delivered <\s>

<s> in preparing his son for his university career he reperused the principal latin poets and doubtless the careful study of their works was not without a beneficial influence on his own <\s>

<s> dear southey my opinion in respect to epic poetry is much the same as the critic whom lucien buonaparte has quoted in his preface <\s>
<s> epic poetry of the highest class requires in the first place an action eminently influential an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man what the critics i believe call machinery and lastly i think with dennis that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry <\s>
<s> now tasso's is a religious subject and in my opinion a most happy one but i am confidently of opinion that the movement of tasso's poem rarely corresponds with the essential character of the subject nor do i think it possible that written in stanzas it should <\s>
<s> the celestial movement cannot i think be kept up if the sense is to be broken in that despotic manner at the close of every eight lines <\s>
<s> spenser's stanza is infinitely finer than the ottaca rhima but even spenser's will not allow the epic movement as exhibited by homer virgil and milton <\s>

<s> my dear southey i am much of your mind in respect to my ode <\s>
<s> had it been a hymn uttering the sentiments of a multitude a stanza would have been indispensable <\s>
<s> but though i have called it a thanksgiving ode strictly speaking it is not so but a poem composed or supposed to be composed on the morning of the thanksgiving uttering the sentiments of an individual upon that occasion <\s>
<s> it is a dramatised ejaculation and this if any thing can must excuse the irregular frame of the metre <\s>
<s> in respect to a stanza for a grand subject designed to be treated comprehensively there are great objections <\s>
<s> if the stanza be short it will scarcely allow of fervour and impetuosity unless so short as that the sense is run perpetually from one stanza to another as in horace's alcaics and if it be long it will be as apt to generate diffuseness as to check it <\s>
<s> of this we have innumerable instances in spenser and the italian poets <\s>
<s> the sense required cannot he included in one given stanza so that another whole stanza is added not unfrequently for the sake of matter which would naturally include itself in a very few lines <\s>
<s> if gray's plan be adopted there is not time to become acquainted with the arrangement and to recognise with pleasure the recurrence of the movement <\s>
<s> be so good as to let me know where you found most difficulty in following me <\s>
<s> the passage which i most suspect of being misunderstood is and thus is missed the sole true glory and the passage where i doubt most about the reasonableness of expecting that the reader should follow me in the luxuriance of the imagery and the language is the one that describes under so many metaphors the spreading of the news of the waterloo victory over the globe <\s>

<s> letter to robert southey <\s>
<s> dear southey my opinion in respect to epic poetry is much the same as the critic whom lucien buonaparte has quoted in his preface <\s>
<s> epic poetry of the highest class requires in the first place an action eminently influential an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man what the critics i believe call machinery and lastly i think with dennis that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry <\s>
<s> now tasso's is a religious subject and in my opinion a most happy one but i am confidently of opinion that the movement of tasso's poem rarely corresponds with the essential character of the subject nor do i think it possible that written in stanzas it should <\s>
<s> the celestial movement cannot i think be kept up if the sense is to be broken in that despotic manner at the close of every eight lines <\s>
<s> spenser's stanza is infinitely finer than the ottaca rhima but even spenser's will not allow the epic movement as exhibited by homer virgil and milton <\s>
<s> how noble is the first paragraph of the aeneid in point of sound compared with the first stanza of the jerusalem delivered <\s>
<s> the one winds with the majesty of the conscript fathers entering the senate house in solemn procession and the other has the pace of a set of recruits shuffling on the drill ground and receiving from the adjutant or drill serjeant the commands to halt at every ten or twenty steps <\s>

<s> about this time wordsworth's attention was given to the education of his eldest son this occupation appears to have been the occasion of their composition <\s>
<s> in preparing his son for his university career he reperused the principal latin poets and doubtless the careful study of their works was not without a beneficial influence on his own <\s>
<s> it imparted variety and richness to his conceptions and shed new graces on his style and rescued his poems from the charge of mannerism <\s>
<s> among the fruits of this course of reading was a translation of some of the earlier books of virgil's aeneid <\s>
<s> three books were finished <\s>
<s> this version was not executed in blank verse but in rhyme not however in the style of pope but with greater freedom and vigour <\s>
<s> a specimen of this translation was contributed by wordsworth to the philological museum printed at cambridge in 1832 [8 0 it was accompanied with the following letter from the author translation of part of the first book of the aeneid [8 1 to the editor off the philological museum <\s>
<s> your letter reminding me of an expectation i some time since held out to you of allowing some specimens of my translation from the aeneid to be printed in the philological museum was not very acceptable for i had abandoned the thought of ever sending into the world any part of that experiment for it was nothing more an experiment begun for amusement and i now think a less fortunate one than when i first named it to you <\s>

<s> had it been a hymn uttering the sentiments of a multitude a stanza would have been indispensable <\s>
<s> but though i have called it a thanksgiving ode strictly speaking it is not so but a poem composed or supposed to be composed on the morning of the thanksgiving uttering the sentiments of an individual upon that occasion <\s>
<s> it is a dramatised ejaculation and this if any thing can must excuse the irregular frame of the metre <\s>
<s> in respect to a stanza for a grand subject designed to be treated comprehensively there are great objections <\s>
<s> if the stanza be short it will scarcely allow of fervour and impetuosity unless so short as that the sense is run perpetually from one stanza to another as in horace's alcaics and if it be long it will be as apt to generate diffuseness as to check it <\s>
<s> of this we have innumerable instances in spenser and the italian poets <\s>
<s> the sense required cannot he included in one given stanza so that another whole stanza is added not unfrequently for the sake of matter which would naturally include itself in a very few lines <\s>
<s> if gray's plan be adopted there is not time to become acquainted with the arrangement and to recognise with pleasure the recurrence of the movement <\s>
<s> be so good as to let me know where you found most difficulty in following me <\s>
<s> the passage which i most suspect of being misunderstood is and thus is missed the sole true glory and the passage where i doubt most about the reasonableness of expecting that the reader should follow me in the luxuriance of the imagery and the language is the one that describes under so many metaphors the spreading of the news of the waterloo victory over the globe <\s>

<s> dear southey my opinion in respect to epic poetry is much the same as the critic whom lucien buonaparte has quoted in his preface <\s>
<s> epic poetry of the highest class requires in the first place an action eminently influential an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man what the critics i believe call machinery and lastly i think with dennis that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry <\s>
<s> now tasso's is a religious subject and in my opinion a most happy one but i am confidently of opinion that the movement of tasso's poem rarely corresponds with the essential character of the subject nor do i think it possible that written in stanzas it should <\s>
<s> the celestial movement cannot i think be kept up if the sense is to be broken in that despotic manner at the close of every eight lines <\s>
<s> spenser's stanza is infinitely finer than the ottaca rhima but even spenser's will not allow the epic movement as exhibited by homer virgil and milton <\s>

<s> pentameters where the sense has a close of some sort at every two lines may be rendered in regularly closed couplets but hexameters especially the virgilian that run the lines into each other for a great length cannot <\s>
<s> i have long been persuaded that milton formed his blank verse upon the model of the georgics and the aeneid and i am so much struck with this resemblance that i should have attempted virgil in blank verse had i not been persuaded that no ancient author can be with advantage so rendered <\s>
<s> their religion their warfare their course of action and feeling are too remote from modern interest to allow it <\s>
<s> we require every possible help and attraction of sound in our language to smooth the way for the admission of things so remote from our present concerns <\s>
<s> my own notion of translation is that it cannot be too literal provided three faults be avoided baldness in which i include all that takes from dignity and strangeness or uncouthness including harshness and lastly attempts to convey meanings which as they cannot be given but by languid circumlocutions cannot in fact be said to be given at all <\s>

<s> i was unable to get the meaning with tolerable harmony into fewer words which are more than to a modern reader perhaps it is worth <\s>
<s> i feel much at a loss without the assistance of the marks which i have requested to take an exact measure of your lordship's feelings with regard to the diction <\s>
<s> to save you the trouble of reference i will transcribe two passages from dryden first the celebrated appearance of hector's ghost to aeneas <\s>
<s> aeneas thus addresses him o light of trojans and support of troy thy father's champion and thy country s joy o long expected by thy friends from whence art thou returned so late for our defence <\s>
<s> do we behold thee wearied as we are with length of labours and with toils of war <\s>
<s> after so many funerals of thy own art thou restored to thy declining town <\s>
<s> this i think not an unfavourable specimen of dryden's way of treating the solemnly pathetic passages <\s>
<s> yet surely here is nothing of the cadence of the original and little of its spirit <\s>
<s> the second verse is not in the original and ought not to have been in dryden for it anticipates the beautiful hemistich sat patriae priamoque datum <\s>
<s> by the by there is the same sort of anticipation in a spirited and harmonious couplet preceding such as he was when by pelides slain thessalian coursers dragged him o'er the plain <\s>
<s> this introduction of pelides here is not in virgil because it would have prevented the effect of redit exuvias indutus achillei <\s>

<s> i shall be much gratified if you happen to like my translation and thankful for any remarks with which you may honour me <\s>
<s> i have made so much progress with the second book that i defer sending the former till that is finished <\s>
<s> it takes in many places a high tone of passion which i would gladly succeed in rendering <\s>
<s> when i read virgil in the original i am moved but not so much so by the translation and i cannot but think this owing to a defect in the diction which i have endeavoured to supply with what success you will easily be enabled to judge <\s>
<s> ever my lord most faithfully your obliged friend and servant wm <\s>
<s> wordsworth [8 3 feb <\s>
<s> my lord i am truly obliged by your friendly and frank communication <\s>
<s> may i beg that you would add to the favour by marking with a pencil some of the passages that are faulty in your view of the case <\s>
<s> we seem pretty much of opinion upon the subject of rhyme <\s>
<s> pentameters where the sense has a close of some sort at every two lines may be rendered in regularly closed couplets but hexameters especially the virgilian that run the lines into each other for a great length cannot <\s>
<s> i have long been persuaded that milton formed his blank verse upon the model of the georgics and the aeneid and i am so much struck with this resemblance that i should have attempted virgil in blank verse had i not been persuaded that no ancient author can be with advantage so rendered <\s>
<s> their religion their warfare their course of action and feeling are too remote from modern interest to allow it <\s>
<s> we require every possible help and attraction of sound in our language to smooth the way for the admission of things so remote from our present concerns <\s>
<s> my own notion of translation is that it cannot be too literal provided three faults be avoided baldness in which i include all that takes from dignity and strangeness or uncouthness including harshness and lastly attempts to convey meanings which as they cannot be given but by languid circumlocutions cannot in fact be said to be given at all <\s>
<s> i will trouble you with an instance in which i fear this fault exists <\s>
<s> virgil describing aeneas's voyage third book verse 551 says hinc sinus herculei si vera est fama <\s>
<s> [8 3 memoirs ii <\s>
<s> i render it thus hence we behold the bay that bears the name of proud tarentum proud to share the fame of hercules though by a dubious claim <\s>
<s> i was unable to get the meaning with tolerable harmony into fewer words which are more than to a modern reader perhaps it is worth <\s>
<s> i feel much at a loss without the assistance of the marks which i have requested to take an exact measure of your lordship's feelings with regard to the diction <\s>
<s> to save you the trouble of reference i will transcribe two passages from dryden first the celebrated appearance of hector's ghost to aeneas <\s>
<s> aeneas thus addresses him o light of trojans and support of troy thy father's champion and thy country s joy o long expected by thy friends from whence art thou returned so late for our defence <\s>
<s> do we behold thee wearied as we are with length of labours and with toils of war <\s>
<s> after so many funerals of thy own art thou restored to thy declining town <\s>
<s> this i think not an unfavourable specimen of dryden's way of treating the solemnly pathetic passages <\s>
<s> yet surely here is nothing of the cadence of the original and little of its spirit <\s>
<s> the second verse is not in the original and ought not to have been in dryden for it anticipates the beautiful hemistich sat patriae priamoque datum <\s>
<s> by the by there is the same sort of anticipation in a spirited and harmonious couplet preceding such as he was when by pelides slain thessalian coursers dragged him o'er the plain <\s>
<s> this introduction of pelides here is not in virgil because it would have prevented the effect of redit exuvias indutus achillei <\s>
<s> there is a striking solemnity in the answer of pantheus to aeneas venit summa dies et ineluctabile tempus dardaniae fuimus troës fuit ilium et ingens gloria teucrorum c <\s>
<s> dryden thus gives it then pantheus with a groan troy is no more and ilium was a town <\s>
<s> the fatal day the appointed hour is come when wrathful jove's irrevocable doom transfers the trojan state to grecian hands <\s>
<s> the fire consumes the town the foe commands <\s>
<s> my own translation runs thus and i quote it because it occurred to my mind immediately on reading your lordship's observations tis come the final hour th inevitable close of dardan power hath come <\s>

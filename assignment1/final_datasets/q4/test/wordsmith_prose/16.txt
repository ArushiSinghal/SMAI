<s> the character of dyer as a patriot a citizen and a tender hearted friend of humanity was in some respects injurious to him as a poet and has induced him to dwell in his poem upon processes which however important in themselves were unsusceptible of being poetically treated <\s>

<s> a little before sunset we came in sight of llanberris lake snowdon and all the craggy hills and mountains surrounding it the foreground a beautiful contrast to this grandeur and desolation a green sloping hollow furnishing a shelter for one of the most beautiful collections of lowly welsh cottages with thatched roofs overgrown with plants anywhere to be met with the hamlet is called cum y glo <\s>

<s> there being no carriage road we undertook to walk by the pass of llanberris eight miles to capel cerig this proved fatiguing but it was the only oppressive exertion we made during the course of our tour <\s>
<s> we arrived at capel cerig in time for a glance at the snowdonian range from the garden of the inn in connection with the lake or rather pool reflecting the crimson clouds of evening <\s>
<s> the outline of snowdon is perhaps seen nowhere to more advantage than from this place <\s>
<s> next morning five miles down a beautiful valley to the banks of the conway which stream we followed to llanrwst but the day was so hot that we could only make use of the morning and evening <\s>
<s> the best way perhaps of managing this republication would be to print it in a very elegant type and paper and not many copies to be sold high so that it might be prized by the collectors as a curiosity <\s>
<s> bearing in mind how many excellent things there are in sir john beaumont's little volume i am somewhat mortified at this mode of honouring his memory but in the present state of the taste of this country i cannot flatter myself that poems of that character would win their way into general circulation <\s>

<s> letter to sir george h <\s>
<s> my dear sir george i have to thank you for two letters <\s>
<s> lady beaumont also will accept my acknowledgments for the interesting letter with which she favoured me <\s>
<s> i learn from mrs <\s>
<s> coleridge who has lately heard from c that alston the painter has arrived in london <\s>
<s> coleridge speaks of him as a most interesting person <\s>
<s> he has brought with him a few pictures from his own pencil among others a cupid and psyche which in c s opinion has not for colouring been surpassed since titian <\s>
<s> is about to deliver a course of lectures upon poetry at some institution in the city <\s>
<s> he is well and i learn that the friend has been a good deal inquired after lately <\s>
<s> for ourselves we never hear from him <\s>
<s> i am glad that the inscriptions please you <\s>
<s> it did always appear to me that inscriptions particularly those in verse or in a dead language were never supposed necessarily to be the composition of those in whose name they appeared <\s>
<s> if a more striking or more dramatic effect could be produced i have always thought that in an epitaph or memorial of any kind a father or husband c <\s>
<s> might be introduced speaking without any absolute deception being intended that is the reader is understood to be at liberty to say to himself these verses or this latin may be the composition of some unknown person and not that of the father widow or friend from whose hand or voice they profess to proceed <\s>
<s> if the composition be natural affecting or beautiful it is all that is required <\s>
<s> this at least was my view of the subject or i should not have adopted that mode <\s>
<s> however in respect to your scruples which i feel are both delicate and reasonable i have altered the verses and i have only to regret that the alteration is not more happily done <\s>
<s> but i never found anything more difficult <\s>
<s> i wished to preserve the expression patrimonial grounds but i found this impossible on account of the awkwardness of the pronouns he and his as applied to reynolds and to yourself <\s>
<s> this even where it does not produce confusion is always inelegant <\s>
<s> i was therefore obliged to drop it so that we must be content i fear with the inscription as it stands below <\s>
<s> as you mention that the first copy was mislaid i will transcribe the first part from that but you can either choose the dome or the abbey as you like <\s>
<s> ye lime trees ranged before this hallowed urn shoot forth with lively power at spring's return and be not slow a stately growth to rear of pillars branching off from year to year till ye have framed at length a darksome aisle like a recess within that sacred pile where reynolds mid our country's noblest dead in the last sanctity of fame is laid c <\s>
<s> i hope this will do: i tried a hundred different ways but cannot hit upon anything better <\s>
<s> i am sorry to learn from lady beaumont that there is reason to believe that our cedar is already perished <\s>
<s> i am sorry for it <\s>
<s> the verses upon that subject you and lady b <\s>
<s> praise highly and certainly if they have merit as i cannot but think they have your discriminating praises have pointed it out <\s>
<s> the alteration in the beginning i think with you is a great improvement and the first line is to my ear very rich and grateful <\s>
<s> as to the female and male i know not how to get rid of it for that circumstance gives the recess an appropriate interest <\s>
<s> bowles the poet objected to the word ravishment at the end of the sonnet to the winter garden yet it has the authority of all the first rate poets for instance milton in whose sight all things joy with ravishment attracted by thy beauty still to gaze <\s>
<s> objections upon these grounds merit more attention in regard to inscriptions than any other sort of composition and on this account the lines i mean those upon the niche had better be suppressed for it is not improbable that the altering of them might cost me more trouble than writing a hundred fresh ones <\s>
<s> we were happy to hear that your mother lady beaumont was so surprisingly well <\s>
<s> you do not mention the school at coleorton <\s>
<s> pray how is wilkie in health and also as to progress in his art <\s>
<s> i do not doubt that i shall like arnold's picture but he would have been a better painter if his genius had led him to read more in the early part of his life <\s>
<s> wilkie's style of painting does not require that the mind should be fed from books but i do not think it possible to excel in landscape painting without a strong tincture of the poetic spirit 37 of the inscriptions at coleorton <\s>
<s> letter to lady beaumont <\s>
<s> my dear lady beaumont when you see this you will think i mean to overrun you with inscriptions i do not mean to tax you with putting them up only with reading them <\s>
<s> the following i composed yesterday morning in a walk from brathway whither i had been to accompany my sister <\s>
<s> for a seat in the groves of coleorton <\s>
<s> beneath yon eastern ridge the craggy bound rugged and high of charnwood's forest ground stand yet but stranger <\s>
<s> hidden from thy view the ivied ruins of forlorn grace dieu c <\s>
<s> i hope that neither you nor sir george will think that the above takes from the effect of the mention of francis beaumont in the poem upon the cedar <\s>
<s> grace dieu is itself so interesting a spot and has naturally and historically such a connection with coleorton that i could not deny myself the pleasure of paying it this mark of attention <\s>
<s> the thought of writing the inscription occurred to me many years ago <\s>
<s> i took the liberty of transcribing for sir george an alteration which i had made in the inscription for st <\s>
<s> herbert's island i was not then quite satisfied with it i have since retouched it and will trouble you to read him the following which i hope will give you pleasure <\s>
<s> this island guarded from profane approach by mountains high and waters widely spread gave to st <\s>
<s> herbert a benign retreat c <\s>
<s> i ought to mention that the line and things of holy use unhallowed lie is taken from the following of daniel strait all that holy was unhallowed lies <\s>
<s> i will take this occasion of recommending to you if you happen to have daniel's poems to read the epistle addressed to the lady margaret countess of cumberland beginning he that of such a height hath built his mind <\s>
<s> the whole poem is composed in a strain of meditative morality more dignified and affecting than anything of the kind i ever read <\s>
<s> it is besides strikingly applicable to the revolutions of the present times <\s>
<s> my dear lady beaumont your letter and the accounts it contains of the winter garden gave me great pleasure <\s>
<s> i cannot but think that under your care it will grow up into one of the most beautiful and interesting spots in england <\s>
<s> we all here have a longing desire to see it <\s>
<s> i have mentioned the high opinion we have of it to a couple of my friends persons of taste living in this country who are determined the first time they are called up to london to turn aside to visit it which i said they might without scruple do if they mentioned my name to the gardener <\s>
<s> my sister begs me to say that she is aware how long she has been in your debt and that she should have written before now but that as i have latterly been in frequent communication with coleorton she thought it as well to defer answering your letter <\s>
<s> do you see the courier newspaper at dunmow <\s>
<s> i ask on account of a little poem upon the comet which i have read in it to day <\s>
<s> though with several defects and some feeble and constrained expressions it has great merit and is far superior to the run not merely of newspaper but of modern poetry in general <\s>
<s> i half suspect it to be coleridge's for though it is in parts inferior to him i know no other writer of the day who can do so well <\s>
<s> it consists of five stanzas in the measure of the fairy queen <\s>
<s> it is to be found in last saturday's paper november 16th <\s>

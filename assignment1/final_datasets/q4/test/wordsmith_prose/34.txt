<s> grasmere march 27 1811 <\s>
<s> my dear wrangham your last letter which i have left so long unanswered found me in a distressed state of mind with one of my children lying nearly as i thought at the point of death <\s>
<s> this put me off answering your letter .... <\s>
<s> you return to the r <\s>
<s> i am decidedly of opinion that no further concessions should be made <\s>
<s> catholic emancipation is a mere pretext of ambitious and discontented men <\s>
<s> are you prepared for the next step a r <\s>
<s> i confess i dread the thought <\s>
<s> as to the bible society my view of the subject is as follows 1st <\s>
<s> distributing bibles is a good thing <\s>
<s> more bibles will be distributed in consequence of the existence of the bible society therefore so far as that goes the existence of the bible society is good <\s>
<s> i have ordered it to be sent to two the spanish and portuguese ambassadors and three or four other public men and members of parliament but to nobody of my friends and relations <\s>
<s> it is printed with my name and i believe will be published by longman .... <\s>
<s> i am very happy that you have not been inattentive to my suggestion on the subject of topography <\s>
<s> when i ventured to recommend the pursuit to you i did not for a moment suppose that it was to interfere with your appropriate duties as a parish priest far otherwise but i know you are of an active mind and i am sure that a portion of your time might be thus employed without any deduction from that which was due to your professional engagements <\s>
<s> it would be a recreation to you and also it does appear to me that records of this kind ought to be executed by somebody or other both for the instruction of those now living and for the sake of posterity and if so the duty devolves more naturally upon clergymen than upon other persons as their opportunities and qualifications are both likely to be better than those of other men <\s>
<s> if you have not seen white's and whitaker's books do procure a sight of them <\s>
<s> i was aware that you would think me fair game upon the roman catholic question but really i should be greatly obliged to any man who would help me over the difficulty i stated <\s>
<s> if the roman catholics upon the plea of their being the majority merely which implies an admission on our part that their profession of faith is in itself as good as ours as consistent with civil liberty if they are to have their requests accorded how can they be refused consistently the further prayer of being constituted upon the same plea the established church <\s>
<s> i confess i am not prepared for this <\s>
<s> with the methodists on one side and the catholics on the other what is to become of the poor church and the people of england <\s>
<s> to both of which i am most tenderly attached and to the former not the less so on account of the pretty little spire of broughton parish church under which you and i were made happy men by the gift from providence of two excellent wives <\s>
<s> wrangham present my cordial regards and believe me dear wrangham your very sincere and affectionate friend w <\s>
<s> the tractate on the convention of cintra letter to lord lonsdale <\s>
<s> grasmere may 25 1809 <\s>
<s> my lord i had also another reason for deferring this acknowledgment to your lordship viz <\s>
<s> that at the same time i wished to present to you a tract which i have lately written and which i hope you have now received <\s>
<s> it was finished and ought to have appeared two months ago but has been delayed by circumstances connected with my distance from the press over which i had no control <\s>
<s> if this tract should so far interest your lordship as to induce you to peruse it i do not doubt that it will be thoughtfully and candidly judged by you in which case i fear no censure but that which every man is liable to who with good intentions may have occasionally fallen into error while at the same time i have an entire confidence that the principles which i have endeavoured to uphold must have the sanction of a mind distinguished like that of your lordship for regard to morality and religion and the true dignity and honour of your country <\s>
<s> may i beg of your lordship to present my respectful compliments to lady lonsdale <\s>

<s> of the convention of cintra c letter to southey <\s>
<s> my dear southey 62 62 mr <\s>
<s> southey's opinions on the convention of cintra at the time of its ratification were in unison with those of his friend <\s>
<s> see southey's correspondence vol <\s>
<s> campbell our neighbour at g has sent for your book he served during the whole of the peninsular war and you shall hear what he says of it in due course <\s>
<s> we are out of the way of all literary communication so i can report nothing <\s>
<s> i have read the whole with great pleasure the work will do you everlasting honour <\s>
<s> i have said the whole forgetting in that contemplation my feelings upon one part where you have tickled with a feather when you should have branded with a red hot iron <\s>
<s> you will guess i mean the convention of cintra <\s>
<s> my detestation i may say abhorrence of that event is not at all diminished by your account of it <\s>
<s> buonaparte had committed a capital blunder in supposing that when he had intimidated the sovereigns of europe he had conquered the several nations <\s>
<s> yet it was natural for a wiser than he was to have fallen into this mistake for the old despotisms had deprived the body of the people of all practical knowledge in the management and of necessity of all interest in the course of affairs <\s>
<s> the french themselves were astonished at the apathy and ignorance of the people whom they had supposed they had utterly subdued when they had taken their fortresses scattered their armies entered their capital cities and struck their cabinets with dismay <\s>
<s> there was no hope for the deliverance of europe till the nations had suffered enough to be driven to a passionate recollection of all that was honourable in their past history and to make appeal to the principles of universal and everlasting justice <\s>
<s> these sentiments the authors of that convention most unfeelingly violated and as to the principles they seemed to be as little aware even of the existence of such powers for powers emphatically may they be called as the tyrant himself <\s>
<s> as far therefore as these men could they put an extinguisher upon the star which was then rising <\s>
<s> it is in vain to say that after the first burst of indignation was over the portuguese themselves were reconciled to the event and rejoiced in their deliverance <\s>
<s> we may infer from that the horror which they must have felt in the presence of their oppressors and we may see in it to what a state of helplessness their bad government had reduced them <\s>
<s> our duty was to have treated them with respect as the representatives of suffering humanity beyond what they were likely to look for themselves and as deserving greatly in common with their spanish brethren for having been the first to rise against the tremendous oppression and to show how and how only it could be put an end to <\s>
<s> home at grasmere the parsonage the house which i have for some time occupied is the parsonage of grasmere <\s>
<s> it stands close by the churchyard where his two children were buried and i have found it absolutely necessary that we should quit a place which by recalling to our minds at every moment the losses we have sustained in the course of the last year 1811 12 would grievously retard our progress toward that tranquillity which it is our duty to aim at 64 38 <\s>

<s> hamilton i profit by the frank in which the letter for your sister will be enclosed to thank you for yours of the 11th and the accompanying spirited and elegant verses <\s>
<s> you ask many questions kindly testifying thereby the interest you take in us and our neighbourhood <\s>
<s> most probably some of them are answered in my daughter's letter to miss e h <\s>
<s> i will however myself reply to one or two at the risk of repeating what she may have said <\s>
<s> hemans has not sent us any tidings of her movements and intentions since she left us so i am unable to tell you whether she mean to settle in edinburgh or london <\s>

<s> that accommodation is i suppose more rare in scotland than at this season in our neighbourhood <\s>
<s> i assure you the weather has been so unfavourable to out door amusements since you left us not but that we have had a sprinkling of fine and bright days that little or no progress has been made in the game of the graces and i fear that amusement must be deferred till next summer if we or anybody else are to see another <\s>

<s> cooper a clergyman who has just come to the living of hawkshend about five miles from ambleside <\s>
<s> did i tell you that professor wilson with his two sons and daughter have been and probably still are at elleray <\s>
<s> he heads the gaieties of the neighbourhood and has presided as steward at two regattas <\s>
<s> do these employments come under your notions of action opposed to contemplation <\s>
<s> why should they not <\s>
<s> whatever the high moralists may say the political economists will i conclude approve them as setting capital afloat and giving an impulse to manufacture and handicrafts but i speak of the improvement which may come thence to navigation and nautical science <\s>
<s> i have dined twice along with my brother who left us some time ago in the professor's company at mrs <\s>
<s> watson's widow of the bp at calgarth and at mr <\s>

<s> there is another acquaintance of mine also recently gone a person for whom i never had any love but with whom i had for a short time a good deal of intimacy <\s>
<s> i mean hazlitt whose death you may have seen announced in the papers <\s>
<s> he was a man of extraordinary acuteness but perverse as lord byron himself whose life by galt i have been skimming since i came here <\s>
<s> galt affects to be very profound though he is in fact a very shallow fellow and perhaps the most illogical writer that these illogical days have produced <\s>
<s> his buts and his therefores are singularly misapplied singularly even for this unthinking age <\s>
<s> southey of pursuing lord b with rancour <\s>
<s> i should like a reference to what mr <\s>
<s> s has written of lord b to ascertain whether this charge be well founded <\s>
<s> i trust it is not both from what i know of my friend and for the aversion which mr <\s>
<s> g has expressed towards the lakers whom in the plenitude of his ignorance he is pleased to speak of as a class or school of poets <\s>
<s> now for a word on the serious part of your letter <\s>

<s> if you can lay your hands upon mr <\s>
<s> coleridge's friend you will find some remarks of mine upon a letter signed if i recollect right mathetes which was written by professor wilson in which if i am not mistaken sentiments like yours are expressed <\s>
<s> at all events i am sure that i have long retained those opinions and have frequently expressed them either by letter or otherwise <\s>
<s> one thing however is not to be forgotten concerning active life that a personal independence must be provided for and in some cases more is required ability to assist our friends relations and natural dependents <\s>

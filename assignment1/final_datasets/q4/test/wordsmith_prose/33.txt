<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>

<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>

<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>

<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>
<s> this dryden has spoiled <\s>
<s> he says first very well the faults of love by love are justified and then come four lines of miserable rant quite ?la maximin <\s>

<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>

<s> letter to sir walter scott 55 55 from lockhart's life of scott vol <\s>
<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>
<s> this dryden has spoiled <\s>
<s> he says first very well the faults of love by love are justified and then come four lines of miserable rant quite ?la maximin <\s>

<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>

<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>

<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>
<s> this dryden has spoiled <\s>
<s> he says first very well the faults of love by love are justified and then come four lines of miserable rant quite ?la maximin <\s>

<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>

<s> letter to sir walter scott 55 55 from lockhart's life of scott vol <\s>
<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>
<s> this dryden has spoiled <\s>
<s> he says first very well the faults of love by love are justified and then come four lines of miserable rant quite ?la maximin <\s>

<s> letter to sir walter scott 55 55 from lockhart's life of scott vol <\s>
<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>
<s> this dryden has spoiled <\s>
<s> he says first very well the faults of love by love are justified and then come four lines of miserable rant quite ?la maximin <\s>

<s> extract of letter to sir walter scott 1808 <\s>

<s> i think your end has been attained <\s>
<s> that it is not the end which i should wish you to propose to yourself you will be well aware from what you know of my notions of composition both as to matter and manner <\s>
<s> in the circle of my acquaintance it seems as well liked as the lay though i have heard that in the world it is not so <\s>
<s> had the poem been much better than the lay it could scarcely have satisfied the public which has too much of the monster the moral monster in its composition <\s>

<s> they have told us over and over again that they are fighting against a foreign tyrant who has dealt with them most perfidiously and inhumanly who must hate them for their worth and on account of the injuries they have received from him and whom they must hate accordingly against a ruler over whom they could have no control and for one whom they have told us they will establish as a sovereign of a free people and therefore must he himself be a limited monarch <\s>

<s> you will wonder to hear me talk of principles when i have told you that i also do not go along with you in your sentiments respecting the roman catholic question <\s>

<s> there is yet another circumstance in which i differ from you <\s>
<s> bell's plan of education be of that importance which it appears to be of it cannot be a matter of indifference whether he or lancaster have a rightful claim to the invention <\s>
<s> for heaven's sake let all benefactors of their species have the honour due to them <\s>

<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>
<s> this dryden has spoiled <\s>
<s> he says first very well the faults of love by love are justified and then come four lines of miserable rant quite ?la maximin <\s>

<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>

<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>

<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>
<s> this dryden has spoiled <\s>
<s> he says first very well the faults of love by love are justified and then come four lines of miserable rant quite ?la maximin <\s>

<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>
<s> this dryden has spoiled <\s>
<s> he says first very well the faults of love by love are justified and then come four lines of miserable rant quite ?la maximin <\s>
<s> farewell and believe me ever your affectionate friend william wordsworth <\s>
<s> extract of letter to sir walter scott 1808 <\s>
<s> thank you for marmion <\s>
<s> i think your end has been attained <\s>
<s> that it is not the end which i should wish you to propose to yourself you will be well aware from what you know of my notions of composition both as to matter and manner <\s>
<s> in the circle of my acquaintance it seems as well liked as the lay though i have heard that in the world it is not so <\s>
<s> had the poem been much better than the lay it could scarcely have satisfied the public which has too much of the monster the moral monster in its composition <\s>
<s> the spring has burst out upon us all at once and the vale is now in exquisite beauty a gentle shower has fallen this morning and i hear the thrush who has built in my orchard singing amain <\s>
<s> how happy we should be to see you here again <\s>

<s> my dear wrangham in what are you employed i mean by way of amusement and relaxation from your professional duties <\s>
<s> is there any topographical history of your neighbourhood <\s>
<s> i remember reading white's natural history and antiquities of selbourne with great pleasure when a boy at school and i have lately read dr <\s>
<s> whitaker's history of craven and whalley both with profit and pleasure <\s>
<s> would it not be worth your while to give some of your leisure hours to a work of this kind making those works partly your model and adding thereto from the originality of your own mind <\s>
<s> with your activity you might produce something of this kind of general interest taking for your limit any division in your neighbourhood natural ecclesiastical or civil suppose for example the coast from the borders of cleveland or from scarborough to spurnhead and inward into the country to any boundary that you might approve of <\s>
<s> pray think of this <\s>
<s> i am induced to mention it from belief that you are admirably qualified for such a work that it would pleasantly employ your leisure hours and from a regret in seeing works of this kind which might be made so very interesting utterly marred by falling into the hands of wretched bunglers e g the history of cleveland which i have just read by a clergyman of the most heavy performance i ever encountered and what an interesting district <\s>

<s> your sermon did not reach me till the night before last we have all read it and are much pleased with it <\s>
<s> upon the whole i like it better than the last it must have been heard with great interest <\s>
<s> i differ however from you in a few particulars <\s>
<s> the spaniards devoting themselves for an imprisoned bourbon or the crumbling relics of the inquisition <\s>
<s> this is very fair for pointing a sentence but it is not the truth <\s>
<s> they have told us over and over again that they are fighting against a foreign tyrant who has dealt with them most perfidiously and inhumanly who must hate them for their worth and on account of the injuries they have received from him and whom they must hate accordingly against a ruler over whom they could have no control and for one whom they have told us they will establish as a sovereign of a free people and therefore must he himself be a limited monarch <\s>
<s> you will permit me to make to you this representation for its truth's sake and because it gives me an opportunity of letting out a secret viz <\s>
<s> that i myself am very deep in this subject and about to publish upon it first i believe in a newspaper for the sake of immediate and wide circulation and next the same matter in a separate pamphlet under the title of the convention of cintra brought to the test of principles and the people of great britain vindicated from the charge of having prejudged it <\s>
<s> you will wonder to hear me talk of principles when i have told you that i also do not go along with you in your sentiments respecting the roman catholic question <\s>
<s> i confess i am not prepared to see the roman catholic religion as the established church of ireland and how that can be consistently refused to them if other things are granted on the plea of their being the majority i do not see <\s>
<s> certainly this demand will follow and how would it be answered <\s>
<s> there is yet another circumstance in which i differ from you <\s>
<s> bell's plan of education be of that importance which it appears to be of it cannot be a matter of indifference whether he or lancaster have a rightful claim to the invention <\s>
<s> for heaven's sake let all benefactors of their species have the honour due to them <\s>
<s> virgil gives a high place in elysium to the improvers of life and it is neither the least philosophical or least poetical passage of the aeneid 58 these points of difference being stated i may say that in other things i greatly approve both of the matter and manner of your sermon <\s>
<s> do not fail to return my best thanks to the lady to whom i am obliged for the elegant and accurate drawing of broughton church <\s>
<s> i should have written to thank her and you for it immediately but i foresaw that i should have occasion to write to you on this or other business <\s>

<s> the convention of cintra the roman catholics <\s>
<s> my dear wrangham you will think i am afraid that i have used you ill in not replying sooner to your last letter particularly as you were desirous to be informed in what newspaper my pamphlet was printing <\s>
<s> i should not have failed to give you immediately any information upon this subject which could be of use but in fact though i began to publish in a newspaper viz <\s>
<s> the courier an accidental loss of two or three sheets of the manuscript prevented me from going on in that mode of publication after two sections had appeared <\s>
<s> the pamphlet will be out in less than a fortnight entitled at full length concerning the relations of great britain spain and portugal to each other and to the common enemy at this crisis and specifically as affected by the convention of cintra the whole brought to the test of those principles by which alone the independence and freedom of nations can be preserved or recovered <\s>
<s> this is less a title than a table of contents <\s>
<s> i give it you at full length in order that you may set your fancy at work if you have no better employment for it upon what the pamphlet may contain <\s>

<s> what i have written has been done according to the best light of my conscience it is indeed very imperfect and will i fear be little read but if it is read cannot i hope fail of doing some good though i am aware it will create me a world of enemies and call forth the old yell of jacobinism <\s>
<s> i have not sent it to any personal friends as such therefore i have made no exception in your case <\s>
<s> were too well founded his own ship was lost while under the management of the pilot whether mismanaged by him or not i do not know but know for certain which is indeed our great consolation that our dear brother did all that man could do even to the sacrifice of his own life <\s>
<s> the newspaper accounts were grossly inaccurate indeed that must have been obvious to any person who could bear to think upon the subject for they were absolutely unintelligible <\s>
<s> there are two pamphlets upon the subject one a mere transcript from the papers the other may be considered as to all important particulars as of authority it is by a person high in the india house and contains the deposition of the surviving officers concerning the loss of the ship <\s>
<s> the pamphlet i am told is most unfeelingly written i have only seen an extract from it containing gilpin's deposition the fourth mate <\s>
<s> from this it appears that every thing was done that could be done under the circumstances for the safety of the lives and the ship <\s>
<s> my poor brother was standing on the hen coop which is placed upon the poop and is the most commanding situation in the vessel when she went down and he was thence washed overboard by a large sea which sank the ship <\s>
<s> he was seen struggling with the waves some time afterwards having laid hold it is said of a rope <\s>
<s> he was an excellent swimmer but what could it avail in such a sea encumbered with his clothes and exhausted in body as he must have been <\s>
<s> for myself i feel that there is something cut out of my life which cannot be restored <\s>
<s> i never thought of him but with hope and delight we looked forward to the time not distant as we thought when he would settle near us when the task of his life would be over and he would have nothing to do but reap his reward <\s>
<s> by that time i hoped also that the chief part of my labours would be executed and that i should be able to show him that he had not placed a false confidence in me <\s>
<s> i never wrote a line without a thought of its giving him pleasure my writings printed and manuscript were his delight and one of the chief solaces of his long voyages <\s>
<s> but let me stop i will not be cast down were it only for his sake i will not be dejected <\s>
<s> i have much yet to do and pray god to give me strength and power his part of the agreement between us is brought to an end mine continues and i hope when i shall be able to think of him with a calmer mind that the remembrance of him dead will even animate me more than the joy which i had in him living <\s>
<s> i wish you would procure the pamphlet i have mentioned you may know the right one by its having a motto from shakspeare from clarence's dream <\s>

<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>
<s> this dryden has spoiled <\s>
<s> he says first very well the faults of love by love are justified and then come four lines of miserable rant quite ?la maximin <\s>

<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>

<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>

<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>
<s> this dryden has spoiled <\s>
<s> he says first very well the faults of love by love are justified and then come four lines of miserable rant quite ?la maximin <\s>

<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>

<s> letter to sir walter scott 55 55 from lockhart's life of scott vol <\s>
<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>
<s> this dryden has spoiled <\s>
<s> he says first very well the faults of love by love are justified and then come four lines of miserable rant quite ?la maximin <\s>

<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>
<s> this dryden has spoiled <\s>
<s> he says first very well the faults of love by love are justified and then come four lines of miserable rant quite ?la maximin <\s>

<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>

<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>
<s> this dryden has spoiled <\s>
<s> he says first very well the faults of love by love are justified and then come four lines of miserable rant quite ?la maximin <\s>

<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>

<s> letter to sir walter scott 55 55 from lockhart's life of scott vol <\s>
<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>
<s> this dryden has spoiled <\s>
<s> he says first very well the faults of love by love are justified and then come four lines of miserable rant quite ?la maximin <\s>

<s> letter to sir walter scott 55 55 from lockhart's life of scott vol <\s>
<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>
<s> this dryden has spoiled <\s>
<s> he says first very well the faults of love by love are justified and then come four lines of miserable rant quite ?la maximin <\s>

<s> extract of letter to sir walter scott 1808 <\s>

<s> i think your end has been attained <\s>
<s> that it is not the end which i should wish you to propose to yourself you will be well aware from what you know of my notions of composition both as to matter and manner <\s>
<s> in the circle of my acquaintance it seems as well liked as the lay though i have heard that in the world it is not so <\s>
<s> had the poem been much better than the lay it could scarcely have satisfied the public which has too much of the monster the moral monster in its composition <\s>

<s> they have told us over and over again that they are fighting against a foreign tyrant who has dealt with them most perfidiously and inhumanly who must hate them for their worth and on account of the injuries they have received from him and whom they must hate accordingly against a ruler over whom they could have no control and for one whom they have told us they will establish as a sovereign of a free people and therefore must he himself be a limited monarch <\s>

<s> you will wonder to hear me talk of principles when i have told you that i also do not go along with you in your sentiments respecting the roman catholic question <\s>

<s> there is yet another circumstance in which i differ from you <\s>
<s> bell's plan of education be of that importance which it appears to be of it cannot be a matter of indifference whether he or lancaster have a rightful claim to the invention <\s>
<s> for heaven's sake let all benefactors of their species have the honour due to them <\s>

<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>
<s> this dryden has spoiled <\s>
<s> he says first very well the faults of love by love are justified and then come four lines of miserable rant quite ?la maximin <\s>

<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>

<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>

<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>
<s> this dryden has spoiled <\s>
<s> he says first very well the faults of love by love are justified and then come four lines of miserable rant quite ?la maximin <\s>

<s> my dear scott i was much pleased to hear of your engagement with dryden not that he is as a poet any great favourite of mine <\s>
<s> i admire his talents and genius highly but his is not a poetical genius <\s>
<s> the only qualities i can find in dryden that are essentially poetical are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind with an excellent ear <\s>
<s> it may seem strange that i do not add to this great command of language <\s>
<s> that he certainly has and of such language too as it is most desirable that a poet should possess or rather that he should not be without <\s>
<s> but it is not language that is in the highest sense of the word poetical being neither of the imagination nor of the passions i mean the amiable the ennobling or the intense passions <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that there is nothing of this in dryden but as little i think as is possible considering how much he has written <\s>
<s> you will easily understand my meaning when i refer to his versification of palamon and arcite as contrasted with the language of chaucer <\s>
<s> dryden had neither a tender heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity <\s>
<s> whenever his language is poetically impassioned it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects such as the follies vices and crimes of classes of men or of individuals <\s>
<s> that his cannot be the language of imagination must have necessarily followed from this that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his works and in his translation from virgil whenever virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object dryden always spoils the passage <\s>
<s> but too much of this i am glad that you are to be his editor <\s>
<s> his political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration and even absolutely require it <\s>
<s> a correct text is the first object of an editor then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages and lastly which is much less important notes pointing out authors to whom the poet has been indebted not in the fiddling way of phrase here and phrase there which is detestable as a general practice but where he has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner <\s>
<s> if i can be of any use to you do not fail to apply to me <\s>
<s> one thing i may take the liberty to suggest which is when you come to the fables might it not be advisable to print the whole of the tales of boccace in a smaller type in the original language <\s>
<s> if this should look too much like swelling a book i should certainly make such extracts as would show where dryden has most strikingly improved upon or fallen below his original <\s>
<s> i think his translations from boccace are the best at least the most poetical of his poems <\s>
<s> it is many years since i saw boccace but i remember that sigismunda is not married by him to guiscard the names are different in boccace in both tales i believe certainly in theodore c <\s>
<s> i think dryden has much injured the story by the marriage and degraded sigismunda's character by it <\s>
<s> he has also to the best of my remembrance degraded her still more by making her love absolute sensuality and appetite dryden had no other notion of the passion <\s>
<s> with all these defects and they are very gross ones it is a noble poem <\s>
<s> guiscard's answer when first reproached by tancred is noble in boccace nothing but this amor pu?molto pi√π che ne roi ne io possiamo <\s>
<s> this dryden has spoiled <\s>
<s> he says first very well the faults of love by love are justified and then come four lines of miserable rant quite ?la maximin <\s>
<s> farewell and believe me ever your affectionate friend william wordsworth <\s>
<s> extract of letter to sir walter scott 1808 <\s>
<s> thank you for marmion <\s>
<s> i think your end has been attained <\s>
<s> that it is not the end which i should wish you to propose to yourself you will be well aware from what you know of my notions of composition both as to matter and manner <\s>
<s> in the circle of my acquaintance it seems as well liked as the lay though i have heard that in the world it is not so <\s>
<s> had the poem been much better than the lay it could scarcely have satisfied the public which has too much of the monster the moral monster in its composition <\s>
<s> the spring has burst out upon us all at once and the vale is now in exquisite beauty a gentle shower has fallen this morning and i hear the thrush who has built in my orchard singing amain <\s>
<s> how happy we should be to see you here again <\s>
<s> ever my dear scott your sincere friend w <\s>
<s> francis wrangham hunmanby near bridlington yorkshire <\s>
<s> my dear wrangham in what are you employed i mean by way of amusement and relaxation from your professional duties <\s>
<s> is there any topographical history of your neighbourhood <\s>
<s> i remember reading white's natural history and antiquities of selbourne with great pleasure when a boy at school and i have lately read dr <\s>
<s> whitaker's history of craven and whalley both with profit and pleasure <\s>
<s> would it not be worth your while to give some of your leisure hours to a work of this kind making those works partly your model and adding thereto from the originality of your own mind <\s>
<s> with your activity you might produce something of this kind of general interest taking for your limit any division in your neighbourhood natural ecclesiastical or civil suppose for example the coast from the borders of cleveland or from scarborough to spurnhead and inward into the country to any boundary that you might approve of <\s>
<s> pray think of this <\s>
<s> i am induced to mention it from belief that you are admirably qualified for such a work that it would pleasantly employ your leisure hours and from a regret in seeing works of this kind which might be made so very interesting utterly marred by falling into the hands of wretched bunglers e g the history of cleveland which i have just read by a clergyman of the most heavy performance i ever encountered and what an interesting district <\s>

<s> your sermon did not reach me till the night before last we have all read it and are much pleased with it <\s>
<s> upon the whole i like it better than the last it must have been heard with great interest <\s>
<s> i differ however from you in a few particulars <\s>
<s> the spaniards devoting themselves for an imprisoned bourbon or the crumbling relics of the inquisition <\s>
<s> this is very fair for pointing a sentence but it is not the truth <\s>
<s> they have told us over and over again that they are fighting against a foreign tyrant who has dealt with them most perfidiously and inhumanly who must hate them for their worth and on account of the injuries they have received from him and whom they must hate accordingly against a ruler over whom they could have no control and for one whom they have told us they will establish as a sovereign of a free people and therefore must he himself be a limited monarch <\s>
<s> you will permit me to make to you this representation for its truth's sake and because it gives me an opportunity of letting out a secret viz <\s>
<s> that i myself am very deep in this subject and about to publish upon it first i believe in a newspaper for the sake of immediate and wide circulation and next the same matter in a separate pamphlet under the title of the convention of cintra brought to the test of principles and the people of great britain vindicated from the charge of having prejudged it <\s>
<s> you will wonder to hear me talk of principles when i have told you that i also do not go along with you in your sentiments respecting the roman catholic question <\s>
<s> i confess i am not prepared to see the roman catholic religion as the established church of ireland and how that can be consistently refused to them if other things are granted on the plea of their being the majority i do not see <\s>
<s> certainly this demand will follow and how would it be answered <\s>
<s> there is yet another circumstance in which i differ from you <\s>
<s> bell's plan of education be of that importance which it appears to be of it cannot be a matter of indifference whether he or lancaster have a rightful claim to the invention <\s>
<s> for heaven's sake let all benefactors of their species have the honour due to them <\s>
<s> virgil gives a high place in elysium to the improvers of life and it is neither the least philosophical or least poetical passage of the aeneid 58 these points of difference being stated i may say that in other things i greatly approve both of the matter and manner of your sermon <\s>
<s> do not fail to return my best thanks to the lady to whom i am obliged for the elegant and accurate drawing of broughton church <\s>
<s> i should have written to thank her and you for it immediately but i foresaw that i should have occasion to write to you on this or other business <\s>

<s> wordsworth 59 58 quique sui memores alios fecere merendo <\s>
<s> the convention of cintra the roman catholics <\s>
<s> my dear wrangham you will think i am afraid that i have used you ill in not replying sooner to your last letter particularly as you were desirous to be informed in what newspaper my pamphlet was printing <\s>
<s> i should not have failed to give you immediately any information upon this subject which could be of use but in fact though i began to publish in a newspaper viz <\s>
<s> the courier an accidental loss of two or three sheets of the manuscript prevented me from going on in that mode of publication after two sections had appeared <\s>
<s> the pamphlet will be out in less than a fortnight entitled at full length concerning the relations of great britain spain and portugal to each other and to the common enemy at this crisis and specifically as affected by the convention of cintra the whole brought to the test of those principles by which alone the independence and freedom of nations can be preserved or recovered <\s>
<s> this is less a title than a table of contents <\s>
<s> i give it you at full length in order that you may set your fancy at work if you have no better employment for it upon what the pamphlet may contain <\s>
<s> i sent off the last sheets only a day or two since else i should have written to you sooner it having been my intention to pay my debt to you the moment i had discharged this debt to my country <\s>
<s> what i have written has been done according to the best light of my conscience it is indeed very imperfect and will i fear be little read but if it is read cannot i hope fail of doing some good though i am aware it will create me a world of enemies and call forth the old yell of jacobinism <\s>
<s> i have not sent it to any personal friends as such therefore i have made no exception in your case <\s>
<s> were too well founded his own ship was lost while under the management of the pilot whether mismanaged by him or not i do not know but know for certain which is indeed our great consolation that our dear brother did all that man could do even to the sacrifice of his own life <\s>
<s> the newspaper accounts were grossly inaccurate indeed that must have been obvious to any person who could bear to think upon the subject for they were absolutely unintelligible <\s>
<s> there are two pamphlets upon the subject one a mere transcript from the papers the other may be considered as to all important particulars as of authority it is by a person high in the india house and contains the deposition of the surviving officers concerning the loss of the ship <\s>
<s> the pamphlet i am told is most unfeelingly written i have only seen an extract from it containing gilpin's deposition the fourth mate <\s>
<s> from this it appears that every thing was done that could be done under the circumstances for the safety of the lives and the ship <\s>
<s> my poor brother was standing on the hen coop which is placed upon the poop and is the most commanding situation in the vessel when she went down and he was thence washed overboard by a large sea which sank the ship <\s>
<s> he was seen struggling with the waves some time afterwards having laid hold it is said of a rope <\s>
<s> he was an excellent swimmer but what could it avail in such a sea encumbered with his clothes and exhausted in body as he must have been <\s>
<s> for myself i feel that there is something cut out of my life which cannot be restored <\s>
<s> i never thought of him but with hope and delight we looked forward to the time not distant as we thought when he would settle near us when the task of his life would be over and he would have nothing to do but reap his reward <\s>
<s> by that time i hoped also that the chief part of my labours would be executed and that i should be able to show him that he had not placed a false confidence in me <\s>
<s> i never wrote a line without a thought of its giving him pleasure my writings printed and manuscript were his delight and one of the chief solaces of his long voyages <\s>
<s> but let me stop i will not be cast down were it only for his sake i will not be dejected <\s>
<s> i have much yet to do and pray god to give me strength and power his part of the agreement between us is brought to an end mine continues and i hope when i shall be able to think of him with a calmer mind that the remembrance of him dead will even animate me more than the joy which i had in him living <\s>
<s> i wish you would procure the pamphlet i have mentioned you may know the right one by its having a motto from shakspeare from clarence's dream <\s>
<s> i wish you to see it that you may read g s statement and be enabled if the affair should ever be mentioned in your hearing to correct the errors which they must have fallen into who have taken their ideas from the newspaper accounts <\s>
<s> i have dwelt long too long i fear upon this subject but i could not write to you upon any thing else till i had unburthened my heart <\s>
<s> we have great consolations from the sources you allude to but alas <\s>
<s> we have much yet to endure <\s>

<s> hill in explanation of the title in which he appears in the walpurgisnacht had published an account of his phantasmal illusions pointing them against fichte's system of idealism which he evidently confounded with what coleridge would have called subjective idolism <\s>

<s> that sung by the robbers is worthy of a thug it goes beyond our notions of any european bandit and transports us to the land of jaggernat <\s>
<s> 233 the works of bürger who was born on the first day of 1748 died june 8 1794 consist of poems 2 vols macbeth altered from shakespeare pronounced by taylor no good judge of shakespeare in some respects superiour to the original munchaüsen's travels translations of the six first books of the iliad and some others ); papers philological and political <\s>
<s> his fame rests chiefly on three ballads the wild hunter the parson's daughter and lenore <\s>
<s> the powerful diction and admirable harmony rhythm sound rhyme of these compositions mr <\s>
<s> taylor describes as the result of laborious art it strikes me from the outline which he has given of bürger's history that the violent feelings the life like expression of which constitutes their power and value may have been partly the reflex of the poet's own mind <\s>
<s> his seems to have been a life of mismanagement from youth till middle age <\s>
<s> like milton he lost a beloved second wife by childbed in the first year of marriage like him he married a third time but without his special necessity blindness and unkind daughters <\s>
<s> he wedded a lady who had fallen in love with his poetry or perhaps his poetical reputation an union founded as it appears in vanity ended in vexation of spirit and as death which had deprived him of two wives did not release him from a third he obtained his freedom at the end of little more than three years from a court of justice <\s>
<s> why did klopstock undervalue by preference of such a poet the lofty minded schiller the dearest to england of all german bards perhaps because the author of wallenstein was a philosopher and had many things in his philosophy which the author of the messiah could not find in his heaven and earth <\s>
<s> he spoke very slightingly of kotzebue as an immoral author in the first place and next as deficient in power <\s>
<s> at vienna said he they are transported with him but we do not reckon the people of vienna either the wisest or the wittiest people of germany <\s>
<s> he said wieland was a charming author and a sovereign master of his own language that in this respect goethe could not be compared to him nor indeed could any body else <\s>
<s> he said that his fault was to be fertile to exuberance <\s>
<s> i told him the oberon had just been translated into english <\s>
<s> he asked me if i was not delighted with the poem <\s>
<s> i answered that i thought the story began to flag about the seventh or eighth book and observed that it was unworthy of a man of genius to make the interest of a long poem turn entirely upon animal gratification <\s>
<s> he seemed at first disposed to excuse this by saying that there are different subjects for poetry and that poets are not willing to be restricted in their choice <\s>
<s> i answered that i thought the passion of love as well suited to the purposes of poetry as any other passion but that it was a cheap way of pleasing to fix the attention of the reader through a long poem on the mere appetite <\s>
<s> but said he you see that such poems please every body <\s>
<s> i answered that it was the province of a great poet to raise people up to his own level not to descend to theirs <\s>
<s> he agreed and confessed that on no account whatsoever would he have written a work like the oberon <\s>
<s> he spoke in raptures of wieland's style and pointed out the passage where retzia is delivered of her child as exquisitely beautiful 234 234 oberon canto viii <\s>
<s> the little touch about the new born babe's returning its mother's kiss is very romantic though put modestly in the form of a query und scheint nicht jeden kuss sein kleiner mund dem ihren zu entsaugen <\s>
<s> the word entsaugen suck off is expressive it very naturally characterises the kiss of an infant five minutes of age <\s>
<s> wieland had great nursery experience <\s>
<s> my sweetest hours says he in a letter quoted in the survey are those in which i see about me in all their glee of childhood my whole posse of little half way things between apes and angels <\s>
<s> sotheby's translation of the oberon made the poem popular in this country <\s>
<s> the original first appeared in 1780 <\s>
<s> i said that i did not perceive any very striking passages but that i made allowance for the imperfections of a translation <\s>
<s> of the thefts of wieland he said they were so exquisitely managed that the greatest writers might be proud to steal as he did <\s>
<s> he considered the books and fables of old romance writers in the light of the ancient mythology as a sort of common property from which a man was free to take whatever he could make a good use of <\s>
<s> an englishman had presented him with the odes of collins which he had read with pleasure <\s>
<s> he knew little or nothing of gray except his elegy written in a country church yard <\s>
<s> he complained of the fool in lear <\s>
<s> i observed that he seemed to give a terrible wildness to the distress but still he complained <\s>
<s> he asked whether it was not allowed that pope had written rhymed poetry with more skill than any of our writers i said i preferred dryden because his couplets had greater variety in their movement <\s>
<s> he thought my reason a good one but asked whether the rhyme of pope were not more exact <\s>
<s> this question i understood as applying to the final terminations and observed to him that i believed it was the case but that i thought it was easy to excuse some inaccuracy in the final sounds if the general sweep of the verse was superiour <\s>
<s> i told him that we were not so exact with regard to the final endings of lines as the french <\s>
<s> he did not seem to know that we made no distinction between masculine and feminine i e <\s>
<s> single or double rhymes at least he put inquiries to me on this subject <\s>
<s> he seemed to think that no language could be so far formed as that it might not be enriched by idioms borrowed from another tongue <\s>
<s> i said this was a very dangerous practice and added that i thought milton had often injured both his prose and verse by taking this liberty too frequently <\s>
<s> i recommended to him the prose works of dryden as models of pure and native english <\s>
<s> i was treading upon tender ground as i have reason to suppose that he has himself liberally indulged in the practice <\s>
<s> the same day i dined at mr <\s>
<s> klopstock's where i had the pleasure of a third interview with the poet <\s>
<s> we talked principally about indifferent things <\s>
<s> i asked him what he thought of kant <\s>
<s> he said that his reputation was much on the decline in germany <\s>
<s> that for his own part he was not surprised to find it so as the works of kant were to him utterly incomprehensible that he had often been pestered by the kanteans but was rarely in the practice of arguing with them <\s>
<s> his custom was to produce the book open it and point to a passage and beg they would explain it <\s>
<s> this they ordinarily attempted to do by substituting their own ideas <\s>
<s> i do not want i say an explanation of your own ideas but of the passage which is before us <\s>
<s> in this way i generally bring the dispute to an immediate conclusion <\s>
<s> he spoke of wolfe as the first metaphysician they had in germany <\s>
<s> wolfe had followers but they could hardly be called a sect and luckily till the appearance of kant about fifteen years ago germany had not been pestered by any sect of philosophers whatsoever but that each man had separately pursued his inquiries uncontrolled by the dogmas of a master <\s>
<s> kant had appeared ambitious to be the founder of a sect that he had succeeded but that the germans were now coming to their senses again <\s>
<s> that nicolai and engel had in different ways contributed to disenchant the nation ;[ 235 but above all the incomprehensibility of the philosopher and his philosophy <\s>
<s> he seemed pleased to hear that as yet kant's doctrines had not met with many admirers in england did not doubt but that we had too much wisdom to be duped by a writer who set at defiance the common sense and common understandings of men <\s>
<s> we talked of tragedy <\s>
<s> he seemed to rate highly the power of exciting tears i said that nothing was more easy than to deluge an audience that it was done every day by the meanest writers <\s>
<s> i must remind you my friend first that these notes are not intended as specimens of klopstock's intellectual power or even colloquial prowess to judge of which by an accidental conversation and this with strangers and those two foreigners would be not only unreasonable but calumnious <\s>
<s> secondly i attribute little other interest to the remarks than what is derived from the celebrity of the person who made them <\s>
<s> lastly if you ask me whether i have read the messiah and what i think of it <\s>
<s> i answer as yet the first four books only and as to my opinion the reasons of which hereafter you may guess it from what i could not help muttering to myself when the good pastor this morning told me that klopstock was the german milton  'a very german milton indeed heaven preserve you and s t <\s>
<s> 235 these disenchanters put one in mind of the ratcatchers who are said and supposed to rid houses of rats and yet the rats somehow or other continue to swarm <\s>
<s> the kantean rats were not aware i believe when klopstock spoke thus of the extermination that had befallen them and even to this day those acute animals infest the old house and steal away the daily bread of the children if the old notions of space and time and the old proofs of religious verities by way of the understanding and speculative reason must be called such <\s>
<s> whether or no these are their true spiritual sustenance or the necessary guard and vehicle of it is perhaps a question <\s>
<s> but who were nicolai and engel and what did they against the famous enchanter <\s>
<s> the former was born in 1733 at berlin where he carried on his father's business of book selling pursued literature with marked success and attained to old age full of literary honours <\s>
<s> by means of three critical journals the literatur briefe the bibliothek der schönen wissenschaftern and the allgemeine deutsche bibliothek which he conducted with the powerful cooperation of lessing and of his intimate friend mendelssohn and to which he contributed largely himself he became very considerable in the german world of letters and so continued for the space of twenty years <\s>
<s> jördens in his lexicon speaks highly of the effect of nicolai's writings in promoting freedom of thought enlightened views in theology and philosophy and a sound taste in fine literature describes him as a brave battler with intolerance hypocrisy and confused conceptions in religion with empty subtleties obscurities and terminologies that can but issue in vain fantasies in his controversial writings on the so named critical philosophy <\s>
<s> he engaged with the kritik der reinen vernunft on its appearance in 1781 in the allgemeine deutsche bibliothek first explained his objections to it in the 11th vol <\s>
<s> of his reisebeschreibung description of a journey through germany and switzerland in the year 1781 and afterwards in his romance entitled the life and opinions of sempronius gundibert a german philosopher sought to set forth the childish crotchets and abuses imputable to many disciples of this philosophy in their native absurdity <\s>
<s> the ratsbone alluded to by klopstock was doubtless contained in the above named romance which the old poet probably esteemed more than nicolai's more serious polemics <\s>
<s> gundibert has had its day but in a fiction destined to a day of longer duration goethe's faust the satirist is himself most effectively satirised <\s>
<s> there he is in that strange yet beautiful temple pinned to the wall in a ridiculous attitude to be laughed at as long as the temple itself is visited and admired <\s>
<s> this doom came upon him not so much for his campaign against the kanteans as for his joys of werter because he had dared to ridicule a book which certainly offered no small temptations to the parodist <\s>
<s> indeed he seems to have been engaged in a series of hostilities with fichte lavater wieland herder and goethe <\s>

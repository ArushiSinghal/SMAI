<s> winding among the lawny islands fair whose blosmy forests starred the shadowy deep the wingless boat paused where an ivory stair its fretwork in the crystal sea did steep 580 encircling that vast fane's aerial heap we disembarked and through a portal wide we passed whose roof of moonstone carved did keep a glimmering o'er the forms on every side sculptures like life and thought immovable deep eyed <\s>

<s> beneath there sate on many a sapphire throne the great who had departed from mankind 605 a mighty senate some whose white hair shone like mountain snow mild beautiful and blind some female forms whose gestures beamed with mind and ardent youths and children bright and fair and some had lyres whose strings were intertwined 610 with pale and clinging flames which ever there waked faint yet thrilling sounds that pierced the crystal air <\s>

<s> a child most infantine yet wandering far beyond that innocent age in all but its sweet looks and mien divine even then methought with the world's tyrant rage a patient warfare thy young heart did wage 860 when those soft eyes of scarcely conscious thought some tale or thine own fancies would engage to overflow with tears or converse fraught with passion o'er their depths its fleeting light had wrought <\s>
<s> she moved upon this earth a shape of brightness 865 a power that from its objects scarcely drew one impulse of her being in her lightness most like some radiant cloud of morning dew which wanders through the waste air's pathless blue to nourish some far desert she did seem 870 beside me gathering beauty as she grew like the bright shade of some immortal dream which walks when tempest sleeps the wave of life's dark stream <\s>
<s> as mine own shadow was this child to me a second self far dearer and more fair 875 which clothed in undissolving radiancy all those steep paths which languor and despair of human things had made so dark and bare but which i trod alone nor till bereft of friends and overcome by lonely care 880 knew i what solace for that loss was left though by a bitter wound my trusting heart was cleft <\s>
<s> once she was dear now she was all i had to love in human life this playmate sweet this child of twelve years old so she was made 885 my sole associate and her willing feet wandered with mine where earth and ocean meet beyond the aereal mountains whose vast cells the unreposing billows ever beat through forests wild and old and lawny dells 890 where boughs of incense droop over the emerald wells <\s>
<s> and warm and light i felt her clasping hand when twined in mine she followed where i went through the lone paths of our immortal land <\s>
<s> it had no waste but some memorial lent 895 which strung me to my toil some monument vital with mind then cythna by my side until the bright and beaming day were spent would rest with looks entreating to abide too earnest and too sweet ever to be denied <\s>

<s> and in the murmur of her dreams was heard 910 sometimes the name of laon suddenly she would arise and like the secret bird whom sunset wakens fill the shore and sky with her sweet accents a wild melody <\s>
<s> hymns which my soul had woven to freedom strong 915 the source of passion whence they rose to be triumphant strains which like a spirit's tongue to the enchanted waves that child of glory sung 29 <\s>
<s> her white arms lifted through the shadowy stream of her loose hair <\s>
<s> oh excellently great 920 seemed to me then my purpose the vast theme of those impassioned songs when cythna sate amid the calm which rapture doth create after its tumult her heart vibrating her spirit o'er the ocean's floating state 925 from her deep eyes far wandering on the wing of visions that were mine beyond its utmost spring <\s>

<s> and this beloved child thus felt the sway of my conceptions gathering like a cloud the very wind on which it rolls away hers too were all my thoughts ere yet endowed 940 with music and with light their fountains flowed in poesy and her still and earnest face pallid with feelings which intensely glowed within was turned on mine with speechless grace watching the hopes which there her heart had learned to trace <\s>
<s> in me communion with this purest being kindled intenser zeal and made me wise in knowledge which in hers mine own mind seeing left in the human world few mysteries how without fear of evil or disguise 950 was cythna what a spirit strong and mild which death or pain or peril could despise yet melt in tenderness <\s>

<s> nor are the strong and the severe to keep the empire of the world thus cythna taught 965 even in the visions of her eloquent sleep unconscious of the power through which she wrought the woof of such intelligible thought as from the tranquil strength which cradled lay in her smile peopled rest my spirit sought 970 why the deceiver and the slave has sway o'er heralds so divine of truth's arising day <\s>

<s> i smiled and spake not wherefore dost thou smile at what i say <\s>

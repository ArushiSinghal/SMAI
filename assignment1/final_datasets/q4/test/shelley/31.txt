<s> this crowd is safer than the silent wood where love's own doubts disturb the solitude on frozen hearts the fiery rain of wine falls and the dew of music more divine 115 tempers the deep emotions of the time to spirits cradled in a sunny clime how many meet who never yet have met to part too soon but never to forget <\s>
<s> how many saw the beauty power and wit 120 of looks and words which ne'er enchanted yet but life's familiar veil was now withdrawn as the world leaps before an earthquake's dawn and unprophetic of the coming hours the matin winds from the expanded flowers 125 scatter their hoarded incense and awaken the earth until the dewy sleep is shaken from every living heart which it possesses through seas and winds cities and wildernesses as if the future and the past were all 130 treasured i the instant so gherardi's hall laughed in the mirth of its lord's festival till some one asked 'where is the bride <\s>
<s> and then a bridesmaid went and ere she came again a silence fell upon the guests a pause 135 of expectation as when beauty awes all hearts with its approach though unbeheld then wonder and then fear that wonder quelled for whispers passed from mouth to ear which drew the colour from the hearer's cheeks and flew 140 louder and swifter round the company and then gherardi entered with an eye of ostentatious trouble and a crowd surrounded him and some were weeping loud <\s>
<s> they found ginevra dead <\s>
<s> if it be death 145 to lie without motion or pulse or breath with waxen cheeks and limbs cold stiff and white and open eyes whose fixed and glassy light mocked at the speculation they had owned <\s>
<s> if it be death when there is felt around 150 a smell of clay a pale and icy glare and silence and a sense that lifts the hair from the scalp to the ankles as it were corruption from the spirit passing forth and giving all it shrouded to the earth 155 and leaving as swift lightning in its flight ashes and smoke and darkness in our night of thought we know thus much of death no more than the unborn dream of our life before their barks are wrecked on its inhospitable shore <\s>
<s> 160 the marriage feast and its solemnity was turned to funeral pomp the company with heavy hearts and looks broke up nor they who loved the dead went weeping on their way alone but sorrow mixed with sad surprise 165 loosened the springs of pity in all eyes on which that form whose fate they weep in vain will never thought they kindle smiles again <\s>
<s> the lamps which half extinguished in their haste gleamed few and faint o'er the abandoned feast 170 showed as it were within the vaulted room a cloud of sorrow hanging as if gloom had passed out of men's minds into the air <\s>
<s> some few yet stood around gherardi there friends and relations of the dead and he 175 a loveless man accepted torpidly the consolation that he wanted not awe in the place of grief within him wrought <\s>
<s> their whispers made the solemn silence seem more still some wept ... <\s>
<s> 180 some melted into tears without a sob and some with hearts that might be heard to throb leaned on the table and at intervals shuddered to hear through the deserted halls and corridors the thrilling shrieks which came 185 upon the breeze of night that shook the flame of every torch and taper as it swept from out the chamber where the women kept their tears fell on the dear companion cold of pleasures now departed then was knolled 190 the bell of death and soon the priests arrived and finding death their penitent had shrived returned like ravens from a corpse whereon a vulture has just feasted to the bone <\s>
<s> and then the mourning women came 195 ... <\s>
<s> old winter was gone in his weakness back to the mountains hoar and the spring came down from the planet that hovers upon the shore where the sea of sunlight encroaches 200 on the limits of wintry night if the land and the air and the sea rejoice not when spring approaches we did not rejoice in thee ginevra <\s>
<s> 205 she is still she is cold on the bridal couch one step to the white deathbed and one to the bier and one to the charnel and one oh where <\s>
<s> 210 the dark arrow fled in the noon <\s>
<s> ere the sun through heaven once more has rolled the rats in her heart will have made their nest 215 and the worms be alive in her golden hair while the spirit that guides the sun sits throned in his flaming chair she shall sleep <\s>

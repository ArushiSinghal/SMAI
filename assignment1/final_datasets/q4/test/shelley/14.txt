<s> beatrice but i remember two miles on this side of the fort the road crosses a deep ravine tis rough and narrow 245 and winds with short turns down the precipice and in its depth there is a mighty rock which has from unimaginable years sustained itself with terror and with toil over a gulf and with the agony 250 with which it clings seems slowly coming down even as a wretched soul hour after hour clings to the mass of life yet clinging leans and leaning makes more dark the dread abyss in which it fears to fall beneath this crag 255 huge as despair as if in weariness the melancholy mountain yawns ... below you hear but see not an impetuous torrent raging among the caverns and a bridge crosses the chasm and high above there grow 260 with intersecting trunks from crag to crag cedars and yews and pines whose tangled hair is matted in one solid roof of shade by the dark ivy's twine <\s>
<s> at noonday here tis twilight and at sunset blackest night <\s>

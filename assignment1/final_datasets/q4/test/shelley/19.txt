<s> at first she lived alone in this wild home and her own thoughts were each a minister 210 clothing themselves or with the ocean foam or with the wind or with the speed of fire to work whatever purposes might come into her mind such power her mighty sire had girt them with whether to fly or run 215 through all the regions which he shines upon <\s>
<s> the ocean nymphs and hamadryades oreads and naiads with long weedy locks offered to do her bidding through the seas under the earth and in the hollow rocks 220 and far beneath the matted roots of trees and in the gnarled heart of stubborn oaks so they might live for ever in the light of her sweet presence each a satellite <\s>
<s> this may not be the wizard maid replied 225 the fountains where the naiades bedew their shining hair at length are drained and dried the solid oaks forget their strength and strew their latest leaf upon the mountains wide the boundless ocean like a drop of dew 230 will be consumed the stubborn centre must be scattered like a cloud of summer dust <\s>

<s> all day the wizard lady sate aloof spelling out scrolls of dread antiquity 250 under the cavern's fountain lighted roof or broidering the pictured poesy of some high tale upon her growing woof which the sweet splendour of her smiles could dye in hues outshining heaven and ever she 255 added some grace to the wrought poesy <\s>
<s> while on her hearth lay blazing many a piece of sandal wood rare gums and cinnamon men scarcely know how beautiful fire is each flame of it is as a precious stone 260 dissolved in ever moving light and this belongs to each and all who gaze upon <\s>
<s> the witch beheld it not for in her hand she held a woof that dimmed the burning brand <\s>
<s> this lady never slept but lay in trance 265 all night within the fountain as in sleep <\s>
<s> its emerald crags glowed in her beauty's glance through the green splendour of the water deep she saw the constellations reel and dance like fire flies and withal did ever keep 270 the tenour of her contemplations calm with open eyes closed feet and folded palm <\s>
<s> and when the whirlwinds and the clouds descended from the white pinnacles of that cold hill she passed at dewfall to a space extended 275 where in a lawn of flowering asphodel amid a wood of pines and cedars blended there yawned an inextinguishable well of crimson fire full even to the brim and overflowing all the margin trim <\s>
<s> within the which she lay when the fierce war of wintry winds shook that innocuous liquor in many a mimic moon and bearded star o'er woods and lawns the serpent heard it flicker in sleep and dreaming still he crept afar 285 and when the windless snow descended thicker than autumn leaves she watched it as it came melt on the surface of the level flame <\s>
<s> she had a boat which some say vulcan wrought for venus as the chariot of her star 290 but it was found too feeble to be fraught with all the ardours in that sphere which are and so she sold it and apollo bought and gave it to this daughter from a car changed to the fairest and the lightest boat 295 which ever upon mortal stream did float <\s>
<s> and others say that when but three hours old the first born love out of his cradle lept and clove dun chaos with his wings of gold and like a horticultural adept 300 stole a strange seed and wrapped it up in mould and sowed it in his mother's star and kept watering it all the summer with sweet dew and with his wings fanning it as it grew <\s>
<s> the plant grew strong and green the snowy flower 305 fell and the long and gourd like fruit began to turn the light and dew by inward power to its own substance woven tracery ran of light firm texture ribbed and branching o'er the solid rind like a leaf's veined fan 310 of which love scooped this boat and with soft motion piloted it round the circumfluous ocean <\s>
<s> this boat she moored upon her fount and lit a living spirit within all its frame breathing the soul of swiftness into it <\s>
<s> 315 couched on the fountain like a panther tame one of the twain at evan's feet that sit or as on vesta's sceptre a swift flame or on blind homer's heart a winged thought in joyous expectation lay the boat <\s>
<s> then by strange art she kneaded fire and snow together tempering the repugnant mass with liquid love all things together grow through which the harmony of love can pass and a fair shape out of her hands did flow 325 a living image which did far surpass in beauty that bright shape of vital stone which drew the heart out of pygmalion <\s>
<s> a sexless thing it was and in its growth it seemed to have developed no defect 330 of either sex yet all the grace of both in gentleness and strength its limbs were decked the bosom swelled lightly with its full youth the countenance was such as might select some artist that his skill should never die 335 imaging forth such perfect purity <\s>
<s> from its smooth shoulders hung two rapid wings fit to have borne it to the seventh sphere tipped with the speed of liquid lightenings dyed in the ardours of the atmosphere 340 she led her creature to the boiling springs where the light boat was moored and said sit here <\s>
<s> and pointed to the prow and took her seat beside the rudder with opposing feet <\s>
<s> and down the streams which clove those mountains vast 345 around their inland islets and amid the panther peopled forests whose shade cast darkness and odours and a pleasure hid in melancholy gloom the pinnace passed by many a star surrounded pyramid 350 of icy crag cleaving the purple sky and caverns yawning round unfathomably <\s>
<s> the silver noon into that winding dell with slanted gleam athwart the forest tops tempered like golden evening feebly fell 355 a green and glowing light like that which drops from folded lilies in which glow worms dwell when earth over her face night's mantle wraps between the severed mountains lay on high over the stream a narrow rift of sky <\s>
<s> and ever as she went the image lay with folded wings and unawakened eyes and o'er its gentle countenance did play the busy dreams as thick as summer flies chasing the rapid smiles that would not stay 365 and drinking the warm tears and the sweet sighs inhaling which with busy murmur vain they had aroused from that full heart and brain <\s>
<s> and ever down the prone vale like a cloud upon a stream of wind the pinnace went 370 now lingering on the pools in which abode the calm and darkness of the deep content in which they paused now o'er the shallow road of white and dancing waters all besprent with sand and polished pebbles mortal boat 375 in such a shallow rapid could not float <\s>
<s> and down the earthquaking cataracts which shiver their snow like waters into golden air or under chasms unfathomable ever sepulchre them till in their rage they tear 380 a subterranean portal for the river it fled the circling sunbows did upbear its fall down the hoar precipice of spray lighting it far upon its lampless way <\s>
<s> and when the wizard lady would ascend 385 the labyrinths of some many winding vale which to the inmost mountain upward tend she called hermaphroditus and the pale and heavy hue which slumber could extend over its lips and eyes as on the gale 390 a rapid shadow from a slope of grass into the darkness of the stream did pass <\s>
<s> and it unfurled its heaven coloured pinions with stars of fire spotting the stream below and from above into the sun's dominions 395 flinging a glory like the golden glow in which spring clothes her emerald winged minions all interwoven with fine feathery snow and moonlight splendour of intensest rime with which frost paints the pines in winter time <\s>
<s> and then it winnowed the elysian air which ever hung about that lady bright with its aethereal vans and speeding there like a star up the torrent of the night or a swift eagle in the morning glare 405 breasting the whirlwind with impetuous flight the pinnace oared by those enchanted wings clove the fierce streams towards their upper springs <\s>
<s> the water flashed like sunlight by the prow of a noon wandering meteor flung to heaven 410 the still air seemed as if its waves did flow in tempest down the mountains loosely driven the lady's radiant hair streamed to and fro beneath the billows having vainly striven indignant and impetuous roared to feel 415 the swift and steady motion of the keel <\s>
<s> or when the weary moon was in the wane or in the noon of interlunar night the lady witch in visions could not chain her spirit but sailed forth under the light 420 of shooting stars and bade extend amain its storm outspeeding wings the hermaphrodite she to the austral waters took her way beyond the fabulous thamondocana 48 <\s>
<s> where like a meadow which no scythe has shaven 425 which rain could never bend or whirl blast shake with the antarctic constellations paven canopus and his crew lay the austral lake there she would build herself a windless haven out of the clouds whose moving turrets make 430 the bastions of the storm when through the sky the spirits of the tempest thundered by 49 <\s>
<s> a haven beneath whose translucent floor the tremulous stars sparkled unfathomably and around which the solid vapours hoar 435 based on the level waters to the sky lifted their dreadful crags and like a shore of wintry mountains inaccessibly hemmed in with rifts and precipices gray and hanging crags many a cove and bay <\s>
<s> and whilst the outer lake beneath the lash of the wind's scourge foamed like a wounded thing and the incessant hail with stony clash ploughed up the waters and the flagging wing of the roused cormorant in the lightning flash 445 looked like the wreck of some wind wandering fragment of inky thunder smoke this haven was as a gem to copy heaven engraven 51 <\s>
<s> on which that lady played her many pranks circling the image of a shooting star 450 even as a tiger on hydaspes banks outspeeds the antelopes which speediest are in her light boat and many quips and cranks she played upon the water till the car of the late moon like a sick matron wan 455 to journey from the misty east began <\s>
<s> and then she called out of the hollow turrets of those high clouds white golden and vermilion the armies of her ministering spirits in mighty legions million after million 460 they came each troop emblazoning its merits on meteor flags and many a proud pavilion of the intertexture of the atmosphere they pitched upon the plain of the calm mere <\s>
<s> they framed the imperial tent of their great queen 465 of woven exhalations underlaid with lambent lightning fire as may be seen a dome of thin and open ivory inlaid with crimson silk cressets from the serene hung there and on the water for her tread 470 a tapestry of fleece like mist was strewn dyed in the beams of the ascending moon <\s>
<s> and on a throne o'erlaid with starlight caught upon those wandering isles of aery dew which highest shoals of mountain shipwreck not 475 she sate and heard all that had happened new between the earth and moon since they had brought the last intelligence and now she grew pale as that moon lost in the watery night and now she wept and now she laughed outright <\s>
<s> these were tame pleasures she would often climb the steepest ladder of the crudded rack up to some beaked cape of cloud sublime and like arion on the dolphin's back ride singing through the shoreless air oft time 485 following the serpent lightning's winding track she ran upon the platforms of the wind and laughed to bear the fire balls roar behind <\s>
<s> and sometimes to those streams of upper air which whirl the earth in its diurnal round 490 she would ascend and win the spirits there to let her join their chorus <\s>
<s> mortals found that on those days the sky was calm and fair and mystic snatches of harmonious sound wandered upon the earth where'er she passed 495 and happy thoughts of hope too sweet to last <\s>
<s> but her choice sport was in the hours of sleep to glide adown old nilus where he threads egypt and aethiopia from the steep of utmost axume until he spreads 500 like a calm flock of silver fleeced sheep his waters on the plain and crested heads of cities and proud temples gleam amid and many a vapour belted pyramid <\s>
<s> by moeris and the mareotid lakes 505 strewn with faint blooms like bridal chamber floors where naked boys bridling tame water snakes or charioteering ghastly alligators had left on the sweet waters mighty wakes of those huge forms within the brazen doors 510 of the great labyrinth slept both boy and beast tired with the pomp of their osirian feast <\s>
<s> and where within the surface of the river the shadows of the massy temples lie and never are erased but tremble ever 515 like things which every cloud can doom to die through lotus paven canals and wheresoever the works of man pierced that serenest sky with tombs and towers and fanes twas her delight to wander in the shadow of the night <\s>
<s> with motion like the spirit of that wind whose soft step deepens slumber her light feet passed through the peopled haunts of humankind <\s>
<s> scattering sweet visions from her presence sweet through fane and palace court and labyrinth mined 525 with many a dark and subterranean street under the nile through chambers high and deep she passed observing mortals in their sleep <\s>
<s> a pleasure sweet doubtless it was to see mortals subdued in all the shapes of sleep <\s>
<s> 530 here lay two sister twins in infancy there a lone youth who in his dreams did weep within two lovers linked innocently in their loose locks which over both did creep like ivy from one stem and there lay calm 535 old age with snow bright hair and folded palm <\s>
<s> but other troubled forms of sleep she saw not to be mirrored in a holy song distortions foul of supernatural awe and pale imaginings of visioned wrong 540 and all the code of custom's lawless law written upon the brows of old and young this said the wizard maiden is the strife which stirs the liquid surface of man's life <\s>
<s> and little did the sight disturb her soul 545 we the weak mariners of that wide lake where'er its shores extend or billows roll our course unpiloted and starless make o'er its wild surface to an unknown goal but she in the calm depths her way could take 550 where in bright bowers immortal forms abide beneath the weltering of the restless tide <\s>
<s> and she saw princes couched under the glow of sunlike gems and round each temple court in dormitories ranged row after row 555 she saw the priests asleep all of one sort for all were educated to be so the peasants in their huts and in the port the sailors she saw cradled on the waves and the dead lulled within their dreamless graves <\s>
<s> and all the forms in which those spirits lay were to her sight like the diaphanous veils in which those sweet ladies oft array their delicate limbs who would conceal from us only their scorn of all concealment they 565 move in the light of their own beauty thus <\s>
<s> but these and all now lay with sleep upon them and little thought a witch was looking on them <\s>
<s> she all those human figures breathing there beheld as living spirits to her eyes 570 the naked beauty of the soul lay bare and often through a rude and worn disguise she saw the inner form most bright and fair and then she had a charm of strange device which murmured on mute lips with tender tone 575 could make that spirit mingle with her own <\s>
<s> aurora what wouldst thou have given for such a charm when tithon became gray <\s>
<s> or how much venus of thy silver heaven wouldst thou have yielded ere proserpina 580 had half oh <\s>
<s> why not all the debt forgiven which dear adonis had been doomed to pay to any witch who would have taught you it <\s>
<s> the heliad doth not know its value yet <\s>
<s> tis said in after times her spirit free 585 knew what love was and felt itself alone but holy dian could not chaster be before she stooped to kiss endymion than now this lady like a sexless bee tasting all blossoms and confined to none 590 among those mortal forms the wizard maiden passed with an eye serene and heart unladen <\s>
<s> to those she saw most beautiful she gave strange panacea in a crystal bowl they drank in their deep sleep of that sweet wave 595 and lived thenceforward as if some control mightier than life were in them and the grave of such when death oppressed the weary soul was as a green and overarching bower lit by the gems of many a starry flower <\s>

<s> and ever down the prone vale like a cloud upon a stream of wind the pinnace went 370 now lingering on the pools in which abode the calm and darkness of the deep content in which they paused now o'er the shallow road of white and dancing waters all besprent with sand and polished pebbles mortal boat 375 in such a shallow rapid could not float <\s>

<s> on which that lady played her many pranks circling the image of a shooting star 450 even as a tiger on hydaspes banks outspeeds the antelopes which speediest are in her light boat and many quips and cranks she played upon the water till the car of the late moon like a sick matron wan 455 to journey from the misty east began <\s>
<s> and then she called out of the hollow turrets of those high clouds white golden and vermilion the armies of her ministering spirits in mighty legions million after million 460 they came each troop emblazoning its merits on meteor flags and many a proud pavilion of the intertexture of the atmosphere they pitched upon the plain of the calm mere <\s>

<s> these were tame pleasures she would often climb the steepest ladder of the crudded rack up to some beaked cape of cloud sublime and like arion on the dolphin's back ride singing through the shoreless air oft time 485 following the serpent lightning's winding track she ran upon the platforms of the wind and laughed to bear the fire balls roar behind <\s>
<s> and sometimes to those streams of upper air which whirl the earth in its diurnal round 490 she would ascend and win the spirits there to let her join their chorus <\s>

<s> and ever down the prone vale like a cloud upon a stream of wind the pinnace went 370 now lingering on the pools in which abode the calm and darkness of the deep content in which they paused now o'er the shallow road of white and dancing waters all besprent with sand and polished pebbles mortal boat 375 in such a shallow rapid could not float <\s>

<s> or when the weary moon was in the wane or in the noon of interlunar night the lady witch in visions could not chain her spirit but sailed forth under the light 420 of shooting stars and bade extend amain its storm outspeeding wings the hermaphrodite she to the austral waters took her way beyond the fabulous thamondocana 48 <\s>
<s> where like a meadow which no scythe has shaven 425 which rain could never bend or whirl blast shake with the antarctic constellations paven canopus and his crew lay the austral lake there she would build herself a windless haven out of the clouds whose moving turrets make 430 the bastions of the storm when through the sky the spirits of the tempest thundered by 49 <\s>
<s> a haven beneath whose translucent floor the tremulous stars sparkled unfathomably and around which the solid vapours hoar 435 based on the level waters to the sky lifted their dreadful crags and like a shore of wintry mountains inaccessibly hemmed in with rifts and precipices gray and hanging crags many a cove and bay <\s>
<s> and whilst the outer lake beneath the lash of the wind's scourge foamed like a wounded thing and the incessant hail with stony clash ploughed up the waters and the flagging wing of the roused cormorant in the lightning flash 445 looked like the wreck of some wind wandering fragment of inky thunder smoke this haven was as a gem to copy heaven engraven 51 <\s>
<s> on which that lady played her many pranks circling the image of a shooting star 450 even as a tiger on hydaspes banks outspeeds the antelopes which speediest are in her light boat and many quips and cranks she played upon the water till the car of the late moon like a sick matron wan 455 to journey from the misty east began <\s>
<s> and then she called out of the hollow turrets of those high clouds white golden and vermilion the armies of her ministering spirits in mighty legions million after million 460 they came each troop emblazoning its merits on meteor flags and many a proud pavilion of the intertexture of the atmosphere they pitched upon the plain of the calm mere <\s>
<s> they framed the imperial tent of their great queen 465 of woven exhalations underlaid with lambent lightning fire as may be seen a dome of thin and open ivory inlaid with crimson silk cressets from the serene hung there and on the water for her tread 470 a tapestry of fleece like mist was strewn dyed in the beams of the ascending moon <\s>
<s> and on a throne o'erlaid with starlight caught upon those wandering isles of aery dew which highest shoals of mountain shipwreck not 475 she sate and heard all that had happened new between the earth and moon since they had brought the last intelligence and now she grew pale as that moon lost in the watery night and now she wept and now she laughed outright <\s>
<s> these were tame pleasures she would often climb the steepest ladder of the crudded rack up to some beaked cape of cloud sublime and like arion on the dolphin's back ride singing through the shoreless air oft time 485 following the serpent lightning's winding track she ran upon the platforms of the wind and laughed to bear the fire balls roar behind <\s>
<s> and sometimes to those streams of upper air which whirl the earth in its diurnal round 490 she would ascend and win the spirits there to let her join their chorus <\s>
<s> mortals found that on those days the sky was calm and fair and mystic snatches of harmonious sound wandered upon the earth where'er she passed 495 and happy thoughts of hope too sweet to last <\s>
<s> but her choice sport was in the hours of sleep to glide adown old nilus where he threads egypt and aethiopia from the steep of utmost axume until he spreads 500 like a calm flock of silver fleeced sheep his waters on the plain and crested heads of cities and proud temples gleam amid and many a vapour belted pyramid <\s>
<s> by moeris and the mareotid lakes 505 strewn with faint blooms like bridal chamber floors where naked boys bridling tame water snakes or charioteering ghastly alligators had left on the sweet waters mighty wakes of those huge forms within the brazen doors 510 of the great labyrinth slept both boy and beast tired with the pomp of their osirian feast <\s>
<s> and where within the surface of the river the shadows of the massy temples lie and never are erased but tremble ever 515 like things which every cloud can doom to die through lotus paven canals and wheresoever the works of man pierced that serenest sky with tombs and towers and fanes twas her delight to wander in the shadow of the night <\s>
<s> with motion like the spirit of that wind whose soft step deepens slumber her light feet passed through the peopled haunts of humankind <\s>
<s> scattering sweet visions from her presence sweet through fane and palace court and labyrinth mined 525 with many a dark and subterranean street under the nile through chambers high and deep she passed observing mortals in their sleep <\s>

<s> and little did the sight disturb her soul 545 we the weak mariners of that wide lake where'er its shores extend or billows roll our course unpiloted and starless make o'er its wild surface to an unknown goal but she in the calm depths her way could take 550 where in bright bowers immortal forms abide beneath the weltering of the restless tide <\s>
<s> and she saw princes couched under the glow of sunlike gems and round each temple court in dormitories ranged row after row 555 she saw the priests asleep all of one sort for all were educated to be so the peasants in their huts and in the port the sailors she saw cradled on the waves and the dead lulled within their dreamless graves <\s>

<s> on which that lady played her many pranks circling the image of a shooting star 450 even as a tiger on hydaspes banks outspeeds the antelopes which speediest are in her light boat and many quips and cranks she played upon the water till the car of the late moon like a sick matron wan 455 to journey from the misty east began <\s>
<s> and then she called out of the hollow turrets of those high clouds white golden and vermilion the armies of her ministering spirits in mighty legions million after million 460 they came each troop emblazoning its merits on meteor flags and many a proud pavilion of the intertexture of the atmosphere they pitched upon the plain of the calm mere <\s>

<s> and on a throne o'erlaid with starlight caught upon those wandering isles of aery dew which highest shoals of mountain shipwreck not 475 she sate and heard all that had happened new between the earth and moon since they had brought the last intelligence and now she grew pale as that moon lost in the watery night and now she wept and now she laughed outright <\s>
<s> these were tame pleasures she would often climb the steepest ladder of the crudded rack up to some beaked cape of cloud sublime and like arion on the dolphin's back ride singing through the shoreless air oft time 485 following the serpent lightning's winding track she ran upon the platforms of the wind and laughed to bear the fire balls roar behind <\s>
<s> and sometimes to those streams of upper air which whirl the earth in its diurnal round 490 she would ascend and win the spirits there to let her join their chorus <\s>
<s> mortals found that on those days the sky was calm and fair and mystic snatches of harmonious sound wandered upon the earth where'er she passed 495 and happy thoughts of hope too sweet to last <\s>

<s> by moeris and the mareotid lakes 505 strewn with faint blooms like bridal chamber floors where naked boys bridling tame water snakes or charioteering ghastly alligators had left on the sweet waters mighty wakes of those huge forms within the brazen doors 510 of the great labyrinth slept both boy and beast tired with the pomp of their osirian feast <\s>
<s> and where within the surface of the river the shadows of the massy temples lie and never are erased but tremble ever 515 like things which every cloud can doom to die through lotus paven canals and wheresoever the works of man pierced that serenest sky with tombs and towers and fanes twas her delight to wander in the shadow of the night <\s>

<s> and little did the sight disturb her soul 545 we the weak mariners of that wide lake where'er its shores extend or billows roll our course unpiloted and starless make o'er its wild surface to an unknown goal but she in the calm depths her way could take 550 where in bright bowers immortal forms abide beneath the weltering of the restless tide <\s>
<s> and she saw princes couched under the glow of sunlike gems and round each temple court in dormitories ranged row after row 555 she saw the priests asleep all of one sort for all were educated to be so the peasants in their huts and in the port the sailors she saw cradled on the waves and the dead lulled within their dreamless graves <\s>

<s> and ever down the prone vale like a cloud upon a stream of wind the pinnace went 370 now lingering on the pools in which abode the calm and darkness of the deep content in which they paused now o'er the shallow road of white and dancing waters all besprent with sand and polished pebbles mortal boat 375 in such a shallow rapid could not float <\s>

<s> or when the weary moon was in the wane or in the noon of interlunar night the lady witch in visions could not chain her spirit but sailed forth under the light 420 of shooting stars and bade extend amain its storm outspeeding wings the hermaphrodite she to the austral waters took her way beyond the fabulous thamondocana 48 <\s>
<s> where like a meadow which no scythe has shaven 425 which rain could never bend or whirl blast shake with the antarctic constellations paven canopus and his crew lay the austral lake there she would build herself a windless haven out of the clouds whose moving turrets make 430 the bastions of the storm when through the sky the spirits of the tempest thundered by 49 <\s>
<s> a haven beneath whose translucent floor the tremulous stars sparkled unfathomably and around which the solid vapours hoar 435 based on the level waters to the sky lifted their dreadful crags and like a shore of wintry mountains inaccessibly hemmed in with rifts and precipices gray and hanging crags many a cove and bay <\s>
<s> and whilst the outer lake beneath the lash of the wind's scourge foamed like a wounded thing and the incessant hail with stony clash ploughed up the waters and the flagging wing of the roused cormorant in the lightning flash 445 looked like the wreck of some wind wandering fragment of inky thunder smoke this haven was as a gem to copy heaven engraven 51 <\s>
<s> on which that lady played her many pranks circling the image of a shooting star 450 even as a tiger on hydaspes banks outspeeds the antelopes which speediest are in her light boat and many quips and cranks she played upon the water till the car of the late moon like a sick matron wan 455 to journey from the misty east began <\s>
<s> and then she called out of the hollow turrets of those high clouds white golden and vermilion the armies of her ministering spirits in mighty legions million after million 460 they came each troop emblazoning its merits on meteor flags and many a proud pavilion of the intertexture of the atmosphere they pitched upon the plain of the calm mere <\s>
<s> they framed the imperial tent of their great queen 465 of woven exhalations underlaid with lambent lightning fire as may be seen a dome of thin and open ivory inlaid with crimson silk cressets from the serene hung there and on the water for her tread 470 a tapestry of fleece like mist was strewn dyed in the beams of the ascending moon <\s>
<s> and on a throne o'erlaid with starlight caught upon those wandering isles of aery dew which highest shoals of mountain shipwreck not 475 she sate and heard all that had happened new between the earth and moon since they had brought the last intelligence and now she grew pale as that moon lost in the watery night and now she wept and now she laughed outright <\s>
<s> these were tame pleasures she would often climb the steepest ladder of the crudded rack up to some beaked cape of cloud sublime and like arion on the dolphin's back ride singing through the shoreless air oft time 485 following the serpent lightning's winding track she ran upon the platforms of the wind and laughed to bear the fire balls roar behind <\s>
<s> and sometimes to those streams of upper air which whirl the earth in its diurnal round 490 she would ascend and win the spirits there to let her join their chorus <\s>
<s> mortals found that on those days the sky was calm and fair and mystic snatches of harmonious sound wandered upon the earth where'er she passed 495 and happy thoughts of hope too sweet to last <\s>

<s> and ever down the prone vale like a cloud upon a stream of wind the pinnace went 370 now lingering on the pools in which abode the calm and darkness of the deep content in which they paused now o'er the shallow road of white and dancing waters all besprent with sand and polished pebbles mortal boat 375 in such a shallow rapid could not float <\s>

<s> or when the weary moon was in the wane or in the noon of interlunar night the lady witch in visions could not chain her spirit but sailed forth under the light 420 of shooting stars and bade extend amain its storm outspeeding wings the hermaphrodite she to the austral waters took her way beyond the fabulous thamondocana 48 <\s>
<s> where like a meadow which no scythe has shaven 425 which rain could never bend or whirl blast shake with the antarctic constellations paven canopus and his crew lay the austral lake there she would build herself a windless haven out of the clouds whose moving turrets make 430 the bastions of the storm when through the sky the spirits of the tempest thundered by 49 <\s>
<s> a haven beneath whose translucent floor the tremulous stars sparkled unfathomably and around which the solid vapours hoar 435 based on the level waters to the sky lifted their dreadful crags and like a shore of wintry mountains inaccessibly hemmed in with rifts and precipices gray and hanging crags many a cove and bay <\s>
<s> and whilst the outer lake beneath the lash of the wind's scourge foamed like a wounded thing and the incessant hail with stony clash ploughed up the waters and the flagging wing of the roused cormorant in the lightning flash 445 looked like the wreck of some wind wandering fragment of inky thunder smoke this haven was as a gem to copy heaven engraven 51 <\s>
<s> on which that lady played her many pranks circling the image of a shooting star 450 even as a tiger on hydaspes banks outspeeds the antelopes which speediest are in her light boat and many quips and cranks she played upon the water till the car of the late moon like a sick matron wan 455 to journey from the misty east began <\s>
<s> and then she called out of the hollow turrets of those high clouds white golden and vermilion the armies of her ministering spirits in mighty legions million after million 460 they came each troop emblazoning its merits on meteor flags and many a proud pavilion of the intertexture of the atmosphere they pitched upon the plain of the calm mere <\s>
<s> they framed the imperial tent of their great queen 465 of woven exhalations underlaid with lambent lightning fire as may be seen a dome of thin and open ivory inlaid with crimson silk cressets from the serene hung there and on the water for her tread 470 a tapestry of fleece like mist was strewn dyed in the beams of the ascending moon <\s>
<s> and on a throne o'erlaid with starlight caught upon those wandering isles of aery dew which highest shoals of mountain shipwreck not 475 she sate and heard all that had happened new between the earth and moon since they had brought the last intelligence and now she grew pale as that moon lost in the watery night and now she wept and now she laughed outright <\s>
<s> these were tame pleasures she would often climb the steepest ladder of the crudded rack up to some beaked cape of cloud sublime and like arion on the dolphin's back ride singing through the shoreless air oft time 485 following the serpent lightning's winding track she ran upon the platforms of the wind and laughed to bear the fire balls roar behind <\s>
<s> and sometimes to those streams of upper air which whirl the earth in its diurnal round 490 she would ascend and win the spirits there to let her join their chorus <\s>
<s> mortals found that on those days the sky was calm and fair and mystic snatches of harmonious sound wandered upon the earth where'er she passed 495 and happy thoughts of hope too sweet to last <\s>
<s> but her choice sport was in the hours of sleep to glide adown old nilus where he threads egypt and aethiopia from the steep of utmost axume until he spreads 500 like a calm flock of silver fleeced sheep his waters on the plain and crested heads of cities and proud temples gleam amid and many a vapour belted pyramid <\s>
<s> by moeris and the mareotid lakes 505 strewn with faint blooms like bridal chamber floors where naked boys bridling tame water snakes or charioteering ghastly alligators had left on the sweet waters mighty wakes of those huge forms within the brazen doors 510 of the great labyrinth slept both boy and beast tired with the pomp of their osirian feast <\s>
<s> and where within the surface of the river the shadows of the massy temples lie and never are erased but tremble ever 515 like things which every cloud can doom to die through lotus paven canals and wheresoever the works of man pierced that serenest sky with tombs and towers and fanes twas her delight to wander in the shadow of the night <\s>
<s> with motion like the spirit of that wind whose soft step deepens slumber her light feet passed through the peopled haunts of humankind <\s>
<s> scattering sweet visions from her presence sweet through fane and palace court and labyrinth mined 525 with many a dark and subterranean street under the nile through chambers high and deep she passed observing mortals in their sleep <\s>

<s> and little did the sight disturb her soul 545 we the weak mariners of that wide lake where'er its shores extend or billows roll our course unpiloted and starless make o'er its wild surface to an unknown goal but she in the calm depths her way could take 550 where in bright bowers immortal forms abide beneath the weltering of the restless tide <\s>
<s> and she saw princes couched under the glow of sunlike gems and round each temple court in dormitories ranged row after row 555 she saw the priests asleep all of one sort for all were educated to be so the peasants in their huts and in the port the sailors she saw cradled on the waves and the dead lulled within their dreamless graves <\s>

<s> on which that lady played her many pranks circling the image of a shooting star 450 even as a tiger on hydaspes banks outspeeds the antelopes which speediest are in her light boat and many quips and cranks she played upon the water till the car of the late moon like a sick matron wan 455 to journey from the misty east began <\s>
<s> and then she called out of the hollow turrets of those high clouds white golden and vermilion the armies of her ministering spirits in mighty legions million after million 460 they came each troop emblazoning its merits on meteor flags and many a proud pavilion of the intertexture of the atmosphere they pitched upon the plain of the calm mere <\s>

<s> and on a throne o'erlaid with starlight caught upon those wandering isles of aery dew which highest shoals of mountain shipwreck not 475 she sate and heard all that had happened new between the earth and moon since they had brought the last intelligence and now she grew pale as that moon lost in the watery night and now she wept and now she laughed outright <\s>
<s> these were tame pleasures she would often climb the steepest ladder of the crudded rack up to some beaked cape of cloud sublime and like arion on the dolphin's back ride singing through the shoreless air oft time 485 following the serpent lightning's winding track she ran upon the platforms of the wind and laughed to bear the fire balls roar behind <\s>
<s> and sometimes to those streams of upper air which whirl the earth in its diurnal round 490 she would ascend and win the spirits there to let her join their chorus <\s>
<s> mortals found that on those days the sky was calm and fair and mystic snatches of harmonious sound wandered upon the earth where'er she passed 495 and happy thoughts of hope too sweet to last <\s>

<s> by moeris and the mareotid lakes 505 strewn with faint blooms like bridal chamber floors where naked boys bridling tame water snakes or charioteering ghastly alligators had left on the sweet waters mighty wakes of those huge forms within the brazen doors 510 of the great labyrinth slept both boy and beast tired with the pomp of their osirian feast <\s>
<s> and where within the surface of the river the shadows of the massy temples lie and never are erased but tremble ever 515 like things which every cloud can doom to die through lotus paven canals and wheresoever the works of man pierced that serenest sky with tombs and towers and fanes twas her delight to wander in the shadow of the night <\s>

<s> and little did the sight disturb her soul 545 we the weak mariners of that wide lake where'er its shores extend or billows roll our course unpiloted and starless make o'er its wild surface to an unknown goal but she in the calm depths her way could take 550 where in bright bowers immortal forms abide beneath the weltering of the restless tide <\s>
<s> and she saw princes couched under the glow of sunlike gems and round each temple court in dormitories ranged row after row 555 she saw the priests asleep all of one sort for all were educated to be so the peasants in their huts and in the port the sailors she saw cradled on the waves and the dead lulled within their dreamless graves <\s>

<s> and ever down the prone vale like a cloud upon a stream of wind the pinnace went 370 now lingering on the pools in which abode the calm and darkness of the deep content in which they paused now o'er the shallow road of white and dancing waters all besprent with sand and polished pebbles mortal boat 375 in such a shallow rapid could not float <\s>

<s> or when the weary moon was in the wane or in the noon of interlunar night the lady witch in visions could not chain her spirit but sailed forth under the light 420 of shooting stars and bade extend amain its storm outspeeding wings the hermaphrodite she to the austral waters took her way beyond the fabulous thamondocana 48 <\s>
<s> where like a meadow which no scythe has shaven 425 which rain could never bend or whirl blast shake with the antarctic constellations paven canopus and his crew lay the austral lake there she would build herself a windless haven out of the clouds whose moving turrets make 430 the bastions of the storm when through the sky the spirits of the tempest thundered by 49 <\s>
<s> a haven beneath whose translucent floor the tremulous stars sparkled unfathomably and around which the solid vapours hoar 435 based on the level waters to the sky lifted their dreadful crags and like a shore of wintry mountains inaccessibly hemmed in with rifts and precipices gray and hanging crags many a cove and bay <\s>
<s> and whilst the outer lake beneath the lash of the wind's scourge foamed like a wounded thing and the incessant hail with stony clash ploughed up the waters and the flagging wing of the roused cormorant in the lightning flash 445 looked like the wreck of some wind wandering fragment of inky thunder smoke this haven was as a gem to copy heaven engraven 51 <\s>
<s> on which that lady played her many pranks circling the image of a shooting star 450 even as a tiger on hydaspes banks outspeeds the antelopes which speediest are in her light boat and many quips and cranks she played upon the water till the car of the late moon like a sick matron wan 455 to journey from the misty east began <\s>
<s> and then she called out of the hollow turrets of those high clouds white golden and vermilion the armies of her ministering spirits in mighty legions million after million 460 they came each troop emblazoning its merits on meteor flags and many a proud pavilion of the intertexture of the atmosphere they pitched upon the plain of the calm mere <\s>
<s> they framed the imperial tent of their great queen 465 of woven exhalations underlaid with lambent lightning fire as may be seen a dome of thin and open ivory inlaid with crimson silk cressets from the serene hung there and on the water for her tread 470 a tapestry of fleece like mist was strewn dyed in the beams of the ascending moon <\s>
<s> and on a throne o'erlaid with starlight caught upon those wandering isles of aery dew which highest shoals of mountain shipwreck not 475 she sate and heard all that had happened new between the earth and moon since they had brought the last intelligence and now she grew pale as that moon lost in the watery night and now she wept and now she laughed outright <\s>
<s> these were tame pleasures she would often climb the steepest ladder of the crudded rack up to some beaked cape of cloud sublime and like arion on the dolphin's back ride singing through the shoreless air oft time 485 following the serpent lightning's winding track she ran upon the platforms of the wind and laughed to bear the fire balls roar behind <\s>
<s> and sometimes to those streams of upper air which whirl the earth in its diurnal round 490 she would ascend and win the spirits there to let her join their chorus <\s>
<s> mortals found that on those days the sky was calm and fair and mystic snatches of harmonious sound wandered upon the earth where'er she passed 495 and happy thoughts of hope too sweet to last <\s>

<s> and ever down the prone vale like a cloud upon a stream of wind the pinnace went 370 now lingering on the pools in which abode the calm and darkness of the deep content in which they paused now o'er the shallow road of white and dancing waters all besprent with sand and polished pebbles mortal boat 375 in such a shallow rapid could not float <\s>

<s> or when the weary moon was in the wane or in the noon of interlunar night the lady witch in visions could not chain her spirit but sailed forth under the light 420 of shooting stars and bade extend amain its storm outspeeding wings the hermaphrodite she to the austral waters took her way beyond the fabulous thamondocana 48 <\s>
<s> where like a meadow which no scythe has shaven 425 which rain could never bend or whirl blast shake with the antarctic constellations paven canopus and his crew lay the austral lake there she would build herself a windless haven out of the clouds whose moving turrets make 430 the bastions of the storm when through the sky the spirits of the tempest thundered by 49 <\s>
<s> a haven beneath whose translucent floor the tremulous stars sparkled unfathomably and around which the solid vapours hoar 435 based on the level waters to the sky lifted their dreadful crags and like a shore of wintry mountains inaccessibly hemmed in with rifts and precipices gray and hanging crags many a cove and bay <\s>
<s> and whilst the outer lake beneath the lash of the wind's scourge foamed like a wounded thing and the incessant hail with stony clash ploughed up the waters and the flagging wing of the roused cormorant in the lightning flash 445 looked like the wreck of some wind wandering fragment of inky thunder smoke this haven was as a gem to copy heaven engraven 51 <\s>
<s> on which that lady played her many pranks circling the image of a shooting star 450 even as a tiger on hydaspes banks outspeeds the antelopes which speediest are in her light boat and many quips and cranks she played upon the water till the car of the late moon like a sick matron wan 455 to journey from the misty east began <\s>
<s> and then she called out of the hollow turrets of those high clouds white golden and vermilion the armies of her ministering spirits in mighty legions million after million 460 they came each troop emblazoning its merits on meteor flags and many a proud pavilion of the intertexture of the atmosphere they pitched upon the plain of the calm mere <\s>
<s> they framed the imperial tent of their great queen 465 of woven exhalations underlaid with lambent lightning fire as may be seen a dome of thin and open ivory inlaid with crimson silk cressets from the serene hung there and on the water for her tread 470 a tapestry of fleece like mist was strewn dyed in the beams of the ascending moon <\s>
<s> and on a throne o'erlaid with starlight caught upon those wandering isles of aery dew which highest shoals of mountain shipwreck not 475 she sate and heard all that had happened new between the earth and moon since they had brought the last intelligence and now she grew pale as that moon lost in the watery night and now she wept and now she laughed outright <\s>
<s> these were tame pleasures she would often climb the steepest ladder of the crudded rack up to some beaked cape of cloud sublime and like arion on the dolphin's back ride singing through the shoreless air oft time 485 following the serpent lightning's winding track she ran upon the platforms of the wind and laughed to bear the fire balls roar behind <\s>
<s> and sometimes to those streams of upper air which whirl the earth in its diurnal round 490 she would ascend and win the spirits there to let her join their chorus <\s>
<s> mortals found that on those days the sky was calm and fair and mystic snatches of harmonious sound wandered upon the earth where'er she passed 495 and happy thoughts of hope too sweet to last <\s>
<s> but her choice sport was in the hours of sleep to glide adown old nilus where he threads egypt and aethiopia from the steep of utmost axume until he spreads 500 like a calm flock of silver fleeced sheep his waters on the plain and crested heads of cities and proud temples gleam amid and many a vapour belted pyramid <\s>
<s> by moeris and the mareotid lakes 505 strewn with faint blooms like bridal chamber floors where naked boys bridling tame water snakes or charioteering ghastly alligators had left on the sweet waters mighty wakes of those huge forms within the brazen doors 510 of the great labyrinth slept both boy and beast tired with the pomp of their osirian feast <\s>
<s> and where within the surface of the river the shadows of the massy temples lie and never are erased but tremble ever 515 like things which every cloud can doom to die through lotus paven canals and wheresoever the works of man pierced that serenest sky with tombs and towers and fanes twas her delight to wander in the shadow of the night <\s>
<s> with motion like the spirit of that wind whose soft step deepens slumber her light feet passed through the peopled haunts of humankind <\s>
<s> scattering sweet visions from her presence sweet through fane and palace court and labyrinth mined 525 with many a dark and subterranean street under the nile through chambers high and deep she passed observing mortals in their sleep <\s>

<s> and little did the sight disturb her soul 545 we the weak mariners of that wide lake where'er its shores extend or billows roll our course unpiloted and starless make o'er its wild surface to an unknown goal but she in the calm depths her way could take 550 where in bright bowers immortal forms abide beneath the weltering of the restless tide <\s>
<s> and she saw princes couched under the glow of sunlike gems and round each temple court in dormitories ranged row after row 555 she saw the priests asleep all of one sort for all were educated to be so the peasants in their huts and in the port the sailors she saw cradled on the waves and the dead lulled within their dreamless graves <\s>

<s> on which that lady played her many pranks circling the image of a shooting star 450 even as a tiger on hydaspes banks outspeeds the antelopes which speediest are in her light boat and many quips and cranks she played upon the water till the car of the late moon like a sick matron wan 455 to journey from the misty east began <\s>
<s> and then she called out of the hollow turrets of those high clouds white golden and vermilion the armies of her ministering spirits in mighty legions million after million 460 they came each troop emblazoning its merits on meteor flags and many a proud pavilion of the intertexture of the atmosphere they pitched upon the plain of the calm mere <\s>

<s> and on a throne o'erlaid with starlight caught upon those wandering isles of aery dew which highest shoals of mountain shipwreck not 475 she sate and heard all that had happened new between the earth and moon since they had brought the last intelligence and now she grew pale as that moon lost in the watery night and now she wept and now she laughed outright <\s>
<s> these were tame pleasures she would often climb the steepest ladder of the crudded rack up to some beaked cape of cloud sublime and like arion on the dolphin's back ride singing through the shoreless air oft time 485 following the serpent lightning's winding track she ran upon the platforms of the wind and laughed to bear the fire balls roar behind <\s>
<s> and sometimes to those streams of upper air which whirl the earth in its diurnal round 490 she would ascend and win the spirits there to let her join their chorus <\s>
<s> mortals found that on those days the sky was calm and fair and mystic snatches of harmonious sound wandered upon the earth where'er she passed 495 and happy thoughts of hope too sweet to last <\s>

<s> by moeris and the mareotid lakes 505 strewn with faint blooms like bridal chamber floors where naked boys bridling tame water snakes or charioteering ghastly alligators had left on the sweet waters mighty wakes of those huge forms within the brazen doors 510 of the great labyrinth slept both boy and beast tired with the pomp of their osirian feast <\s>
<s> and where within the surface of the river the shadows of the massy temples lie and never are erased but tremble ever 515 like things which every cloud can doom to die through lotus paven canals and wheresoever the works of man pierced that serenest sky with tombs and towers and fanes twas her delight to wander in the shadow of the night <\s>

<s> and little did the sight disturb her soul 545 we the weak mariners of that wide lake where'er its shores extend or billows roll our course unpiloted and starless make o'er its wild surface to an unknown goal but she in the calm depths her way could take 550 where in bright bowers immortal forms abide beneath the weltering of the restless tide <\s>
<s> and she saw princes couched under the glow of sunlike gems and round each temple court in dormitories ranged row after row 555 she saw the priests asleep all of one sort for all were educated to be so the peasants in their huts and in the port the sailors she saw cradled on the waves and the dead lulled within their dreamless graves <\s>

<s> but other troubled forms of sleep she saw not to be mirrored in a holy song distortions foul of supernatural awe and pale imaginings of visioned wrong 540 and all the code of custom's lawless law written upon the brows of old and young this said the wizard maiden is the strife which stirs the liquid surface of man's life <\s>
<s> and little did the sight disturb her soul 545 we the weak mariners of that wide lake where'er its shores extend or billows roll our course unpiloted and starless make o'er its wild surface to an unknown goal but she in the calm depths her way could take 550 where in bright bowers immortal forms abide beneath the weltering of the restless tide <\s>
<s> and she saw princes couched under the glow of sunlike gems and round each temple court in dormitories ranged row after row 555 she saw the priests asleep all of one sort for all were educated to be so the peasants in their huts and in the port the sailors she saw cradled on the waves and the dead lulled within their dreamless graves <\s>
<s> and all the forms in which those spirits lay were to her sight like the diaphanous veils in which those sweet ladies oft array their delicate limbs who would conceal from us only their scorn of all concealment they 565 move in the light of their own beauty thus <\s>
<s> but these and all now lay with sleep upon them and little thought a witch was looking on them <\s>
<s> she all those human figures breathing there beheld as living spirits to her eyes 570 the naked beauty of the soul lay bare and often through a rude and worn disguise she saw the inner form most bright and fair and then she had a charm of strange device which murmured on mute lips with tender tone 575 could make that spirit mingle with her own <\s>
<s> aurora what wouldst thou have given for such a charm when tithon became gray <\s>
<s> or how much venus of thy silver heaven wouldst thou have yielded ere proserpina 580 had half oh <\s>
<s> why not all the debt forgiven which dear adonis had been doomed to pay to any witch who would have taught you it <\s>
<s> the heliad doth not know its value yet <\s>
<s> tis said in after times her spirit free 585 knew what love was and felt itself alone but holy dian could not chaster be before she stooped to kiss endymion than now this lady like a sexless bee tasting all blossoms and confined to none 590 among those mortal forms the wizard maiden passed with an eye serene and heart unladen <\s>
<s> to those she saw most beautiful she gave strange panacea in a crystal bowl they drank in their deep sleep of that sweet wave 595 and lived thenceforward as if some control mightier than life were in them and the grave of such when death oppressed the weary soul was as a green and overarching bower lit by the gems of many a starry flower <\s>

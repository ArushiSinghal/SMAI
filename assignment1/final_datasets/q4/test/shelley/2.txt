<s> a very few years with their attendant events had checked the ardour of shelley's hopes though he still thought them well grounded and that to advance their fulfilment was the noblest task man could achieve <\s>
<s> this is neither the time nor place to speak of the misfortunes that chequered his life <\s>

<s> a very few years with their attendant events had checked the ardour of shelley's hopes though he still thought them well grounded and that to advance their fulfilment was the noblest task man could achieve <\s>
<s> this is neither the time nor place to speak of the misfortunes that chequered his life <\s>

<s> more dark 430 and dark the shades accumulate <\s>
<s> the oak expanding its immense and knotty arms embraces the light beech <\s>

<s> like restless serpents clothed in rainbow and in fire the parasites starred with ten thousand blossoms flow around 440 the grey trunks and as gamesome infants eyes with gentle meanings and most innocent wiles fold their beams round the hearts of those that love these twine their tendrils with the wedded boughs uniting their close union the woven leaves 445 make net work of the dark blue light of day and the night's noontide clearness mutable as shapes in the weird clouds <\s>

<s> through the dell silence and twilight here twin sisters keep 455 their noonday watch and sail among the shades like vaporous shapes half seen beyond a well dark gleaming and of most translucent wave images all the woven boughs above and each depending leaf and every speck 460 of azure sky darting between their chasms nor aught else in the liquid mirror laves its portraiture but some inconstant star between one foliaged lattice twinkling fair or painted bird sleeping beneath the moon 465 or gorgeous insect floating motionless unconscious of the day ere yet his wings have spread their glories to the gaze of noon <\s>
<s> hither the poet came <\s>
<s> his eyes beheld their own wan light through the reflected lines 470 of his thin hair distinct in the dark depth of that still fountain as the human heart gazing in dreams over the gloomy grave sees its own treacherous likeness there <\s>
<s> he heard the motion of the leaves the grass that sprung 475 startled and glanced and trembled even to feel an unaccustomed presence and the sound of the sweet brook that from the secret springs of that dark fountain rose <\s>
<s> a spirit seemed to stand beside him clothed in no bright robes 480 of shadowy silver or enshrining light borrowed from aught the visible world affords of grace or majesty or mystery but undulating woods and silent well and leaping rivulet and evening gloom 485 now deepening the dark shades for speech assuming held commune with him as if he and it were all that was only ... when his regard was raised by intense pensiveness ... two eyes two starry eyes hung in the gloom of thought 490 and seemed with their serene and azure smiles to beckon him <\s>
<s> obedient to the light that shone within his soul he went pursuing the windings of the dell the rivulet wanton and wild through many a green ravine 495 beneath the forest flowed <\s>
<s> sometimes it fell among the moss with hollow harmony dark and profound <\s>
<s> now on the polished stones it danced like childhood laughing as it went then through the plain in tranquil wanderings crept 500 reflecting every herb and drooping bud that overhung its quietness o stream <\s>
<s> whose source is inaccessibly profound whither do thy mysterious waters tend <\s>
<s> thou imagest my life <\s>
<s> thy darksome stillness 505 thy dazzling waves thy loud and hollow gulfs thy searchless fountain and invisible course have each their type in me and the wide sky <\s>
<s> and measureless ocean may declare as soon what oozy cavern or what wandering cloud 510 contains thy waters as the universe tell where these living thoughts reside when stretched upon thy flowers my bloodless limbs shall waste i the passing wind <\s>
<s> beside the grassy shore of the small stream he went he did impress 515 on the green moss his tremulous step that caught strong shuddering from his burning limbs <\s>
<s> as one roused by some joyous madness from the couch of fever he did move yet not like him forgetful of the grave where when the flame 520 of his frail exultation shall be spent he must descend <\s>
<s> with rapid steps he went beneath the shade of trees beside the flow of the wild babbling rivulet and now the forest's solemn canopies were changed 525 for the uniform and lightsome evening sky <\s>
<s> grey rocks did peep from the spare moss and stemmed the struggling brook tall spires of windlestrae threw their thin shadows down the rugged slope and nought but gnarled roots of ancient pines 530 branchless and blasted clenched with grasping roots the unwilling soil <\s>
<s> a gradual change was here yet ghastly <\s>
<s> for as fast years flow away the smooth brow gathers and the hair grows thin and white and where irradiate dewy eyes 535 had shone gleam stony orbs so from his steps bright flowers departed and the beautiful shade of the green groves with all their odorous winds and musical motions <\s>
<s> calm he still pursued the stream that with a larger volume now 540 rolled through the labyrinthine dell and there fretted a path through its descending curves with its wintry speed <\s>
<s> on every side now rose rocks which in unimaginable forms lifted their black and barren pinnacles 545 in the light of evening and its precipice obscuring the ravine disclosed above mid toppling stones black gulfs and yawning caves whose windings gave ten thousand various tongues to the loud stream <\s>
<s> where the pass expands 550 its stony jaws the abrupt mountain breaks and seems with its accumulated crags to overhang the world for wide expand beneath the wan stars and descending moon islanded seas blue mountains mighty streams 555 dim tracts and vast robed in the lustrous gloom of leaden coloured even and fiery hills mingling their flames with twilight on the verge of the remote horizon <\s>
<s> the near scene in naked and severe simplicity 560 made contrast with the universe <\s>
<s> a pine rock rooted stretched athwart the vacancy its swinging boughs to each inconstant blast yielding one only response at each pause in most familiar cadence with the howl 565 the thunder and the hiss of homeless streams mingling its solemn song whilst the broad river foaming and hurrying o'er its rugged path fell into that immeasurable void scattering its waters to the passing winds <\s>
<s> 570 yet the grey precipice and solemn pine and torrent were not all one silent nook was there <\s>
<s> even on the edge of that vast mountain upheld by knotty roots and fallen rocks it overlooked in its serenity 575 the dark earth and the bending vault of stars <\s>
<s> it was a tranquil spot that seemed to smile even in the lap of horror <\s>
<s> ivy clasped the fissured stones with its entwining arms and did embower with leaves for ever green 580 and berries dark the smooth and even space of its inviolated floor and here the children of the autumnal whirlwind bore in wanton sport those bright leaves whose decay red yellow or ethereally pale 585 rivals the pride of summer <\s>
<s> tis the haunt of every gentle wind whose breath can teach the wilds to love tranquillity <\s>
<s> one step one human step alone has ever broken the stillness of its solitude one voice 590 alone inspired its echoes even that voice which hither came floating among the winds and led the loveliest among human forms to make their wild haunts the depository of all the grace and beauty that endued 595 its motions render up its majesty scatter its music on the unfeeling storm and to the damp leaves and blue cavern mould nurses of rainbow flowers and branching moss commit the colours of that varying cheek 600 that snowy breast those dark and drooping eyes <\s>
<s> the dim and horned moon hung low and poured a sea of lustre on the horizon's verge that overflowed its mountains <\s>
<s> yellow mist filled the unbounded atmosphere and drank 605 wan moonlight even to fulness not a star shone not a sound was heard the very winds danger's grim playmates on that precipice slept clasped in his embrace o storm of death <\s>
<s> whose sightless speed divides this sullen night 610 and thou colossal skeleton that still guiding its irresistible career in thy devastating omnipotence art king of this frail world from the red field of slaughter from the reeking hospital 615 the patriot's sacred couch the snowy bed of innocence the scaffold and the throne a mighty voice invokes thee <\s>
<s> ruin calls his brother death <\s>
<s> a rare and regal prey he hath prepared prowling around the world 620 glutted with which thou mayst repose and men go to their graves like flowers or creeping worms nor ever more offer at thy dark shrine the unheeded tribute of a broken heart <\s>
<s> when on the threshold of the green recess 625 the wanderer's footsteps fell he knew that death was on him <\s>
<s> yet a little ere it fled did he resign his high and holy soul to images of the majestic past that paused within his passive being now 630 like winds that bear sweet music when they breathe through some dim latticed chamber <\s>
<s> he did place his pale lean hand upon the rugged trunk of the old pine <\s>
<s> upon an ivied stone reclined his languid head his limbs did rest 635 diffused and motionless on the smooth brink of that obscurest chasm and thus he lay surrendering to their final impulses the hovering powers of life <\s>
<s> hope and despair the torturers slept no mortal pain or fear 640 marred his repose the influxes of sense and his own being unalloyed by pain yet feebler and more feeble calmly fed the stream of thought till he lay breathing there at peace and faintly smiling his last sight 645 was the great moon which o'er the western line of the wide world her mighty horn suspended with whose dun beams inwoven darkness seemed to mingle <\s>
<s> now upon the jagged hills it rests and still as the divided frame 650 of the vast meteor sunk the poet's blood that ever beat in mystic sympathy with nature's ebb and flow grew feebler still and when two lessening points of light alone gleamed through the darkness the alternate gasp 655 of his faint respiration scarce did stir the stagnate night till the minutest ray was quenched the pulse yet lingered in his heart <\s>
<s> but when heaven remained utterly black the murky shades involved 660 an image silent cold and motionless as their own voiceless earth and vacant air <\s>
<s> even as a vapour fed with golden beams that ministered on sunlight ere the west eclipses it was now that wondrous frame 665 no sense no motion no divinity a fragile lute on whose harmonious strings the breath of heaven did wander a bright stream once fed with many voiced waves a dream of youth which night and time have quenched for ever 670 still dark and dry and unremembered now <\s>
<s> oh for medea's wondrous alchemy which wheresoe'er it fell made the earth gleam with bright flowers and the wintry boughs exhale from vernal blooms fresh fragrance <\s>
<s> o that god 675 profuse of poisons would concede the chalice which but one living man has drained who now vessel of deathless wrath a slave that feels no proud exemption in the blighting curse he bears over the world wanders for ever 680 lone as incarnate death <\s>
<s> o that the dream of dark magician in his visioned cave raking the cinders of a crucible for life and power even when his feeble hand shakes in its last decay were the true law 685 of this so lovely world <\s>
<s> but thou art fled like some frail exhalation which the dawn robes in its golden beams ah <\s>
<s> the brave the gentle and the beautiful the child of grace and genius <\s>
<s> heartless things 690 are done and said i the world and many worms and beasts and men live on and mighty earth from sea and mountain city and wilderness in vesper low or joyous orison lifts still its solemn voice but thou art fled 695 thou canst no longer know or love the shapes of this phantasmal scene who have to thee been purest ministers who are alas <\s>
<s> now thou art not <\s>

<s> note on alastor by mrs <\s>
<s> alastor is written in a very different tone from queen mab <\s>
<s> in the latter shelley poured out all the cherished speculations of his youth all the irrepressible emotions of sympathy censure and hope to which the present suffering and what he considers the proper destiny of his fellow creatures gave birth <\s>
<s> alastor on the contrary contains an individual interest only <\s>
<s> a very few years with their attendant events had checked the ardour of shelley's hopes though he still thought them well grounded and that to advance their fulfilment was the noblest task man could achieve <\s>
<s> this is neither the time nor place to speak of the misfortunes that chequered his life <\s>
<s> it will be sufficient to say that in all he did he at the time of doing it believed himself justified to his own conscience while the various ills of poverty and loss of friends brought home to him the sad realities of life <\s>
<s> physical suffering had also considerable influence in causing him to turn his eyes inward inclining him rather to brood over the thoughts and emotions of his own soul than to glance abroad and to make as in queen mab the whole universe the object and subject of his song <\s>
<s> in the spring of 1815 an eminent physician pronounced that he was dying rapidly of a consumption abscesses were formed on his lungs and he suffered acute spasms <\s>
<s> suddenly a complete change took place and though through life he was a martyr to pain and debility every symptom of pulmonary disease vanished <\s>
<s> his nerves which nature had formed sensitive to an unexampled degree were rendered still more susceptible by the state of his health <\s>
<s> as soon as the peace of 1814 had opened the continent he went abroad <\s>
<s> he visited some of the more magnificent scenes of switzerland and returned to england from lucerne by the reuss and the rhine <\s>

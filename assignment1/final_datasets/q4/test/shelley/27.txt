<s> on the beach of a northern sea 45 which tempests shake eternally as once the wretch there lay to sleep lies a solitary heap one white skull and seven dry bones on the margin of the stones 50 where a few gray rushes stand boundaries of the sea and land nor is heard one voice of wail but the sea mews as they sail o'er the billows of the gale 55 or the whirlwind up and down howling like a slaughtered town when a king in glory rides through the pomp of fratricides those unburied bones around 60 there is many a mournful sound there is no lament for him like a sunless vapour dim who once clothed with life and thought what now moves nor murmurs not <\s>

<s> by the skirts of that gray cloud many domed padua proud 215 stands a peopled solitude mid the harvest shining plain where the peasant heaps his grain in the garner of his foe and the milk white oxen slow 220 with the purple vintage strain heaped upon the creaking wain that the brutal celt may swill drunken sleep with savage will and the sickle to the sword 225 lies unchanged though many a lord like a weed whose shade is poison overgrows this region's foison sheaves of whom are ripe to come to destruction's harvest home 230 men must reap the things they sow force from force must ever flow or worse but tis a bitter woe that love or reason cannot change the despot's rage the slave's revenge <\s>

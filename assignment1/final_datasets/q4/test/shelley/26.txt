<s> a pale dream came to a lady fair and said a boon a boon i pray <\s>
<s> i know the secrets of the air and things are lost in the glare of day which i can make the sleeping see 5 if they will put their trust in me <\s>
<s> and thou shalt know of things unknown if thou wilt let me rest between the veiny lids whose fringe is thrown over thine eyes so dark and sheen 10 and half in hope and half in fright the lady closed her eyes so bright <\s>
<s> at first all deadly shapes were driven tumultuously across her sleep and o'er the vast cope of bending heaven 15 all ghastly visaged clouds did sweep and the lady ever looked to spy if the golden sun shone forth on high <\s>
<s> and as towards the east she turned she saw aloft in the morning air 20 which now with hues of sunrise burned a great black anchor rising there and wherever the lady turned her eyes it hung before her in the skies <\s>
<s> the sky was blue as the summer sea 25 the depths were cloudless overhead the air was calm as it could be there was no sight or sound of dread but that black anchor floating still over the piny eastern hill <\s>
<s> the lady grew sick with a weight of fear to see that anchor ever hanging and veiled her eyes she then did hear the sound as of a dim low clanging and looked abroad if she might know 35 was it aught else or but the flow of the blood in her own veins to and fro <\s>
<s> there was a mist in the sunless air which shook as it were with an earthquake's shock but the very weeds that blossomed there 40 were moveless and each mighty rock stood on its basis steadfastly the anchor was seen no more on high <\s>
<s> but piled around with summits hid in lines of cloud at intervals 45 stood many a mountain pyramid among whose everlasting walls two mighty cities shone and ever through the red mist their domes did quiver <\s>
<s> on two dread mountains from whose crest 50 might seem the eagle for her brood would ne'er have hung her dizzy nest those tower encircled cities stood <\s>
<s> a vision strange such towers to see sculptured and wrought so gorgeously 55 where human art could never be <\s>
<s> and columns framed of marble white and giant fanes dome over dome piled and triumphant gates all bright with workmanship which could not come 60 from touch of mortal instrument shot o'er the vales or lustre lent from its own shapes magnificent <\s>
<s> but still the lady heard that clang filling the wide air far away 65 and still the mist whose light did hang among the mountains shook alway so that the lady's heart beat fast as half in joy and half aghast on those high domes her look she cast <\s>
<s> sudden from out that city sprung a light that made the earth grow red two flames that each with quivering tongue licked its high domes and overhead among those mighty towers and fanes 75 dropped fire as a volcano rains its sulphurous ruin on the plains <\s>
<s> a rush as if the deep had burst its bonds she looked behind and saw over the western steep 80 a raging flood descend and wind through that wide vale she felt no fear but said within herself tis clear these towers are nature's own and she to save them has sent forth the sea <\s>
<s> and now those raging billows came where that fair lady sate and she was borne towards the showering flame by the wild waves heaped tumultuously <\s>
<s> and on a little plank the flow 90 of the whirlpool bore her to and fro <\s>
<s> the flames were fiercely vomited from every tower and every dome and dreary light did widely shed o'er that vast flood's suspended foam 95 beneath the smoke which hung its night on the stained cope of heaven's light <\s>
<s> the plank whereon that lady sate was driven through the chasms about and about between the peaks so desolate 100 of the drowning mountains in and out as the thistle beard on a whirlwind sails while the flood was filling those hollow vales <\s>
<s> at last her plank an eddy crossed and bore her to the city's wall 105 which now the flood had reached almost it might the stoutest heart appal to hear the fire roar and hiss through the domes of those mighty palaces <\s>
<s> the eddy whirled her round and round 110 before a gorgeous gate which stood piercing the clouds of smoke which bound its aery arch with light like blood she looked on that gate of marble clear with wonder that extinguished fear <\s>
<s> for it was filled with sculptures rarest of forms most beautiful and strange like nothing human but the fairest of winged shapes whose legions range throughout the sleep of those that are 120 like this same lady good and fair <\s>
<s> and as she looked still lovelier grew those marble forms the sculptor sure was a strong spirit and the hue of his own mind did there endure 125 after the touch whose power had braided such grace was in some sad change faded <\s>
<s> she looked the flames were dim the flood grew tranquil as a woodland river winding through hills in solitude 130 those marble shapes then seemed to quiver and their fair limbs to float in motion like weeds unfolding in the ocean <\s>
<s> and their lips moved one seemed to speak when suddenly the mountains cracked 135 and through the chasm the flood did break with an earth uplifting cataract the statues gave a joyous scream and on its wings the pale thin dream lifted the lady from the stream <\s>
<s> the dizzy flight of that phantom pale waked the fair lady from her sleep and she arose while from the veil of her dark eyes the dream did creep and she walked about as one who knew 145 that sleep has sights as clear and true as any waking eyes can view <\s>

<s> a pale dream came to a lady fair and said a boon a boon i pray <\s>
<s> i know the secrets of the air and things are lost in the glare of day which i can make the sleeping see 5 if they will put their trust in me <\s>
<s> and thou shalt know of things unknown if thou wilt let me rest between the veiny lids whose fringe is thrown over thine eyes so dark and sheen 10 and half in hope and half in fright the lady closed her eyes so bright <\s>
<s> at first all deadly shapes were driven tumultuously across her sleep and o'er the vast cope of bending heaven 15 all ghastly visaged clouds did sweep and the lady ever looked to spy if the golden sun shone forth on high <\s>
<s> and as towards the east she turned she saw aloft in the morning air 20 which now with hues of sunrise burned a great black anchor rising there and wherever the lady turned her eyes it hung before her in the skies <\s>
<s> the sky was blue as the summer sea 25 the depths were cloudless overhead the air was calm as it could be there was no sight or sound of dread but that black anchor floating still over the piny eastern hill <\s>
<s> the lady grew sick with a weight of fear to see that anchor ever hanging and veiled her eyes she then did hear the sound as of a dim low clanging and looked abroad if she might know 35 was it aught else or but the flow of the blood in her own veins to and fro <\s>
<s> there was a mist in the sunless air which shook as it were with an earthquake's shock but the very weeds that blossomed there 40 were moveless and each mighty rock stood on its basis steadfastly the anchor was seen no more on high <\s>
<s> but piled around with summits hid in lines of cloud at intervals 45 stood many a mountain pyramid among whose everlasting walls two mighty cities shone and ever through the red mist their domes did quiver <\s>
<s> on two dread mountains from whose crest 50 might seem the eagle for her brood would ne'er have hung her dizzy nest those tower encircled cities stood <\s>
<s> a vision strange such towers to see sculptured and wrought so gorgeously 55 where human art could never be <\s>
<s> and columns framed of marble white and giant fanes dome over dome piled and triumphant gates all bright with workmanship which could not come 60 from touch of mortal instrument shot o'er the vales or lustre lent from its own shapes magnificent <\s>
<s> but still the lady heard that clang filling the wide air far away 65 and still the mist whose light did hang among the mountains shook alway so that the lady's heart beat fast as half in joy and half aghast on those high domes her look she cast <\s>
<s> sudden from out that city sprung a light that made the earth grow red two flames that each with quivering tongue licked its high domes and overhead among those mighty towers and fanes 75 dropped fire as a volcano rains its sulphurous ruin on the plains <\s>
<s> a rush as if the deep had burst its bonds she looked behind and saw over the western steep 80 a raging flood descend and wind through that wide vale she felt no fear but said within herself tis clear these towers are nature's own and she to save them has sent forth the sea <\s>
<s> and now those raging billows came where that fair lady sate and she was borne towards the showering flame by the wild waves heaped tumultuously <\s>
<s> and on a little plank the flow 90 of the whirlpool bore her to and fro <\s>
<s> the flames were fiercely vomited from every tower and every dome and dreary light did widely shed o'er that vast flood's suspended foam 95 beneath the smoke which hung its night on the stained cope of heaven's light <\s>
<s> the plank whereon that lady sate was driven through the chasms about and about between the peaks so desolate 100 of the drowning mountains in and out as the thistle beard on a whirlwind sails while the flood was filling those hollow vales <\s>
<s> at last her plank an eddy crossed and bore her to the city's wall 105 which now the flood had reached almost it might the stoutest heart appal to hear the fire roar and hiss through the domes of those mighty palaces <\s>
<s> the eddy whirled her round and round 110 before a gorgeous gate which stood piercing the clouds of smoke which bound its aery arch with light like blood she looked on that gate of marble clear with wonder that extinguished fear <\s>
<s> for it was filled with sculptures rarest of forms most beautiful and strange like nothing human but the fairest of winged shapes whose legions range throughout the sleep of those that are 120 like this same lady good and fair <\s>
<s> and as she looked still lovelier grew those marble forms the sculptor sure was a strong spirit and the hue of his own mind did there endure 125 after the touch whose power had braided such grace was in some sad change faded <\s>
<s> she looked the flames were dim the flood grew tranquil as a woodland river winding through hills in solitude 130 those marble shapes then seemed to quiver and their fair limbs to float in motion like weeds unfolding in the ocean <\s>
<s> and their lips moved one seemed to speak when suddenly the mountains cracked 135 and through the chasm the flood did break with an earth uplifting cataract the statues gave a joyous scream and on its wings the pale thin dream lifted the lady from the stream <\s>

<s> a pale dream came to a lady fair and said a boon a boon i pray <\s>
<s> i know the secrets of the air and things are lost in the glare of day which i can make the sleeping see 5 if they will put their trust in me <\s>
<s> and thou shalt know of things unknown if thou wilt let me rest between the veiny lids whose fringe is thrown over thine eyes so dark and sheen 10 and half in hope and half in fright the lady closed her eyes so bright <\s>
<s> at first all deadly shapes were driven tumultuously across her sleep and o'er the vast cope of bending heaven 15 all ghastly visaged clouds did sweep and the lady ever looked to spy if the golden sun shone forth on high <\s>
<s> and as towards the east she turned she saw aloft in the morning air 20 which now with hues of sunrise burned a great black anchor rising there and wherever the lady turned her eyes it hung before her in the skies <\s>
<s> the sky was blue as the summer sea 25 the depths were cloudless overhead the air was calm as it could be there was no sight or sound of dread but that black anchor floating still over the piny eastern hill <\s>
<s> the lady grew sick with a weight of fear to see that anchor ever hanging and veiled her eyes she then did hear the sound as of a dim low clanging and looked abroad if she might know 35 was it aught else or but the flow of the blood in her own veins to and fro <\s>
<s> there was a mist in the sunless air which shook as it were with an earthquake's shock but the very weeds that blossomed there 40 were moveless and each mighty rock stood on its basis steadfastly the anchor was seen no more on high <\s>
<s> but piled around with summits hid in lines of cloud at intervals 45 stood many a mountain pyramid among whose everlasting walls two mighty cities shone and ever through the red mist their domes did quiver <\s>
<s> on two dread mountains from whose crest 50 might seem the eagle for her brood would ne'er have hung her dizzy nest those tower encircled cities stood <\s>
<s> a vision strange such towers to see sculptured and wrought so gorgeously 55 where human art could never be <\s>
<s> and columns framed of marble white and giant fanes dome over dome piled and triumphant gates all bright with workmanship which could not come 60 from touch of mortal instrument shot o'er the vales or lustre lent from its own shapes magnificent <\s>
<s> but still the lady heard that clang filling the wide air far away 65 and still the mist whose light did hang among the mountains shook alway so that the lady's heart beat fast as half in joy and half aghast on those high domes her look she cast <\s>
<s> sudden from out that city sprung a light that made the earth grow red two flames that each with quivering tongue licked its high domes and overhead among those mighty towers and fanes 75 dropped fire as a volcano rains its sulphurous ruin on the plains <\s>
<s> a rush as if the deep had burst its bonds she looked behind and saw over the western steep 80 a raging flood descend and wind through that wide vale she felt no fear but said within herself tis clear these towers are nature's own and she to save them has sent forth the sea <\s>
<s> and now those raging billows came where that fair lady sate and she was borne towards the showering flame by the wild waves heaped tumultuously <\s>
<s> and on a little plank the flow 90 of the whirlpool bore her to and fro <\s>
<s> the flames were fiercely vomited from every tower and every dome and dreary light did widely shed o'er that vast flood's suspended foam 95 beneath the smoke which hung its night on the stained cope of heaven's light <\s>
<s> the plank whereon that lady sate was driven through the chasms about and about between the peaks so desolate 100 of the drowning mountains in and out as the thistle beard on a whirlwind sails while the flood was filling those hollow vales <\s>
<s> at last her plank an eddy crossed and bore her to the city's wall 105 which now the flood had reached almost it might the stoutest heart appal to hear the fire roar and hiss through the domes of those mighty palaces <\s>
<s> the eddy whirled her round and round 110 before a gorgeous gate which stood piercing the clouds of smoke which bound its aery arch with light like blood she looked on that gate of marble clear with wonder that extinguished fear <\s>
<s> for it was filled with sculptures rarest of forms most beautiful and strange like nothing human but the fairest of winged shapes whose legions range throughout the sleep of those that are 120 like this same lady good and fair <\s>
<s> and as she looked still lovelier grew those marble forms the sculptor sure was a strong spirit and the hue of his own mind did there endure 125 after the touch whose power had braided such grace was in some sad change faded <\s>
<s> she looked the flames were dim the flood grew tranquil as a woodland river winding through hills in solitude 130 those marble shapes then seemed to quiver and their fair limbs to float in motion like weeds unfolding in the ocean <\s>
<s> and their lips moved one seemed to speak when suddenly the mountains cracked 135 and through the chasm the flood did break with an earth uplifting cataract the statues gave a joyous scream and on its wings the pale thin dream lifted the lady from the stream <\s>

<s> shelley makes the following mention of this poem in his publication of the history of a six weeks tour and letters from switzerland the poem entitled mont blanc is written by the author of the two letters from chamouni and vevai <\s>

<s> there was a mist in the sunless air which shook as it were with an earthquake's shock but the very weeds that blossomed there 40 were moveless and each mighty rock stood on its basis steadfastly the anchor was seen no more on high <\s>

<s> note on poems of 1816 by mrs <\s>
<s> shelley wrote little during this year <\s>
<s> the poem entitled the sunset was written in the spring of the year while still residing at bishopsgate <\s>
<s> he spent the summer on the shores of the lake of geneva <\s>
<s> the hymn to intellectual beauty was conceived during his voyage round the lake with lord byron <\s>
<s> he occupied himself during this voyage by reading the nouvelle heloise for the first time <\s>
<s> the reading it on the very spot where the scenes are laid added to the interest and he was at once surprised and charmed by the passionate eloquence and earnest enthralling interest that pervade this work <\s>
<s> there was something in the character of saint preux in his abnegation of self and in the worship he paid to love that coincided with shelley's own disposition and though differing in many of the views and shocked by others yet the effect of the whole was fascinating and delightful <\s>
<s> mont blanc was inspired by a view of that mountain and its surrounding peaks and valleys as he lingered on the bridge of arve on his way through the valley of chamouni <\s>
<s> shelley makes the following mention of this poem in his publication of the history of a six weeks tour and letters from switzerland the poem entitled mont blanc is written by the author of the two letters from chamouni and vevai <\s>
<s> it was composed under the immediate impression of the deep and powerful feelings excited by the objects which it attempts to describe and as an undisciplined overflowing of the soul rests its claim to approbation on an attempt to imitate the untamable wildness and inaccessible solemnity from which those feelings sprang <\s>
<s> this was an eventful year and less time was given to study than usual <\s>
<s> in the list of his reading i find in greek theocritus the prometheus of aeschylus several of plutarch's lives and the works of lucian <\s>
<s> in latin lucretius pliny's letters the annals and germany of tacitus <\s>
<s> in french the history of the french revolution by lacretelle <\s>

<s> a pale dream came to a lady fair and said a boon a boon i pray <\s>
<s> i know the secrets of the air and things are lost in the glare of day which i can make the sleeping see 5 if they will put their trust in me <\s>
<s> and thou shalt know of things unknown if thou wilt let me rest between the veiny lids whose fringe is thrown over thine eyes so dark and sheen 10 and half in hope and half in fright the lady closed her eyes so bright <\s>
<s> at first all deadly shapes were driven tumultuously across her sleep and o'er the vast cope of bending heaven 15 all ghastly visaged clouds did sweep and the lady ever looked to spy if the golden sun shone forth on high <\s>
<s> and as towards the east she turned she saw aloft in the morning air 20 which now with hues of sunrise burned a great black anchor rising there and wherever the lady turned her eyes it hung before her in the skies <\s>
<s> the sky was blue as the summer sea 25 the depths were cloudless overhead the air was calm as it could be there was no sight or sound of dread but that black anchor floating still over the piny eastern hill <\s>
<s> the lady grew sick with a weight of fear to see that anchor ever hanging and veiled her eyes she then did hear the sound as of a dim low clanging and looked abroad if she might know 35 was it aught else or but the flow of the blood in her own veins to and fro <\s>
<s> there was a mist in the sunless air which shook as it were with an earthquake's shock but the very weeds that blossomed there 40 were moveless and each mighty rock stood on its basis steadfastly the anchor was seen no more on high <\s>
<s> but piled around with summits hid in lines of cloud at intervals 45 stood many a mountain pyramid among whose everlasting walls two mighty cities shone and ever through the red mist their domes did quiver <\s>
<s> on two dread mountains from whose crest 50 might seem the eagle for her brood would ne'er have hung her dizzy nest those tower encircled cities stood <\s>
<s> a vision strange such towers to see sculptured and wrought so gorgeously 55 where human art could never be <\s>
<s> and columns framed of marble white and giant fanes dome over dome piled and triumphant gates all bright with workmanship which could not come 60 from touch of mortal instrument shot o'er the vales or lustre lent from its own shapes magnificent <\s>
<s> but still the lady heard that clang filling the wide air far away 65 and still the mist whose light did hang among the mountains shook alway so that the lady's heart beat fast as half in joy and half aghast on those high domes her look she cast <\s>
<s> sudden from out that city sprung a light that made the earth grow red two flames that each with quivering tongue licked its high domes and overhead among those mighty towers and fanes 75 dropped fire as a volcano rains its sulphurous ruin on the plains <\s>
<s> a rush as if the deep had burst its bonds she looked behind and saw over the western steep 80 a raging flood descend and wind through that wide vale she felt no fear but said within herself tis clear these towers are nature's own and she to save them has sent forth the sea <\s>
<s> and now those raging billows came where that fair lady sate and she was borne towards the showering flame by the wild waves heaped tumultuously <\s>
<s> and on a little plank the flow 90 of the whirlpool bore her to and fro <\s>
<s> the flames were fiercely vomited from every tower and every dome and dreary light did widely shed o'er that vast flood's suspended foam 95 beneath the smoke which hung its night on the stained cope of heaven's light <\s>
<s> the plank whereon that lady sate was driven through the chasms about and about between the peaks so desolate 100 of the drowning mountains in and out as the thistle beard on a whirlwind sails while the flood was filling those hollow vales <\s>
<s> at last her plank an eddy crossed and bore her to the city's wall 105 which now the flood had reached almost it might the stoutest heart appal to hear the fire roar and hiss through the domes of those mighty palaces <\s>
<s> the eddy whirled her round and round 110 before a gorgeous gate which stood piercing the clouds of smoke which bound its aery arch with light like blood she looked on that gate of marble clear with wonder that extinguished fear <\s>
<s> for it was filled with sculptures rarest of forms most beautiful and strange like nothing human but the fairest of winged shapes whose legions range throughout the sleep of those that are 120 like this same lady good and fair <\s>
<s> and as she looked still lovelier grew those marble forms the sculptor sure was a strong spirit and the hue of his own mind did there endure 125 after the touch whose power had braided such grace was in some sad change faded <\s>
<s> she looked the flames were dim the flood grew tranquil as a woodland river winding through hills in solitude 130 those marble shapes then seemed to quiver and their fair limbs to float in motion like weeds unfolding in the ocean <\s>
<s> and their lips moved one seemed to speak when suddenly the mountains cracked 135 and through the chasm the flood did break with an earth uplifting cataract the statues gave a joyous scream and on its wings the pale thin dream lifted the lady from the stream <\s>
<s> the dizzy flight of that phantom pale waked the fair lady from her sleep and she arose while from the veil of her dark eyes the dream did creep and she walked about as one who knew 145 that sleep has sights as clear and true as any waking eyes can view <\s>

<s> a pale dream came to a lady fair and said a boon a boon i pray <\s>
<s> i know the secrets of the air and things are lost in the glare of day which i can make the sleeping see 5 if they will put their trust in me <\s>
<s> and thou shalt know of things unknown if thou wilt let me rest between the veiny lids whose fringe is thrown over thine eyes so dark and sheen 10 and half in hope and half in fright the lady closed her eyes so bright <\s>
<s> at first all deadly shapes were driven tumultuously across her sleep and o'er the vast cope of bending heaven 15 all ghastly visaged clouds did sweep and the lady ever looked to spy if the golden sun shone forth on high <\s>
<s> and as towards the east she turned she saw aloft in the morning air 20 which now with hues of sunrise burned a great black anchor rising there and wherever the lady turned her eyes it hung before her in the skies <\s>
<s> the sky was blue as the summer sea 25 the depths were cloudless overhead the air was calm as it could be there was no sight or sound of dread but that black anchor floating still over the piny eastern hill <\s>
<s> the lady grew sick with a weight of fear to see that anchor ever hanging and veiled her eyes she then did hear the sound as of a dim low clanging and looked abroad if she might know 35 was it aught else or but the flow of the blood in her own veins to and fro <\s>
<s> there was a mist in the sunless air which shook as it were with an earthquake's shock but the very weeds that blossomed there 40 were moveless and each mighty rock stood on its basis steadfastly the anchor was seen no more on high <\s>
<s> but piled around with summits hid in lines of cloud at intervals 45 stood many a mountain pyramid among whose everlasting walls two mighty cities shone and ever through the red mist their domes did quiver <\s>
<s> on two dread mountains from whose crest 50 might seem the eagle for her brood would ne'er have hung her dizzy nest those tower encircled cities stood <\s>
<s> a vision strange such towers to see sculptured and wrought so gorgeously 55 where human art could never be <\s>
<s> and columns framed of marble white and giant fanes dome over dome piled and triumphant gates all bright with workmanship which could not come 60 from touch of mortal instrument shot o'er the vales or lustre lent from its own shapes magnificent <\s>
<s> but still the lady heard that clang filling the wide air far away 65 and still the mist whose light did hang among the mountains shook alway so that the lady's heart beat fast as half in joy and half aghast on those high domes her look she cast <\s>
<s> sudden from out that city sprung a light that made the earth grow red two flames that each with quivering tongue licked its high domes and overhead among those mighty towers and fanes 75 dropped fire as a volcano rains its sulphurous ruin on the plains <\s>
<s> a rush as if the deep had burst its bonds she looked behind and saw over the western steep 80 a raging flood descend and wind through that wide vale she felt no fear but said within herself tis clear these towers are nature's own and she to save them has sent forth the sea <\s>
<s> and now those raging billows came where that fair lady sate and she was borne towards the showering flame by the wild waves heaped tumultuously <\s>
<s> and on a little plank the flow 90 of the whirlpool bore her to and fro <\s>
<s> the flames were fiercely vomited from every tower and every dome and dreary light did widely shed o'er that vast flood's suspended foam 95 beneath the smoke which hung its night on the stained cope of heaven's light <\s>
<s> the plank whereon that lady sate was driven through the chasms about and about between the peaks so desolate 100 of the drowning mountains in and out as the thistle beard on a whirlwind sails while the flood was filling those hollow vales <\s>
<s> at last her plank an eddy crossed and bore her to the city's wall 105 which now the flood had reached almost it might the stoutest heart appal to hear the fire roar and hiss through the domes of those mighty palaces <\s>
<s> the eddy whirled her round and round 110 before a gorgeous gate which stood piercing the clouds of smoke which bound its aery arch with light like blood she looked on that gate of marble clear with wonder that extinguished fear <\s>
<s> for it was filled with sculptures rarest of forms most beautiful and strange like nothing human but the fairest of winged shapes whose legions range throughout the sleep of those that are 120 like this same lady good and fair <\s>
<s> and as she looked still lovelier grew those marble forms the sculptor sure was a strong spirit and the hue of his own mind did there endure 125 after the touch whose power had braided such grace was in some sad change faded <\s>
<s> she looked the flames were dim the flood grew tranquil as a woodland river winding through hills in solitude 130 those marble shapes then seemed to quiver and their fair limbs to float in motion like weeds unfolding in the ocean <\s>
<s> and their lips moved one seemed to speak when suddenly the mountains cracked 135 and through the chasm the flood did break with an earth uplifting cataract the statues gave a joyous scream and on its wings the pale thin dream lifted the lady from the stream <\s>

<s> a pale dream came to a lady fair and said a boon a boon i pray <\s>
<s> i know the secrets of the air and things are lost in the glare of day which i can make the sleeping see 5 if they will put their trust in me <\s>
<s> and thou shalt know of things unknown if thou wilt let me rest between the veiny lids whose fringe is thrown over thine eyes so dark and sheen 10 and half in hope and half in fright the lady closed her eyes so bright <\s>
<s> at first all deadly shapes were driven tumultuously across her sleep and o'er the vast cope of bending heaven 15 all ghastly visaged clouds did sweep and the lady ever looked to spy if the golden sun shone forth on high <\s>
<s> and as towards the east she turned she saw aloft in the morning air 20 which now with hues of sunrise burned a great black anchor rising there and wherever the lady turned her eyes it hung before her in the skies <\s>
<s> the sky was blue as the summer sea 25 the depths were cloudless overhead the air was calm as it could be there was no sight or sound of dread but that black anchor floating still over the piny eastern hill <\s>
<s> the lady grew sick with a weight of fear to see that anchor ever hanging and veiled her eyes she then did hear the sound as of a dim low clanging and looked abroad if she might know 35 was it aught else or but the flow of the blood in her own veins to and fro <\s>
<s> there was a mist in the sunless air which shook as it were with an earthquake's shock but the very weeds that blossomed there 40 were moveless and each mighty rock stood on its basis steadfastly the anchor was seen no more on high <\s>
<s> but piled around with summits hid in lines of cloud at intervals 45 stood many a mountain pyramid among whose everlasting walls two mighty cities shone and ever through the red mist their domes did quiver <\s>
<s> on two dread mountains from whose crest 50 might seem the eagle for her brood would ne'er have hung her dizzy nest those tower encircled cities stood <\s>
<s> a vision strange such towers to see sculptured and wrought so gorgeously 55 where human art could never be <\s>
<s> and columns framed of marble white and giant fanes dome over dome piled and triumphant gates all bright with workmanship which could not come 60 from touch of mortal instrument shot o'er the vales or lustre lent from its own shapes magnificent <\s>
<s> but still the lady heard that clang filling the wide air far away 65 and still the mist whose light did hang among the mountains shook alway so that the lady's heart beat fast as half in joy and half aghast on those high domes her look she cast <\s>
<s> sudden from out that city sprung a light that made the earth grow red two flames that each with quivering tongue licked its high domes and overhead among those mighty towers and fanes 75 dropped fire as a volcano rains its sulphurous ruin on the plains <\s>
<s> a rush as if the deep had burst its bonds she looked behind and saw over the western steep 80 a raging flood descend and wind through that wide vale she felt no fear but said within herself tis clear these towers are nature's own and she to save them has sent forth the sea <\s>
<s> and now those raging billows came where that fair lady sate and she was borne towards the showering flame by the wild waves heaped tumultuously <\s>
<s> and on a little plank the flow 90 of the whirlpool bore her to and fro <\s>
<s> the flames were fiercely vomited from every tower and every dome and dreary light did widely shed o'er that vast flood's suspended foam 95 beneath the smoke which hung its night on the stained cope of heaven's light <\s>

<s> the eddy whirled her round and round 110 before a gorgeous gate which stood piercing the clouds of smoke which bound its aery arch with light like blood she looked on that gate of marble clear with wonder that extinguished fear <\s>
<s> for it was filled with sculptures rarest of forms most beautiful and strange like nothing human but the fairest of winged shapes whose legions range throughout the sleep of those that are 120 like this same lady good and fair <\s>
<s> and as she looked still lovelier grew those marble forms the sculptor sure was a strong spirit and the hue of his own mind did there endure 125 after the touch whose power had braided such grace was in some sad change faded <\s>
<s> she looked the flames were dim the flood grew tranquil as a woodland river winding through hills in solitude 130 those marble shapes then seemed to quiver and their fair limbs to float in motion like weeds unfolding in the ocean <\s>
<s> and their lips moved one seemed to speak when suddenly the mountains cracked 135 and through the chasm the flood did break with an earth uplifting cataract the statues gave a joyous scream and on its wings the pale thin dream lifted the lady from the stream <\s>

<s> shelley makes the following mention of this poem in his publication of the history of a six weeks tour and letters from switzerland the poem entitled mont blanc is written by the author of the two letters from chamouni and vevai <\s>

<s> a pale dream came to a lady fair and said a boon a boon i pray <\s>
<s> i know the secrets of the air and things are lost in the glare of day which i can make the sleeping see 5 if they will put their trust in me <\s>
<s> and thou shalt know of things unknown if thou wilt let me rest between the veiny lids whose fringe is thrown over thine eyes so dark and sheen 10 and half in hope and half in fright the lady closed her eyes so bright <\s>
<s> at first all deadly shapes were driven tumultuously across her sleep and o'er the vast cope of bending heaven 15 all ghastly visaged clouds did sweep and the lady ever looked to spy if the golden sun shone forth on high <\s>
<s> and as towards the east she turned she saw aloft in the morning air 20 which now with hues of sunrise burned a great black anchor rising there and wherever the lady turned her eyes it hung before her in the skies <\s>
<s> the sky was blue as the summer sea 25 the depths were cloudless overhead the air was calm as it could be there was no sight or sound of dread but that black anchor floating still over the piny eastern hill <\s>
<s> the lady grew sick with a weight of fear to see that anchor ever hanging and veiled her eyes she then did hear the sound as of a dim low clanging and looked abroad if she might know 35 was it aught else or but the flow of the blood in her own veins to and fro <\s>
<s> there was a mist in the sunless air which shook as it were with an earthquake's shock but the very weeds that blossomed there 40 were moveless and each mighty rock stood on its basis steadfastly the anchor was seen no more on high <\s>
<s> but piled around with summits hid in lines of cloud at intervals 45 stood many a mountain pyramid among whose everlasting walls two mighty cities shone and ever through the red mist their domes did quiver <\s>
<s> on two dread mountains from whose crest 50 might seem the eagle for her brood would ne'er have hung her dizzy nest those tower encircled cities stood <\s>

<s> and columns framed of marble white and giant fanes dome over dome piled and triumphant gates all bright with workmanship which could not come 60 from touch of mortal instrument shot o'er the vales or lustre lent from its own shapes magnificent <\s>
<s> but still the lady heard that clang filling the wide air far away 65 and still the mist whose light did hang among the mountains shook alway so that the lady's heart beat fast as half in joy and half aghast on those high domes her look she cast <\s>
<s> sudden from out that city sprung a light that made the earth grow red two flames that each with quivering tongue licked its high domes and overhead among those mighty towers and fanes 75 dropped fire as a volcano rains its sulphurous ruin on the plains <\s>
<s> a rush as if the deep had burst its bonds she looked behind and saw over the western steep 80 a raging flood descend and wind through that wide vale she felt no fear but said within herself tis clear these towers are nature's own and she to save them has sent forth the sea <\s>
<s> and now those raging billows came where that fair lady sate and she was borne towards the showering flame by the wild waves heaped tumultuously <\s>
<s> and on a little plank the flow 90 of the whirlpool bore her to and fro <\s>
<s> the flames were fiercely vomited from every tower and every dome and dreary light did widely shed o'er that vast flood's suspended foam 95 beneath the smoke which hung its night on the stained cope of heaven's light <\s>

<s> the eddy whirled her round and round 110 before a gorgeous gate which stood piercing the clouds of smoke which bound its aery arch with light like blood she looked on that gate of marble clear with wonder that extinguished fear <\s>

<s> a pale dream came to a lady fair and said a boon a boon i pray <\s>
<s> i know the secrets of the air and things are lost in the glare of day which i can make the sleeping see 5 if they will put their trust in me <\s>
<s> and thou shalt know of things unknown if thou wilt let me rest between the veiny lids whose fringe is thrown over thine eyes so dark and sheen 10 and half in hope and half in fright the lady closed her eyes so bright <\s>
<s> at first all deadly shapes were driven tumultuously across her sleep and o'er the vast cope of bending heaven 15 all ghastly visaged clouds did sweep and the lady ever looked to spy if the golden sun shone forth on high <\s>
<s> and as towards the east she turned she saw aloft in the morning air 20 which now with hues of sunrise burned a great black anchor rising there and wherever the lady turned her eyes it hung before her in the skies <\s>
<s> the sky was blue as the summer sea 25 the depths were cloudless overhead the air was calm as it could be there was no sight or sound of dread but that black anchor floating still over the piny eastern hill <\s>
<s> the lady grew sick with a weight of fear to see that anchor ever hanging and veiled her eyes she then did hear the sound as of a dim low clanging and looked abroad if she might know 35 was it aught else or but the flow of the blood in her own veins to and fro <\s>
<s> there was a mist in the sunless air which shook as it were with an earthquake's shock but the very weeds that blossomed there 40 were moveless and each mighty rock stood on its basis steadfastly the anchor was seen no more on high <\s>
<s> but piled around with summits hid in lines of cloud at intervals 45 stood many a mountain pyramid among whose everlasting walls two mighty cities shone and ever through the red mist their domes did quiver <\s>
<s> on two dread mountains from whose crest 50 might seem the eagle for her brood would ne'er have hung her dizzy nest those tower encircled cities stood <\s>
<s> a vision strange such towers to see sculptured and wrought so gorgeously 55 where human art could never be <\s>
<s> and columns framed of marble white and giant fanes dome over dome piled and triumphant gates all bright with workmanship which could not come 60 from touch of mortal instrument shot o'er the vales or lustre lent from its own shapes magnificent <\s>
<s> but still the lady heard that clang filling the wide air far away 65 and still the mist whose light did hang among the mountains shook alway so that the lady's heart beat fast as half in joy and half aghast on those high domes her look she cast <\s>
<s> sudden from out that city sprung a light that made the earth grow red two flames that each with quivering tongue licked its high domes and overhead among those mighty towers and fanes 75 dropped fire as a volcano rains its sulphurous ruin on the plains <\s>
<s> a rush as if the deep had burst its bonds she looked behind and saw over the western steep 80 a raging flood descend and wind through that wide vale she felt no fear but said within herself tis clear these towers are nature's own and she to save them has sent forth the sea <\s>
<s> and now those raging billows came where that fair lady sate and she was borne towards the showering flame by the wild waves heaped tumultuously <\s>
<s> and on a little plank the flow 90 of the whirlpool bore her to and fro <\s>
<s> the flames were fiercely vomited from every tower and every dome and dreary light did widely shed o'er that vast flood's suspended foam 95 beneath the smoke which hung its night on the stained cope of heaven's light <\s>
<s> the plank whereon that lady sate was driven through the chasms about and about between the peaks so desolate 100 of the drowning mountains in and out as the thistle beard on a whirlwind sails while the flood was filling those hollow vales <\s>
<s> at last her plank an eddy crossed and bore her to the city's wall 105 which now the flood had reached almost it might the stoutest heart appal to hear the fire roar and hiss through the domes of those mighty palaces <\s>
<s> the eddy whirled her round and round 110 before a gorgeous gate which stood piercing the clouds of smoke which bound its aery arch with light like blood she looked on that gate of marble clear with wonder that extinguished fear <\s>
<s> for it was filled with sculptures rarest of forms most beautiful and strange like nothing human but the fairest of winged shapes whose legions range throughout the sleep of those that are 120 like this same lady good and fair <\s>
<s> and as she looked still lovelier grew those marble forms the sculptor sure was a strong spirit and the hue of his own mind did there endure 125 after the touch whose power had braided such grace was in some sad change faded <\s>
<s> she looked the flames were dim the flood grew tranquil as a woodland river winding through hills in solitude 130 those marble shapes then seemed to quiver and their fair limbs to float in motion like weeds unfolding in the ocean <\s>
<s> and their lips moved one seemed to speak when suddenly the mountains cracked 135 and through the chasm the flood did break with an earth uplifting cataract the statues gave a joyous scream and on its wings the pale thin dream lifted the lady from the stream <\s>
<s> the dizzy flight of that phantom pale waked the fair lady from her sleep and she arose while from the veil of her dark eyes the dream did creep and she walked about as one who knew 145 that sleep has sights as clear and true as any waking eyes can view <\s>

<s> note on poems of 1816 by mrs <\s>

<s> a pale dream came to a lady fair and said a boon a boon i pray <\s>
<s> i know the secrets of the air and things are lost in the glare of day which i can make the sleeping see 5 if they will put their trust in me <\s>
<s> and thou shalt know of things unknown if thou wilt let me rest between the veiny lids whose fringe is thrown over thine eyes so dark and sheen 10 and half in hope and half in fright the lady closed her eyes so bright <\s>
<s> at first all deadly shapes were driven tumultuously across her sleep and o'er the vast cope of bending heaven 15 all ghastly visaged clouds did sweep and the lady ever looked to spy if the golden sun shone forth on high <\s>
<s> and as towards the east she turned she saw aloft in the morning air 20 which now with hues of sunrise burned a great black anchor rising there and wherever the lady turned her eyes it hung before her in the skies <\s>
<s> the sky was blue as the summer sea 25 the depths were cloudless overhead the air was calm as it could be there was no sight or sound of dread but that black anchor floating still over the piny eastern hill <\s>
<s> the lady grew sick with a weight of fear to see that anchor ever hanging and veiled her eyes she then did hear the sound as of a dim low clanging and looked abroad if she might know 35 was it aught else or but the flow of the blood in her own veins to and fro <\s>
<s> there was a mist in the sunless air which shook as it were with an earthquake's shock but the very weeds that blossomed there 40 were moveless and each mighty rock stood on its basis steadfastly the anchor was seen no more on high <\s>
<s> but piled around with summits hid in lines of cloud at intervals 45 stood many a mountain pyramid among whose everlasting walls two mighty cities shone and ever through the red mist their domes did quiver <\s>
<s> on two dread mountains from whose crest 50 might seem the eagle for her brood would ne'er have hung her dizzy nest those tower encircled cities stood <\s>
<s> a vision strange such towers to see sculptured and wrought so gorgeously 55 where human art could never be <\s>
<s> and columns framed of marble white and giant fanes dome over dome piled and triumphant gates all bright with workmanship which could not come 60 from touch of mortal instrument shot o'er the vales or lustre lent from its own shapes magnificent <\s>
<s> but still the lady heard that clang filling the wide air far away 65 and still the mist whose light did hang among the mountains shook alway so that the lady's heart beat fast as half in joy and half aghast on those high domes her look she cast <\s>
<s> sudden from out that city sprung a light that made the earth grow red two flames that each with quivering tongue licked its high domes and overhead among those mighty towers and fanes 75 dropped fire as a volcano rains its sulphurous ruin on the plains <\s>
<s> a rush as if the deep had burst its bonds she looked behind and saw over the western steep 80 a raging flood descend and wind through that wide vale she felt no fear but said within herself tis clear these towers are nature's own and she to save them has sent forth the sea <\s>
<s> and now those raging billows came where that fair lady sate and she was borne towards the showering flame by the wild waves heaped tumultuously <\s>
<s> and on a little plank the flow 90 of the whirlpool bore her to and fro <\s>
<s> the flames were fiercely vomited from every tower and every dome and dreary light did widely shed o'er that vast flood's suspended foam 95 beneath the smoke which hung its night on the stained cope of heaven's light <\s>
<s> the plank whereon that lady sate was driven through the chasms about and about between the peaks so desolate 100 of the drowning mountains in and out as the thistle beard on a whirlwind sails while the flood was filling those hollow vales <\s>
<s> at last her plank an eddy crossed and bore her to the city's wall 105 which now the flood had reached almost it might the stoutest heart appal to hear the fire roar and hiss through the domes of those mighty palaces <\s>
<s> the eddy whirled her round and round 110 before a gorgeous gate which stood piercing the clouds of smoke which bound its aery arch with light like blood she looked on that gate of marble clear with wonder that extinguished fear <\s>
<s> for it was filled with sculptures rarest of forms most beautiful and strange like nothing human but the fairest of winged shapes whose legions range throughout the sleep of those that are 120 like this same lady good and fair <\s>
<s> and as she looked still lovelier grew those marble forms the sculptor sure was a strong spirit and the hue of his own mind did there endure 125 after the touch whose power had braided such grace was in some sad change faded <\s>
<s> she looked the flames were dim the flood grew tranquil as a woodland river winding through hills in solitude 130 those marble shapes then seemed to quiver and their fair limbs to float in motion like weeds unfolding in the ocean <\s>
<s> and their lips moved one seemed to speak when suddenly the mountains cracked 135 and through the chasm the flood did break with an earth uplifting cataract the statues gave a joyous scream and on its wings the pale thin dream lifted the lady from the stream <\s>
<s> the dizzy flight of that phantom pale waked the fair lady from her sleep and she arose while from the veil of her dark eyes the dream did creep and she walked about as one who knew 145 that sleep has sights as clear and true as any waking eyes can view <\s>

<s> i know the secrets of the air and things are lost in the glare of day which i can make the sleeping see 5 if they will put their trust in me <\s>
<s> and thou shalt know of things unknown if thou wilt let me rest between the veiny lids whose fringe is thrown over thine eyes so dark and sheen 10 and half in hope and half in fright the lady closed her eyes so bright <\s>
<s> at first all deadly shapes were driven tumultuously across her sleep and o'er the vast cope of bending heaven 15 all ghastly visaged clouds did sweep and the lady ever looked to spy if the golden sun shone forth on high <\s>
<s> and as towards the east she turned she saw aloft in the morning air 20 which now with hues of sunrise burned a great black anchor rising there and wherever the lady turned her eyes it hung before her in the skies <\s>
<s> the sky was blue as the summer sea 25 the depths were cloudless overhead the air was calm as it could be there was no sight or sound of dread but that black anchor floating still over the piny eastern hill <\s>
<s> the lady grew sick with a weight of fear to see that anchor ever hanging and veiled her eyes she then did hear the sound as of a dim low clanging and looked abroad if she might know 35 was it aught else or but the flow of the blood in her own veins to and fro <\s>
<s> there was a mist in the sunless air which shook as it were with an earthquake's shock but the very weeds that blossomed there 40 were moveless and each mighty rock stood on its basis steadfastly the anchor was seen no more on high <\s>

<s> but still the lady heard that clang filling the wide air far away 65 and still the mist whose light did hang among the mountains shook alway so that the lady's heart beat fast as half in joy and half aghast on those high domes her look she cast <\s>
<s> sudden from out that city sprung a light that made the earth grow red two flames that each with quivering tongue licked its high domes and overhead among those mighty towers and fanes 75 dropped fire as a volcano rains its sulphurous ruin on the plains <\s>
<s> a rush as if the deep had burst its bonds she looked behind and saw over the western steep 80 a raging flood descend and wind through that wide vale she felt no fear but said within herself tis clear these towers are nature's own and she to save them has sent forth the sea <\s>
<s> and now those raging billows came where that fair lady sate and she was borne towards the showering flame by the wild waves heaped tumultuously <\s>
<s> and on a little plank the flow 90 of the whirlpool bore her to and fro <\s>
<s> the flames were fiercely vomited from every tower and every dome and dreary light did widely shed o'er that vast flood's suspended foam 95 beneath the smoke which hung its night on the stained cope of heaven's light <\s>

<s> at last her plank an eddy crossed and bore her to the city's wall 105 which now the flood had reached almost it might the stoutest heart appal to hear the fire roar and hiss through the domes of those mighty palaces <\s>
<s> the eddy whirled her round and round 110 before a gorgeous gate which stood piercing the clouds of smoke which bound its aery arch with light like blood she looked on that gate of marble clear with wonder that extinguished fear <\s>
<s> for it was filled with sculptures rarest of forms most beautiful and strange like nothing human but the fairest of winged shapes whose legions range throughout the sleep of those that are 120 like this same lady good and fair <\s>
<s> and as she looked still lovelier grew those marble forms the sculptor sure was a strong spirit and the hue of his own mind did there endure 125 after the touch whose power had braided such grace was in some sad change faded <\s>
<s> she looked the flames were dim the flood grew tranquil as a woodland river winding through hills in solitude 130 those marble shapes then seemed to quiver and their fair limbs to float in motion like weeds unfolding in the ocean <\s>
<s> and their lips moved one seemed to speak when suddenly the mountains cracked 135 and through the chasm the flood did break with an earth uplifting cataract the statues gave a joyous scream and on its wings the pale thin dream lifted the lady from the stream <\s>

<s> note on poems of 1816 by mrs <\s>

<s> the reading it on the very spot where the scenes are laid added to the interest and he was at once surprised and charmed by the passionate eloquence and earnest enthralling interest that pervade this work <\s>

<s> shelley makes the following mention of this poem in his publication of the history of a six weeks tour and letters from switzerland the poem entitled mont blanc is written by the author of the two letters from chamouni and vevai <\s>

<s> and thou shalt know of things unknown if thou wilt let me rest between the veiny lids whose fringe is thrown over thine eyes so dark and sheen 10 and half in hope and half in fright the lady closed her eyes so bright <\s>
<s> at first all deadly shapes were driven tumultuously across her sleep and o'er the vast cope of bending heaven 15 all ghastly visaged clouds did sweep and the lady ever looked to spy if the golden sun shone forth on high <\s>
<s> and as towards the east she turned she saw aloft in the morning air 20 which now with hues of sunrise burned a great black anchor rising there and wherever the lady turned her eyes it hung before her in the skies <\s>
<s> the sky was blue as the summer sea 25 the depths were cloudless overhead the air was calm as it could be there was no sight or sound of dread but that black anchor floating still over the piny eastern hill <\s>

<s> there was a mist in the sunless air which shook as it were with an earthquake's shock but the very weeds that blossomed there 40 were moveless and each mighty rock stood on its basis steadfastly the anchor was seen no more on high <\s>

<s> a pale dream came to a lady fair and said a boon a boon i pray <\s>
<s> i know the secrets of the air and things are lost in the glare of day which i can make the sleeping see 5 if they will put their trust in me <\s>
<s> and thou shalt know of things unknown if thou wilt let me rest between the veiny lids whose fringe is thrown over thine eyes so dark and sheen 10 and half in hope and half in fright the lady closed her eyes so bright <\s>
<s> at first all deadly shapes were driven tumultuously across her sleep and o'er the vast cope of bending heaven 15 all ghastly visaged clouds did sweep and the lady ever looked to spy if the golden sun shone forth on high <\s>
<s> and as towards the east she turned she saw aloft in the morning air 20 which now with hues of sunrise burned a great black anchor rising there and wherever the lady turned her eyes it hung before her in the skies <\s>
<s> the sky was blue as the summer sea 25 the depths were cloudless overhead the air was calm as it could be there was no sight or sound of dread but that black anchor floating still over the piny eastern hill <\s>
<s> the lady grew sick with a weight of fear to see that anchor ever hanging and veiled her eyes she then did hear the sound as of a dim low clanging and looked abroad if she might know 35 was it aught else or but the flow of the blood in her own veins to and fro <\s>
<s> there was a mist in the sunless air which shook as it were with an earthquake's shock but the very weeds that blossomed there 40 were moveless and each mighty rock stood on its basis steadfastly the anchor was seen no more on high <\s>
<s> but piled around with summits hid in lines of cloud at intervals 45 stood many a mountain pyramid among whose everlasting walls two mighty cities shone and ever through the red mist their domes did quiver <\s>
<s> on two dread mountains from whose crest 50 might seem the eagle for her brood would ne'er have hung her dizzy nest those tower encircled cities stood <\s>
<s> a vision strange such towers to see sculptured and wrought so gorgeously 55 where human art could never be <\s>
<s> and columns framed of marble white and giant fanes dome over dome piled and triumphant gates all bright with workmanship which could not come 60 from touch of mortal instrument shot o'er the vales or lustre lent from its own shapes magnificent <\s>
<s> but still the lady heard that clang filling the wide air far away 65 and still the mist whose light did hang among the mountains shook alway so that the lady's heart beat fast as half in joy and half aghast on those high domes her look she cast <\s>
<s> sudden from out that city sprung a light that made the earth grow red two flames that each with quivering tongue licked its high domes and overhead among those mighty towers and fanes 75 dropped fire as a volcano rains its sulphurous ruin on the plains <\s>
<s> a rush as if the deep had burst its bonds she looked behind and saw over the western steep 80 a raging flood descend and wind through that wide vale she felt no fear but said within herself tis clear these towers are nature's own and she to save them has sent forth the sea <\s>
<s> and now those raging billows came where that fair lady sate and she was borne towards the showering flame by the wild waves heaped tumultuously <\s>
<s> and on a little plank the flow 90 of the whirlpool bore her to and fro <\s>
<s> the flames were fiercely vomited from every tower and every dome and dreary light did widely shed o'er that vast flood's suspended foam 95 beneath the smoke which hung its night on the stained cope of heaven's light <\s>
<s> the plank whereon that lady sate was driven through the chasms about and about between the peaks so desolate 100 of the drowning mountains in and out as the thistle beard on a whirlwind sails while the flood was filling those hollow vales <\s>
<s> at last her plank an eddy crossed and bore her to the city's wall 105 which now the flood had reached almost it might the stoutest heart appal to hear the fire roar and hiss through the domes of those mighty palaces <\s>
<s> the eddy whirled her round and round 110 before a gorgeous gate which stood piercing the clouds of smoke which bound its aery arch with light like blood she looked on that gate of marble clear with wonder that extinguished fear <\s>
<s> for it was filled with sculptures rarest of forms most beautiful and strange like nothing human but the fairest of winged shapes whose legions range throughout the sleep of those that are 120 like this same lady good and fair <\s>
<s> and as she looked still lovelier grew those marble forms the sculptor sure was a strong spirit and the hue of his own mind did there endure 125 after the touch whose power had braided such grace was in some sad change faded <\s>
<s> she looked the flames were dim the flood grew tranquil as a woodland river winding through hills in solitude 130 those marble shapes then seemed to quiver and their fair limbs to float in motion like weeds unfolding in the ocean <\s>
<s> and their lips moved one seemed to speak when suddenly the mountains cracked 135 and through the chasm the flood did break with an earth uplifting cataract the statues gave a joyous scream and on its wings the pale thin dream lifted the lady from the stream <\s>

<s> a pale dream came to a lady fair and said a boon a boon i pray <\s>
<s> i know the secrets of the air and things are lost in the glare of day which i can make the sleeping see 5 if they will put their trust in me <\s>
<s> and thou shalt know of things unknown if thou wilt let me rest between the veiny lids whose fringe is thrown over thine eyes so dark and sheen 10 and half in hope and half in fright the lady closed her eyes so bright <\s>
<s> at first all deadly shapes were driven tumultuously across her sleep and o'er the vast cope of bending heaven 15 all ghastly visaged clouds did sweep and the lady ever looked to spy if the golden sun shone forth on high <\s>
<s> and as towards the east she turned she saw aloft in the morning air 20 which now with hues of sunrise burned a great black anchor rising there and wherever the lady turned her eyes it hung before her in the skies <\s>
<s> the sky was blue as the summer sea 25 the depths were cloudless overhead the air was calm as it could be there was no sight or sound of dread but that black anchor floating still over the piny eastern hill <\s>
<s> the lady grew sick with a weight of fear to see that anchor ever hanging and veiled her eyes she then did hear the sound as of a dim low clanging and looked abroad if she might know 35 was it aught else or but the flow of the blood in her own veins to and fro <\s>
<s> there was a mist in the sunless air which shook as it were with an earthquake's shock but the very weeds that blossomed there 40 were moveless and each mighty rock stood on its basis steadfastly the anchor was seen no more on high <\s>
<s> but piled around with summits hid in lines of cloud at intervals 45 stood many a mountain pyramid among whose everlasting walls two mighty cities shone and ever through the red mist their domes did quiver <\s>
<s> on two dread mountains from whose crest 50 might seem the eagle for her brood would ne'er have hung her dizzy nest those tower encircled cities stood <\s>
<s> a vision strange such towers to see sculptured and wrought so gorgeously 55 where human art could never be <\s>
<s> and columns framed of marble white and giant fanes dome over dome piled and triumphant gates all bright with workmanship which could not come 60 from touch of mortal instrument shot o'er the vales or lustre lent from its own shapes magnificent <\s>
<s> but still the lady heard that clang filling the wide air far away 65 and still the mist whose light did hang among the mountains shook alway so that the lady's heart beat fast as half in joy and half aghast on those high domes her look she cast <\s>
<s> sudden from out that city sprung a light that made the earth grow red two flames that each with quivering tongue licked its high domes and overhead among those mighty towers and fanes 75 dropped fire as a volcano rains its sulphurous ruin on the plains <\s>
<s> a rush as if the deep had burst its bonds she looked behind and saw over the western steep 80 a raging flood descend and wind through that wide vale she felt no fear but said within herself tis clear these towers are nature's own and she to save them has sent forth the sea <\s>
<s> and now those raging billows came where that fair lady sate and she was borne towards the showering flame by the wild waves heaped tumultuously <\s>
<s> and on a little plank the flow 90 of the whirlpool bore her to and fro <\s>
<s> the flames were fiercely vomited from every tower and every dome and dreary light did widely shed o'er that vast flood's suspended foam 95 beneath the smoke which hung its night on the stained cope of heaven's light <\s>

<s> at last her plank an eddy crossed and bore her to the city's wall 105 which now the flood had reached almost it might the stoutest heart appal to hear the fire roar and hiss through the domes of those mighty palaces <\s>
<s> the eddy whirled her round and round 110 before a gorgeous gate which stood piercing the clouds of smoke which bound its aery arch with light like blood she looked on that gate of marble clear with wonder that extinguished fear <\s>
<s> for it was filled with sculptures rarest of forms most beautiful and strange like nothing human but the fairest of winged shapes whose legions range throughout the sleep of those that are 120 like this same lady good and fair <\s>
<s> and as she looked still lovelier grew those marble forms the sculptor sure was a strong spirit and the hue of his own mind did there endure 125 after the touch whose power had braided such grace was in some sad change faded <\s>
<s> she looked the flames were dim the flood grew tranquil as a woodland river winding through hills in solitude 130 those marble shapes then seemed to quiver and their fair limbs to float in motion like weeds unfolding in the ocean <\s>
<s> and their lips moved one seemed to speak when suddenly the mountains cracked 135 and through the chasm the flood did break with an earth uplifting cataract the statues gave a joyous scream and on its wings the pale thin dream lifted the lady from the stream <\s>

<s> a pale dream came to a lady fair and said a boon a boon i pray <\s>
<s> i know the secrets of the air and things are lost in the glare of day which i can make the sleeping see 5 if they will put their trust in me <\s>
<s> and thou shalt know of things unknown if thou wilt let me rest between the veiny lids whose fringe is thrown over thine eyes so dark and sheen 10 and half in hope and half in fright the lady closed her eyes so bright <\s>
<s> at first all deadly shapes were driven tumultuously across her sleep and o'er the vast cope of bending heaven 15 all ghastly visaged clouds did sweep and the lady ever looked to spy if the golden sun shone forth on high <\s>
<s> and as towards the east she turned she saw aloft in the morning air 20 which now with hues of sunrise burned a great black anchor rising there and wherever the lady turned her eyes it hung before her in the skies <\s>
<s> the sky was blue as the summer sea 25 the depths were cloudless overhead the air was calm as it could be there was no sight or sound of dread but that black anchor floating still over the piny eastern hill <\s>
<s> the lady grew sick with a weight of fear to see that anchor ever hanging and veiled her eyes she then did hear the sound as of a dim low clanging and looked abroad if she might know 35 was it aught else or but the flow of the blood in her own veins to and fro <\s>
<s> there was a mist in the sunless air which shook as it were with an earthquake's shock but the very weeds that blossomed there 40 were moveless and each mighty rock stood on its basis steadfastly the anchor was seen no more on high <\s>
<s> but piled around with summits hid in lines of cloud at intervals 45 stood many a mountain pyramid among whose everlasting walls two mighty cities shone and ever through the red mist their domes did quiver <\s>
<s> on two dread mountains from whose crest 50 might seem the eagle for her brood would ne'er have hung her dizzy nest those tower encircled cities stood <\s>

<s> and columns framed of marble white and giant fanes dome over dome piled and triumphant gates all bright with workmanship which could not come 60 from touch of mortal instrument shot o'er the vales or lustre lent from its own shapes magnificent <\s>
<s> but still the lady heard that clang filling the wide air far away 65 and still the mist whose light did hang among the mountains shook alway so that the lady's heart beat fast as half in joy and half aghast on those high domes her look she cast <\s>
<s> sudden from out that city sprung a light that made the earth grow red two flames that each with quivering tongue licked its high domes and overhead among those mighty towers and fanes 75 dropped fire as a volcano rains its sulphurous ruin on the plains <\s>
<s> a rush as if the deep had burst its bonds she looked behind and saw over the western steep 80 a raging flood descend and wind through that wide vale she felt no fear but said within herself tis clear these towers are nature's own and she to save them has sent forth the sea <\s>
<s> and now those raging billows came where that fair lady sate and she was borne towards the showering flame by the wild waves heaped tumultuously <\s>
<s> and on a little plank the flow 90 of the whirlpool bore her to and fro <\s>
<s> the flames were fiercely vomited from every tower and every dome and dreary light did widely shed o'er that vast flood's suspended foam 95 beneath the smoke which hung its night on the stained cope of heaven's light <\s>

<s> the eddy whirled her round and round 110 before a gorgeous gate which stood piercing the clouds of smoke which bound its aery arch with light like blood she looked on that gate of marble clear with wonder that extinguished fear <\s>
<s> for it was filled with sculptures rarest of forms most beautiful and strange like nothing human but the fairest of winged shapes whose legions range throughout the sleep of those that are 120 like this same lady good and fair <\s>
<s> and as she looked still lovelier grew those marble forms the sculptor sure was a strong spirit and the hue of his own mind did there endure 125 after the touch whose power had braided such grace was in some sad change faded <\s>
<s> she looked the flames were dim the flood grew tranquil as a woodland river winding through hills in solitude 130 those marble shapes then seemed to quiver and their fair limbs to float in motion like weeds unfolding in the ocean <\s>
<s> and their lips moved one seemed to speak when suddenly the mountains cracked 135 and through the chasm the flood did break with an earth uplifting cataract the statues gave a joyous scream and on its wings the pale thin dream lifted the lady from the stream <\s>

<s> shelley makes the following mention of this poem in his publication of the history of a six weeks tour and letters from switzerland the poem entitled mont blanc is written by the author of the two letters from chamouni and vevai <\s>

<s> there was a mist in the sunless air which shook as it were with an earthquake's shock but the very weeds that blossomed there 40 were moveless and each mighty rock stood on its basis steadfastly the anchor was seen no more on high <\s>

<s> note on poems of 1816 by mrs <\s>
<s> shelley wrote little during this year <\s>
<s> the poem entitled the sunset was written in the spring of the year while still residing at bishopsgate <\s>
<s> he spent the summer on the shores of the lake of geneva <\s>
<s> the hymn to intellectual beauty was conceived during his voyage round the lake with lord byron <\s>
<s> he occupied himself during this voyage by reading the nouvelle heloise for the first time <\s>
<s> the reading it on the very spot where the scenes are laid added to the interest and he was at once surprised and charmed by the passionate eloquence and earnest enthralling interest that pervade this work <\s>
<s> there was something in the character of saint preux in his abnegation of self and in the worship he paid to love that coincided with shelley's own disposition and though differing in many of the views and shocked by others yet the effect of the whole was fascinating and delightful <\s>
<s> mont blanc was inspired by a view of that mountain and its surrounding peaks and valleys as he lingered on the bridge of arve on his way through the valley of chamouni <\s>
<s> shelley makes the following mention of this poem in his publication of the history of a six weeks tour and letters from switzerland the poem entitled mont blanc is written by the author of the two letters from chamouni and vevai <\s>
<s> it was composed under the immediate impression of the deep and powerful feelings excited by the objects which it attempts to describe and as an undisciplined overflowing of the soul rests its claim to approbation on an attempt to imitate the untamable wildness and inaccessible solemnity from which those feelings sprang <\s>
<s> this was an eventful year and less time was given to study than usual <\s>
<s> in the list of his reading i find in greek theocritus the prometheus of aeschylus several of plutarch's lives and the works of lucian <\s>
<s> in latin lucretius pliny's letters the annals and germany of tacitus <\s>
<s> in french the history of the french revolution by lacretelle <\s>

<s> a pale dream came to a lady fair and said a boon a boon i pray <\s>
<s> i know the secrets of the air and things are lost in the glare of day which i can make the sleeping see 5 if they will put their trust in me <\s>
<s> and thou shalt know of things unknown if thou wilt let me rest between the veiny lids whose fringe is thrown over thine eyes so dark and sheen 10 and half in hope and half in fright the lady closed her eyes so bright <\s>
<s> at first all deadly shapes were driven tumultuously across her sleep and o'er the vast cope of bending heaven 15 all ghastly visaged clouds did sweep and the lady ever looked to spy if the golden sun shone forth on high <\s>
<s> and as towards the east she turned she saw aloft in the morning air 20 which now with hues of sunrise burned a great black anchor rising there and wherever the lady turned her eyes it hung before her in the skies <\s>
<s> the sky was blue as the summer sea 25 the depths were cloudless overhead the air was calm as it could be there was no sight or sound of dread but that black anchor floating still over the piny eastern hill <\s>
<s> the lady grew sick with a weight of fear to see that anchor ever hanging and veiled her eyes she then did hear the sound as of a dim low clanging and looked abroad if she might know 35 was it aught else or but the flow of the blood in her own veins to and fro <\s>
<s> there was a mist in the sunless air which shook as it were with an earthquake's shock but the very weeds that blossomed there 40 were moveless and each mighty rock stood on its basis steadfastly the anchor was seen no more on high <\s>
<s> but piled around with summits hid in lines of cloud at intervals 45 stood many a mountain pyramid among whose everlasting walls two mighty cities shone and ever through the red mist their domes did quiver <\s>
<s> on two dread mountains from whose crest 50 might seem the eagle for her brood would ne'er have hung her dizzy nest those tower encircled cities stood <\s>
<s> a vision strange such towers to see sculptured and wrought so gorgeously 55 where human art could never be <\s>
<s> and columns framed of marble white and giant fanes dome over dome piled and triumphant gates all bright with workmanship which could not come 60 from touch of mortal instrument shot o'er the vales or lustre lent from its own shapes magnificent <\s>
<s> but still the lady heard that clang filling the wide air far away 65 and still the mist whose light did hang among the mountains shook alway so that the lady's heart beat fast as half in joy and half aghast on those high domes her look she cast <\s>
<s> sudden from out that city sprung a light that made the earth grow red two flames that each with quivering tongue licked its high domes and overhead among those mighty towers and fanes 75 dropped fire as a volcano rains its sulphurous ruin on the plains <\s>
<s> a rush as if the deep had burst its bonds she looked behind and saw over the western steep 80 a raging flood descend and wind through that wide vale she felt no fear but said within herself tis clear these towers are nature's own and she to save them has sent forth the sea <\s>
<s> and now those raging billows came where that fair lady sate and she was borne towards the showering flame by the wild waves heaped tumultuously <\s>
<s> and on a little plank the flow 90 of the whirlpool bore her to and fro <\s>
<s> the flames were fiercely vomited from every tower and every dome and dreary light did widely shed o'er that vast flood's suspended foam 95 beneath the smoke which hung its night on the stained cope of heaven's light <\s>
<s> the plank whereon that lady sate was driven through the chasms about and about between the peaks so desolate 100 of the drowning mountains in and out as the thistle beard on a whirlwind sails while the flood was filling those hollow vales <\s>
<s> at last her plank an eddy crossed and bore her to the city's wall 105 which now the flood had reached almost it might the stoutest heart appal to hear the fire roar and hiss through the domes of those mighty palaces <\s>
<s> the eddy whirled her round and round 110 before a gorgeous gate which stood piercing the clouds of smoke which bound its aery arch with light like blood she looked on that gate of marble clear with wonder that extinguished fear <\s>
<s> for it was filled with sculptures rarest of forms most beautiful and strange like nothing human but the fairest of winged shapes whose legions range throughout the sleep of those that are 120 like this same lady good and fair <\s>
<s> and as she looked still lovelier grew those marble forms the sculptor sure was a strong spirit and the hue of his own mind did there endure 125 after the touch whose power had braided such grace was in some sad change faded <\s>
<s> she looked the flames were dim the flood grew tranquil as a woodland river winding through hills in solitude 130 those marble shapes then seemed to quiver and their fair limbs to float in motion like weeds unfolding in the ocean <\s>
<s> and their lips moved one seemed to speak when suddenly the mountains cracked 135 and through the chasm the flood did break with an earth uplifting cataract the statues gave a joyous scream and on its wings the pale thin dream lifted the lady from the stream <\s>
<s> the dizzy flight of that phantom pale waked the fair lady from her sleep and she arose while from the veil of her dark eyes the dream did creep and she walked about as one who knew 145 that sleep has sights as clear and true as any waking eyes can view <\s>

<s> a pale dream came to a lady fair and said a boon a boon i pray <\s>
<s> i know the secrets of the air and things are lost in the glare of day which i can make the sleeping see 5 if they will put their trust in me <\s>
<s> and thou shalt know of things unknown if thou wilt let me rest between the veiny lids whose fringe is thrown over thine eyes so dark and sheen 10 and half in hope and half in fright the lady closed her eyes so bright <\s>
<s> at first all deadly shapes were driven tumultuously across her sleep and o'er the vast cope of bending heaven 15 all ghastly visaged clouds did sweep and the lady ever looked to spy if the golden sun shone forth on high <\s>
<s> and as towards the east she turned she saw aloft in the morning air 20 which now with hues of sunrise burned a great black anchor rising there and wherever the lady turned her eyes it hung before her in the skies <\s>
<s> the sky was blue as the summer sea 25 the depths were cloudless overhead the air was calm as it could be there was no sight or sound of dread but that black anchor floating still over the piny eastern hill <\s>
<s> the lady grew sick with a weight of fear to see that anchor ever hanging and veiled her eyes she then did hear the sound as of a dim low clanging and looked abroad if she might know 35 was it aught else or but the flow of the blood in her own veins to and fro <\s>
<s> there was a mist in the sunless air which shook as it were with an earthquake's shock but the very weeds that blossomed there 40 were moveless and each mighty rock stood on its basis steadfastly the anchor was seen no more on high <\s>
<s> but piled around with summits hid in lines of cloud at intervals 45 stood many a mountain pyramid among whose everlasting walls two mighty cities shone and ever through the red mist their domes did quiver <\s>
<s> on two dread mountains from whose crest 50 might seem the eagle for her brood would ne'er have hung her dizzy nest those tower encircled cities stood <\s>
<s> a vision strange such towers to see sculptured and wrought so gorgeously 55 where human art could never be <\s>
<s> and columns framed of marble white and giant fanes dome over dome piled and triumphant gates all bright with workmanship which could not come 60 from touch of mortal instrument shot o'er the vales or lustre lent from its own shapes magnificent <\s>
<s> but still the lady heard that clang filling the wide air far away 65 and still the mist whose light did hang among the mountains shook alway so that the lady's heart beat fast as half in joy and half aghast on those high domes her look she cast <\s>
<s> sudden from out that city sprung a light that made the earth grow red two flames that each with quivering tongue licked its high domes and overhead among those mighty towers and fanes 75 dropped fire as a volcano rains its sulphurous ruin on the plains <\s>
<s> a rush as if the deep had burst its bonds she looked behind and saw over the western steep 80 a raging flood descend and wind through that wide vale she felt no fear but said within herself tis clear these towers are nature's own and she to save them has sent forth the sea <\s>
<s> and now those raging billows came where that fair lady sate and she was borne towards the showering flame by the wild waves heaped tumultuously <\s>
<s> and on a little plank the flow 90 of the whirlpool bore her to and fro <\s>
<s> the flames were fiercely vomited from every tower and every dome and dreary light did widely shed o'er that vast flood's suspended foam 95 beneath the smoke which hung its night on the stained cope of heaven's light <\s>
<s> the plank whereon that lady sate was driven through the chasms about and about between the peaks so desolate 100 of the drowning mountains in and out as the thistle beard on a whirlwind sails while the flood was filling those hollow vales <\s>
<s> at last her plank an eddy crossed and bore her to the city's wall 105 which now the flood had reached almost it might the stoutest heart appal to hear the fire roar and hiss through the domes of those mighty palaces <\s>
<s> the eddy whirled her round and round 110 before a gorgeous gate which stood piercing the clouds of smoke which bound its aery arch with light like blood she looked on that gate of marble clear with wonder that extinguished fear <\s>
<s> for it was filled with sculptures rarest of forms most beautiful and strange like nothing human but the fairest of winged shapes whose legions range throughout the sleep of those that are 120 like this same lady good and fair <\s>
<s> and as she looked still lovelier grew those marble forms the sculptor sure was a strong spirit and the hue of his own mind did there endure 125 after the touch whose power had braided such grace was in some sad change faded <\s>
<s> she looked the flames were dim the flood grew tranquil as a woodland river winding through hills in solitude 130 those marble shapes then seemed to quiver and their fair limbs to float in motion like weeds unfolding in the ocean <\s>
<s> and their lips moved one seemed to speak when suddenly the mountains cracked 135 and through the chasm the flood did break with an earth uplifting cataract the statues gave a joyous scream and on its wings the pale thin dream lifted the lady from the stream <\s>

<s> a pale dream came to a lady fair and said a boon a boon i pray <\s>
<s> i know the secrets of the air and things are lost in the glare of day which i can make the sleeping see 5 if they will put their trust in me <\s>
<s> and thou shalt know of things unknown if thou wilt let me rest between the veiny lids whose fringe is thrown over thine eyes so dark and sheen 10 and half in hope and half in fright the lady closed her eyes so bright <\s>
<s> at first all deadly shapes were driven tumultuously across her sleep and o'er the vast cope of bending heaven 15 all ghastly visaged clouds did sweep and the lady ever looked to spy if the golden sun shone forth on high <\s>
<s> and as towards the east she turned she saw aloft in the morning air 20 which now with hues of sunrise burned a great black anchor rising there and wherever the lady turned her eyes it hung before her in the skies <\s>
<s> the sky was blue as the summer sea 25 the depths were cloudless overhead the air was calm as it could be there was no sight or sound of dread but that black anchor floating still over the piny eastern hill <\s>
<s> the lady grew sick with a weight of fear to see that anchor ever hanging and veiled her eyes she then did hear the sound as of a dim low clanging and looked abroad if she might know 35 was it aught else or but the flow of the blood in her own veins to and fro <\s>
<s> there was a mist in the sunless air which shook as it were with an earthquake's shock but the very weeds that blossomed there 40 were moveless and each mighty rock stood on its basis steadfastly the anchor was seen no more on high <\s>
<s> but piled around with summits hid in lines of cloud at intervals 45 stood many a mountain pyramid among whose everlasting walls two mighty cities shone and ever through the red mist their domes did quiver <\s>
<s> on two dread mountains from whose crest 50 might seem the eagle for her brood would ne'er have hung her dizzy nest those tower encircled cities stood <\s>
<s> a vision strange such towers to see sculptured and wrought so gorgeously 55 where human art could never be <\s>
<s> and columns framed of marble white and giant fanes dome over dome piled and triumphant gates all bright with workmanship which could not come 60 from touch of mortal instrument shot o'er the vales or lustre lent from its own shapes magnificent <\s>
<s> but still the lady heard that clang filling the wide air far away 65 and still the mist whose light did hang among the mountains shook alway so that the lady's heart beat fast as half in joy and half aghast on those high domes her look she cast <\s>
<s> sudden from out that city sprung a light that made the earth grow red two flames that each with quivering tongue licked its high domes and overhead among those mighty towers and fanes 75 dropped fire as a volcano rains its sulphurous ruin on the plains <\s>
<s> a rush as if the deep had burst its bonds she looked behind and saw over the western steep 80 a raging flood descend and wind through that wide vale she felt no fear but said within herself tis clear these towers are nature's own and she to save them has sent forth the sea <\s>
<s> and now those raging billows came where that fair lady sate and she was borne towards the showering flame by the wild waves heaped tumultuously <\s>
<s> and on a little plank the flow 90 of the whirlpool bore her to and fro <\s>
<s> the flames were fiercely vomited from every tower and every dome and dreary light did widely shed o'er that vast flood's suspended foam 95 beneath the smoke which hung its night on the stained cope of heaven's light <\s>

<s> the eddy whirled her round and round 110 before a gorgeous gate which stood piercing the clouds of smoke which bound its aery arch with light like blood she looked on that gate of marble clear with wonder that extinguished fear <\s>
<s> for it was filled with sculptures rarest of forms most beautiful and strange like nothing human but the fairest of winged shapes whose legions range throughout the sleep of those that are 120 like this same lady good and fair <\s>
<s> and as she looked still lovelier grew those marble forms the sculptor sure was a strong spirit and the hue of his own mind did there endure 125 after the touch whose power had braided such grace was in some sad change faded <\s>
<s> she looked the flames were dim the flood grew tranquil as a woodland river winding through hills in solitude 130 those marble shapes then seemed to quiver and their fair limbs to float in motion like weeds unfolding in the ocean <\s>
<s> and their lips moved one seemed to speak when suddenly the mountains cracked 135 and through the chasm the flood did break with an earth uplifting cataract the statues gave a joyous scream and on its wings the pale thin dream lifted the lady from the stream <\s>

<s> note on poems of 1816 by mrs <\s>
<s> shelley wrote little during this year <\s>
<s> the poem entitled the sunset was written in the spring of the year while still residing at bishopsgate <\s>
<s> he spent the summer on the shores of the lake of geneva <\s>
<s> the hymn to intellectual beauty was conceived during his voyage round the lake with lord byron <\s>
<s> he occupied himself during this voyage by reading the nouvelle heloise for the first time <\s>
<s> the reading it on the very spot where the scenes are laid added to the interest and he was at once surprised and charmed by the passionate eloquence and earnest enthralling interest that pervade this work <\s>
<s> there was something in the character of saint preux in his abnegation of self and in the worship he paid to love that coincided with shelley's own disposition and though differing in many of the views and shocked by others yet the effect of the whole was fascinating and delightful <\s>
<s> mont blanc was inspired by a view of that mountain and its surrounding peaks and valleys as he lingered on the bridge of arve on his way through the valley of chamouni <\s>
<s> shelley makes the following mention of this poem in his publication of the history of a six weeks tour and letters from switzerland the poem entitled mont blanc is written by the author of the two letters from chamouni and vevai <\s>
<s> it was composed under the immediate impression of the deep and powerful feelings excited by the objects which it attempts to describe and as an undisciplined overflowing of the soul rests its claim to approbation on an attempt to imitate the untamable wildness and inaccessible solemnity from which those feelings sprang <\s>
<s> this was an eventful year and less time was given to study than usual <\s>
<s> in the list of his reading i find in greek theocritus the prometheus of aeschylus several of plutarch's lives and the works of lucian <\s>
<s> in latin lucretius pliny's letters the annals and germany of tacitus <\s>
<s> in french the history of the french revolution by lacretelle <\s>
<s> he read for the first time this year montaigne's essays and regarded them ever after as one of the most delightful and instructive books in the world <\s>
<s> the list is scanty in english works locke's essay political justice and coleridge's lay sermon form nearly the whole <\s>
<s> it was his frequent habit to read aloud to me in the evening in this way we read this year the new testament paradise lost spenser's faery queen and don quixote <\s>
<s> poems written in 1817 <\s>
<s> composed at marlow 1817 <\s>
<s> published in hunt's literary pocket book 1819 and reprinted in posthumous poems 1824 1 <\s>
<s> a pale dream came to a lady fair and said a boon a boon i pray <\s>
<s> i know the secrets of the air and things are lost in the glare of day which i can make the sleeping see 5 if they will put their trust in me <\s>
<s> and thou shalt know of things unknown if thou wilt let me rest between the veiny lids whose fringe is thrown over thine eyes so dark and sheen 10 and half in hope and half in fright the lady closed her eyes so bright <\s>
<s> at first all deadly shapes were driven tumultuously across her sleep and o'er the vast cope of bending heaven 15 all ghastly visaged clouds did sweep and the lady ever looked to spy if the golden sun shone forth on high <\s>
<s> and as towards the east she turned she saw aloft in the morning air 20 which now with hues of sunrise burned a great black anchor rising there and wherever the lady turned her eyes it hung before her in the skies <\s>
<s> the sky was blue as the summer sea 25 the depths were cloudless overhead the air was calm as it could be there was no sight or sound of dread but that black anchor floating still over the piny eastern hill <\s>
<s> the lady grew sick with a weight of fear to see that anchor ever hanging and veiled her eyes she then did hear the sound as of a dim low clanging and looked abroad if she might know 35 was it aught else or but the flow of the blood in her own veins to and fro <\s>
<s> there was a mist in the sunless air which shook as it were with an earthquake's shock but the very weeds that blossomed there 40 were moveless and each mighty rock stood on its basis steadfastly the anchor was seen no more on high <\s>
<s> but piled around with summits hid in lines of cloud at intervals 45 stood many a mountain pyramid among whose everlasting walls two mighty cities shone and ever through the red mist their domes did quiver <\s>
<s> on two dread mountains from whose crest 50 might seem the eagle for her brood would ne'er have hung her dizzy nest those tower encircled cities stood <\s>
<s> a vision strange such towers to see sculptured and wrought so gorgeously 55 where human art could never be <\s>
<s> and columns framed of marble white and giant fanes dome over dome piled and triumphant gates all bright with workmanship which could not come 60 from touch of mortal instrument shot o'er the vales or lustre lent from its own shapes magnificent <\s>
<s> but still the lady heard that clang filling the wide air far away 65 and still the mist whose light did hang among the mountains shook alway so that the lady's heart beat fast as half in joy and half aghast on those high domes her look she cast <\s>
<s> sudden from out that city sprung a light that made the earth grow red two flames that each with quivering tongue licked its high domes and overhead among those mighty towers and fanes 75 dropped fire as a volcano rains its sulphurous ruin on the plains <\s>
<s> a rush as if the deep had burst its bonds she looked behind and saw over the western steep 80 a raging flood descend and wind through that wide vale she felt no fear but said within herself tis clear these towers are nature's own and she to save them has sent forth the sea <\s>
<s> and now those raging billows came where that fair lady sate and she was borne towards the showering flame by the wild waves heaped tumultuously <\s>
<s> and on a little plank the flow 90 of the whirlpool bore her to and fro <\s>
<s> the flames were fiercely vomited from every tower and every dome and dreary light did widely shed o'er that vast flood's suspended foam 95 beneath the smoke which hung its night on the stained cope of heaven's light <\s>
<s> the plank whereon that lady sate was driven through the chasms about and about between the peaks so desolate 100 of the drowning mountains in and out as the thistle beard on a whirlwind sails while the flood was filling those hollow vales <\s>
<s> at last her plank an eddy crossed and bore her to the city's wall 105 which now the flood had reached almost it might the stoutest heart appal to hear the fire roar and hiss through the domes of those mighty palaces <\s>
<s> the eddy whirled her round and round 110 before a gorgeous gate which stood piercing the clouds of smoke which bound its aery arch with light like blood she looked on that gate of marble clear with wonder that extinguished fear <\s>
<s> for it was filled with sculptures rarest of forms most beautiful and strange like nothing human but the fairest of winged shapes whose legions range throughout the sleep of those that are 120 like this same lady good and fair <\s>
<s> and as she looked still lovelier grew those marble forms the sculptor sure was a strong spirit and the hue of his own mind did there endure 125 after the touch whose power had braided such grace was in some sad change faded <\s>
<s> she looked the flames were dim the flood grew tranquil as a woodland river winding through hills in solitude 130 those marble shapes then seemed to quiver and their fair limbs to float in motion like weeds unfolding in the ocean <\s>
<s> and their lips moved one seemed to speak when suddenly the mountains cracked 135 and through the chasm the flood did break with an earth uplifting cataract the statues gave a joyous scream and on its wings the pale thin dream lifted the lady from the stream <\s>

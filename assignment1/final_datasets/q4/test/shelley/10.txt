<s> its hair is white the brightness of white light scattered in strings yet its two eyes are heavens 225 of liquid darkness which the deity within seems pouring as a storm is poured from jagged clouds out of their arrowy lashes tempering the cold and radiant air around with fire that is not brightness in its hand 230 it sways a quivering moonbeam from whose point a guiding power directs the chariot's prow over its wheeled clouds which as they roll over the grass and flowers and waves wake sounds sweet as a singing rain of silver dew <\s>

<s> with mighty whirl the multitudinous orb grinds the bright brook into an azure mist of elemental subtlety like light 255 and the wild odour of the forest flowers the music of the living grass and air the emerald light of leaf entangled beams round its intense yet self conflicting speed seem kneaded into one aereal mass 260 which drowns the sense <\s>
<s> within the orb itself pillowed upon its alabaster arms like to a child o'erwearied with sweet toil on its own folded wings and wavy hair the spirit of the earth is laid asleep 265 and you can see its little lips are moving amid the changing light of their own smiles like one who talks of what he loves in dream <\s>

<s> even those who may dissent from his opinions will consider that he was a man of genius and that the world will take more interest in his slightest word than in the waters of lethe which are so eagerly prescribed as medicinal for all its wrongs and woe <\s>

<s> it is a mere plaything of the imagination which even may not excite smiles among many who will not see wit in those combinations of thought which were full of the ridiculous to the author <\s>

<s> these circumstances were the theme of all conversation among the english <\s>
<s> we were then at the baths of san giuliano <\s>
<s> a friend came to visit us on the day when a fair was held in the square beneath our windows shelley read to us his ode to liberty and was riotously accompanied by the grunting of a quantity of pigs brought for sale to the fair <\s>

<s> the world has a right to the entire compositions of such a man for it does not live and thrive by the outworn lesson of the dullard or the hypocrite but by the original free thoughts of men of genius who aspire to pluck bright truth from the pale faced moon or dive into the bottom of the deep where fathom line would never touch the ground and pluck up drowned truth <\s>
<s> even those who may dissent from his opinions will consider that he was a man of genius and that the world will take more interest in his slightest word than in the waters of lethe which are so eagerly prescribed as medicinal for all its wrongs and woe <\s>
<s> this drama however must not be judged for more than was meant <\s>
<s> it is a mere plaything of the imagination which even may not excite smiles among many who will not see wit in those combinations of thought which were full of the ridiculous to the author <\s>

<s> this was the period of queen caroline's landing in england and the struggles made by george iv to get rid of her claims which failing lord castlereagh placed the green bag on the table of the house of commons demanding in the king's name that an enquiry should be instituted into his wife's conduct <\s>
<s> these circumstances were the theme of all conversation among the english <\s>
<s> we were then at the baths of san giuliano <\s>
<s> a friend came to visit us on the day when a fair was held in the square beneath our windows shelley read to us his ode to liberty and was riotously accompanied by the grunting of a quantity of pigs brought for sale to the fair <\s>
<s> he compared it to the chorus of frogs in the satiric drama of aristophanes and it being an hour of merriment and one ludicrous association suggesting another he imagined a political satirical drama on the circumstances of the day to which the pigs would serve as chorus and swellfoot was begun <\s>
<s> when finished it was transmitted to england printed and published anonymously but stifled at the very dawn of its existence by the society for the suppression of vice who threatened to prosecute it if not immediately withdrawn <\s>
<s> the friend who had taken the trouble of bringing it out of course did not think it worth the annoyance and expense of a contest and it was laid aside <\s>
<s> hesitation of whether it would do honour to shelley prevented my publishing it at first <\s>

<s> the world has a right to the entire compositions of such a man for it does not live and thrive by the outworn lesson of the dullard or the hypocrite but by the original free thoughts of men of genius who aspire to pluck bright truth from the pale faced moon or dive into the bottom of the deep where fathom line would never touch the ground and pluck up drowned truth <\s>
<s> even those who may dissent from his opinions will consider that he was a man of genius and that the world will take more interest in his slightest word than in the waters of lethe which are so eagerly prescribed as medicinal for all its wrongs and woe <\s>
<s> this drama however must not be judged for more than was meant <\s>
<s> it is a mere plaything of the imagination which even may not excite smiles among many who will not see wit in those combinations of thought which were full of the ridiculous to the author <\s>
<s> but like everything he wrote it breathes that deep sympathy for the sorrows of humanity and indignation against its oppressors which make it worthy of his name <\s>

<s> even those who may dissent from his opinions will consider that he was a man of genius and that the world will take more interest in his slightest word than in the waters of lethe which are so eagerly prescribed as medicinal for all its wrongs and woe <\s>

<s> it is a mere plaything of the imagination which even may not excite smiles among many who will not see wit in those combinations of thought which were full of the ridiculous to the author <\s>

<s> these circumstances were the theme of all conversation among the english <\s>
<s> we were then at the baths of san giuliano <\s>
<s> a friend came to visit us on the day when a fair was held in the square beneath our windows shelley read to us his ode to liberty and was riotously accompanied by the grunting of a quantity of pigs brought for sale to the fair <\s>

<s> the world has a right to the entire compositions of such a man for it does not live and thrive by the outworn lesson of the dullard or the hypocrite but by the original free thoughts of men of genius who aspire to pluck bright truth from the pale faced moon or dive into the bottom of the deep where fathom line would never touch the ground and pluck up drowned truth <\s>
<s> even those who may dissent from his opinions will consider that he was a man of genius and that the world will take more interest in his slightest word than in the waters of lethe which are so eagerly prescribed as medicinal for all its wrongs and woe <\s>
<s> this drama however must not be judged for more than was meant <\s>
<s> it is a mere plaything of the imagination which even may not excite smiles among many who will not see wit in those combinations of thought which were full of the ridiculous to the author <\s>

<s> this was the period of queen caroline's landing in england and the struggles made by george iv to get rid of her claims which failing lord castlereagh placed the green bag on the table of the house of commons demanding in the king's name that an enquiry should be instituted into his wife's conduct <\s>
<s> these circumstances were the theme of all conversation among the english <\s>
<s> we were then at the baths of san giuliano <\s>
<s> a friend came to visit us on the day when a fair was held in the square beneath our windows shelley read to us his ode to liberty and was riotously accompanied by the grunting of a quantity of pigs brought for sale to the fair <\s>
<s> he compared it to the chorus of frogs in the satiric drama of aristophanes and it being an hour of merriment and one ludicrous association suggesting another he imagined a political satirical drama on the circumstances of the day to which the pigs would serve as chorus and swellfoot was begun <\s>
<s> when finished it was transmitted to england printed and published anonymously but stifled at the very dawn of its existence by the society for the suppression of vice who threatened to prosecute it if not immediately withdrawn <\s>
<s> the friend who had taken the trouble of bringing it out of course did not think it worth the annoyance and expense of a contest and it was laid aside <\s>
<s> hesitation of whether it would do honour to shelley prevented my publishing it at first <\s>

<s> the world has a right to the entire compositions of such a man for it does not live and thrive by the outworn lesson of the dullard or the hypocrite but by the original free thoughts of men of genius who aspire to pluck bright truth from the pale faced moon or dive into the bottom of the deep where fathom line would never touch the ground and pluck up drowned truth <\s>
<s> even those who may dissent from his opinions will consider that he was a man of genius and that the world will take more interest in his slightest word than in the waters of lethe which are so eagerly prescribed as medicinal for all its wrongs and woe <\s>
<s> this drama however must not be judged for more than was meant <\s>
<s> it is a mere plaything of the imagination which even may not excite smiles among many who will not see wit in those combinations of thought which were full of the ridiculous to the author <\s>
<s> but like everything he wrote it breathes that deep sympathy for the sorrows of humanity and indignation against its oppressors which make it worthy of his name <\s>

<s> even those who may dissent from his opinions will consider that he was a man of genius and that the world will take more interest in his slightest word than in the waters of lethe which are so eagerly prescribed as medicinal for all its wrongs and woe <\s>

<s> it is a mere plaything of the imagination which even may not excite smiles among many who will not see wit in those combinations of thought which were full of the ridiculous to the author <\s>

<s> these circumstances were the theme of all conversation among the english <\s>
<s> we were then at the baths of san giuliano <\s>
<s> a friend came to visit us on the day when a fair was held in the square beneath our windows shelley read to us his ode to liberty and was riotously accompanied by the grunting of a quantity of pigs brought for sale to the fair <\s>

<s> the world has a right to the entire compositions of such a man for it does not live and thrive by the outworn lesson of the dullard or the hypocrite but by the original free thoughts of men of genius who aspire to pluck bright truth from the pale faced moon or dive into the bottom of the deep where fathom line would never touch the ground and pluck up drowned truth <\s>
<s> even those who may dissent from his opinions will consider that he was a man of genius and that the world will take more interest in his slightest word than in the waters of lethe which are so eagerly prescribed as medicinal for all its wrongs and woe <\s>
<s> this drama however must not be judged for more than was meant <\s>
<s> it is a mere plaything of the imagination which even may not excite smiles among many who will not see wit in those combinations of thought which were full of the ridiculous to the author <\s>

<s> this was the period of queen caroline's landing in england and the struggles made by george iv to get rid of her claims which failing lord castlereagh placed the green bag on the table of the house of commons demanding in the king's name that an enquiry should be instituted into his wife's conduct <\s>
<s> these circumstances were the theme of all conversation among the english <\s>
<s> we were then at the baths of san giuliano <\s>
<s> a friend came to visit us on the day when a fair was held in the square beneath our windows shelley read to us his ode to liberty and was riotously accompanied by the grunting of a quantity of pigs brought for sale to the fair <\s>
<s> he compared it to the chorus of frogs in the satiric drama of aristophanes and it being an hour of merriment and one ludicrous association suggesting another he imagined a political satirical drama on the circumstances of the day to which the pigs would serve as chorus and swellfoot was begun <\s>
<s> when finished it was transmitted to england printed and published anonymously but stifled at the very dawn of its existence by the society for the suppression of vice who threatened to prosecute it if not immediately withdrawn <\s>
<s> the friend who had taken the trouble of bringing it out of course did not think it worth the annoyance and expense of a contest and it was laid aside <\s>
<s> hesitation of whether it would do honour to shelley prevented my publishing it at first <\s>
<s> but i cannot bring myself to keep back anything he ever wrote for each word is fraught with the peculiar views and sentiments which he believed to be beneficial to the human race and the bright light of poetry irradiates every thought <\s>
<s> the world has a right to the entire compositions of such a man for it does not live and thrive by the outworn lesson of the dullard or the hypocrite but by the original free thoughts of men of genius who aspire to pluck bright truth from the pale faced moon or dive into the bottom of the deep where fathom line would never touch the ground and pluck up drowned truth <\s>
<s> even those who may dissent from his opinions will consider that he was a man of genius and that the world will take more interest in his slightest word than in the waters of lethe which are so eagerly prescribed as medicinal for all its wrongs and woe <\s>
<s> this drama however must not be judged for more than was meant <\s>
<s> it is a mere plaything of the imagination which even may not excite smiles among many who will not see wit in those combinations of thought which were full of the ridiculous to the author <\s>
<s> but like everything he wrote it breathes that deep sympathy for the sorrows of humanity and indignation against its oppressors which make it worthy of his name <\s>

<s> the writer of the following lines died at florence as he was preparing for a voyage to one of the wildest of the sporades which he had bought and where he had fitted up the ruins of an old building and where it was his hope to have realised a scheme of life suited perhaps to that happier and better world of which he is now an inhabitant but hardly practicable in this <\s>

<s> the present poem like the vita nuova of dante is sufficiently intelligible to a certain class of readers without a matter of fact history of the circumstances to which it relates and to a certain other class it must ever remain incomprehensible from a defect of a common organ of perception for the ideas of which it treats <\s>

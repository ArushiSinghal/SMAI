<s> i'll tell thee truth <\s>
<s> he was a man hard selfish loving only gold yet full of guile his pale eyes ran 250 with tears which each some falsehood told and oft his smooth and bridled tongue would give the lie to his flushing cheek he was a coward to the strong he was a tyrant to the weak 255 on whom his vengeance he would wreak for scorn whose arrows search the heart from many a stranger's eye would dart and on his memory cling and follow his soul to its home so cold and hollow <\s>

<s> when he was in the churchyard lying among the worms we grew quite poor so that no one would give us bread 320 my mother looked at me and said faint words of cheer which only meant that she could die and be content so i went forth from the same church door to another husband's bed <\s>
<s> 325 and this was he who died at last when weeks and months and years had passed through which i firmly did fulfil my duties a devoted wife with the stern step of vanquished will 330 walking beneath the night of life whose hours extinguished like slow rain falling for ever pain by pain the very hope of death's dear rest which since the heart within my breast 335 of natural life was dispossessed its strange sustainer there had been <\s>
<s> when flowers were dead and grass was green upon my mother's grave that mother whom to outlive and cheer and make 340 my wan eyes glitter for her sake was my vowed task the single care which once gave life to my despair when she was a thing that did not stir and the crawling worms were cradling her 345 to a sleep more deep and so more sweet than a baby's rocked on its nurse's knee i lived a living pulse then beat beneath my heart that awakened me <\s>

<s> for long long years 360 these frozen eyes had shed no tears but now 'twas the season fair and mild when april has wept itself to may i sate through the sweet sunny day by my window bowered round with leaves 365 and down my cheeks the quick tears fell like twinkling rain drops from the eaves when warm spring showers are passing o'er <\s>
<s> o helen none can ever tell the joy it was to weep once more <\s>

<s> i'll tell thee truth <\s>

<s> when he was in the churchyard lying among the worms we grew quite poor so that no one would give us bread 320 my mother looked at me and said faint words of cheer which only meant that she could die and be content so i went forth from the same church door to another husband's bed <\s>
<s> 325 and this was he who died at last when weeks and months and years had passed through which i firmly did fulfil my duties a devoted wife with the stern step of vanquished will 330 walking beneath the night of life whose hours extinguished like slow rain falling for ever pain by pain the very hope of death's dear rest which since the heart within my breast 335 of natural life was dispossessed its strange sustainer there had been <\s>
<s> when flowers were dead and grass was green upon my mother's grave that mother whom to outlive and cheer and make 340 my wan eyes glitter for her sake was my vowed task the single care which once gave life to my despair when she was a thing that did not stir and the crawling worms were cradling her 345 to a sleep more deep and so more sweet than a baby's rocked on its nurse's knee i lived a living pulse then beat beneath my heart that awakened me <\s>

<s> for long long years 360 these frozen eyes had shed no tears but now 'twas the season fair and mild when april has wept itself to may i sate through the sweet sunny day by my window bowered round with leaves 365 and down my cheeks the quick tears fell like twinkling rain drops from the eaves when warm spring showers are passing o'er <\s>
<s> o helen none can ever tell the joy it was to weep once more <\s>

<s> and haply i would dream twere sweet to feed it from my faded breast or mark my own heart's restless beat 380 rock it to its untroubled rest and watch the growing soul beneath dawn in faint smiles and hear its breath half interrupted by calm sighs and search the depth of its fair eyes 385 for long departed memories <\s>

<s> then with a laugh both long and wild the youth upon the pavement fell 305 they found him dead <\s>
<s> all looked on me the spasms of my despair to see but i was calm <\s>
<s> i went away i was clammy cold like clay <\s>
<s> i did not weep i did not speak 310 but day by day week after week i walked about like a corpse alive <\s>
<s> sweet friend you must believe this heart is stone it did not break <\s>
<s> my father lived a little while 315 but all might see that he was dying he smiled with such a woeful smile <\s>
<s> when he was in the churchyard lying among the worms we grew quite poor so that no one would give us bread 320 my mother looked at me and said faint words of cheer which only meant that she could die and be content so i went forth from the same church door to another husband's bed <\s>
<s> 325 and this was he who died at last when weeks and months and years had passed through which i firmly did fulfil my duties a devoted wife with the stern step of vanquished will 330 walking beneath the night of life whose hours extinguished like slow rain falling for ever pain by pain the very hope of death's dear rest which since the heart within my breast 335 of natural life was dispossessed its strange sustainer there had been <\s>
<s> when flowers were dead and grass was green upon my mother's grave that mother whom to outlive and cheer and make 340 my wan eyes glitter for her sake was my vowed task the single care which once gave life to my despair when she was a thing that did not stir and the crawling worms were cradling her 345 to a sleep more deep and so more sweet than a baby's rocked on its nurse's knee i lived a living pulse then beat beneath my heart that awakened me <\s>
<s> what was this pulse so warm and free <\s>
<s> i knew it could not be my own dull blood twas like a thought of liquid love that spread and wrought under my bosom and in my brain and crept with the blood through every vein 355 and hour by hour day after day the wonder could not charm away but laid in sleep my wakeful pain until i knew it was a child and then i wept <\s>
<s> for long long years 360 these frozen eyes had shed no tears but now 'twas the season fair and mild when april has wept itself to may i sate through the sweet sunny day by my window bowered round with leaves 365 and down my cheeks the quick tears fell like twinkling rain drops from the eaves when warm spring showers are passing o'er <\s>
<s> o helen none can ever tell the joy it was to weep once more <\s>

<s> and haply i would dream twere sweet to feed it from my faded breast or mark my own heart's restless beat 380 rock it to its untroubled rest and watch the growing soul beneath dawn in faint smiles and hear its breath half interrupted by calm sighs and search the depth of its fair eyes 385 for long departed memories <\s>

<s> i'll tell thee truth <\s>
<s> he was a man hard selfish loving only gold yet full of guile his pale eyes ran 250 with tears which each some falsehood told and oft his smooth and bridled tongue would give the lie to his flushing cheek he was a coward to the strong he was a tyrant to the weak 255 on whom his vengeance he would wreak for scorn whose arrows search the heart from many a stranger's eye would dart and on his memory cling and follow his soul to its home so cold and hollow <\s>

<s> i'll tell thee truth <\s>
<s> he was a man hard selfish loving only gold yet full of guile his pale eyes ran 250 with tears which each some falsehood told and oft his smooth and bridled tongue would give the lie to his flushing cheek he was a coward to the strong he was a tyrant to the weak 255 on whom his vengeance he would wreak for scorn whose arrows search the heart from many a stranger's eye would dart and on his memory cling and follow his soul to its home so cold and hollow <\s>

<s> for long long years 360 these frozen eyes had shed no tears but now 'twas the season fair and mild when april has wept itself to may i sate through the sweet sunny day by my window bowered round with leaves 365 and down my cheeks the quick tears fell like twinkling rain drops from the eaves when warm spring showers are passing o'er <\s>

<s> when he was in the churchyard lying among the worms we grew quite poor so that no one would give us bread 320 my mother looked at me and said faint words of cheer which only meant that she could die and be content so i went forth from the same church door to another husband's bed <\s>
<s> 325 and this was he who died at last when weeks and months and years had passed through which i firmly did fulfil my duties a devoted wife with the stern step of vanquished will 330 walking beneath the night of life whose hours extinguished like slow rain falling for ever pain by pain the very hope of death's dear rest which since the heart within my breast 335 of natural life was dispossessed its strange sustainer there had been <\s>
<s> when flowers were dead and grass was green upon my mother's grave that mother whom to outlive and cheer and make 340 my wan eyes glitter for her sake was my vowed task the single care which once gave life to my despair when she was a thing that did not stir and the crawling worms were cradling her 345 to a sleep more deep and so more sweet than a baby's rocked on its nurse's knee i lived a living pulse then beat beneath my heart that awakened me <\s>

<s> for long long years 360 these frozen eyes had shed no tears but now 'twas the season fair and mild when april has wept itself to may i sate through the sweet sunny day by my window bowered round with leaves 365 and down my cheeks the quick tears fell like twinkling rain drops from the eaves when warm spring showers are passing o'er <\s>
<s> o helen none can ever tell the joy it was to weep once more <\s>

<s> the snake the pale snake that with eager breath creeps here his noontide thirst to slake 115 is beaming with many a mingled hue shed from yon dome's eternal blue when he floats on that dark and lucid flood in the light of his own loveliness and the birds that in the fountain dip 120 their plumes with fearless fellowship above and round him wheel and hover <\s>
<s> the fitful wind is heard to stir one solitary leaf on high the chirping of the grasshopper 125 fills every pause <\s>

<s> the accustomed nightingale still broods on her accustomed bough but she is mute for her false mate has fled and left her desolate <\s>
<s> 145 this silent spot tradition old had peopled with the spectral dead <\s>
<s> for the roots of the speaker's hair felt cold and stiff as with tremulous lips he told that a hellish shape at midnight led 150 the ghost of a youth with hoary hair and sate on the seat beside him there till a naked child came wandering by when the fiend would change to a lady fair <\s>
<s> the truth was worse 155 for here a sister and a brother had solemnized a monstrous curse meeting in this fair solitude for beneath yon very sky had they resigned to one another 160 body and soul <\s>
<s> the multitude tracking them to the secret wood tore limb from limb their innocent child and stabbed and trampled on its mother but the youth for god's most holy grace 165 a priest saved to burn in the market place <\s>
<s> duly at evening helen came to this lone silent spot from the wrecks of a tale of wilder sorrow so much of sympathy to borrow 170 as soothed her own dark lot <\s>
<s> duly each evening from her home with her fair child would helen come to sit upon that antique seat while the hues of day were pale 175 and the bright boy beside her feet now lay lifting at intervals his broad blue eyes on her now where some sudden impulse calls following <\s>
<s> he was a gentle boy 180 and in all gentle sorts took joy oft in a dry leaf for a boat with a small feather for a sail his fancy on that spring would float if some invisible breeze might stir 185 its marble calm and helen smiled through tears of awe on the gay child to think that a boy as fair as he in years which never more may be by that same fount in that same wood 190 the like sweet fancies had pursued and that a mother lost like her had mournfully sate watching him <\s>

<s> i'll tell thee truth <\s>
<s> he was a man hard selfish loving only gold yet full of guile his pale eyes ran 250 with tears which each some falsehood told and oft his smooth and bridled tongue would give the lie to his flushing cheek he was a coward to the strong he was a tyrant to the weak 255 on whom his vengeance he would wreak for scorn whose arrows search the heart from many a stranger's eye would dart and on his memory cling and follow his soul to its home so cold and hollow <\s>

<s> for long long years 360 these frozen eyes had shed no tears but now 'twas the season fair and mild when april has wept itself to may i sate through the sweet sunny day by my window bowered round with leaves 365 and down my cheeks the quick tears fell like twinkling rain drops from the eaves when warm spring showers are passing o'er <\s>

<s> i'll tell thee truth <\s>
<s> he was a man hard selfish loving only gold yet full of guile his pale eyes ran 250 with tears which each some falsehood told and oft his smooth and bridled tongue would give the lie to his flushing cheek he was a coward to the strong he was a tyrant to the weak 255 on whom his vengeance he would wreak for scorn whose arrows search the heart from many a stranger's eye would dart and on his memory cling and follow his soul to its home so cold and hollow <\s>

<s> then with a laugh both long and wild the youth upon the pavement fell 305 they found him dead <\s>
<s> all looked on me the spasms of my despair to see but i was calm <\s>

<s> i did not weep i did not speak 310 but day by day week after week i walked about like a corpse alive <\s>
<s> sweet friend you must believe this heart is stone it did not break <\s>

<s> when he was in the churchyard lying among the worms we grew quite poor so that no one would give us bread 320 my mother looked at me and said faint words of cheer which only meant that she could die and be content so i went forth from the same church door to another husband's bed <\s>
<s> 325 and this was he who died at last when weeks and months and years had passed through which i firmly did fulfil my duties a devoted wife with the stern step of vanquished will 330 walking beneath the night of life whose hours extinguished like slow rain falling for ever pain by pain the very hope of death's dear rest which since the heart within my breast 335 of natural life was dispossessed its strange sustainer there had been <\s>

<s> pursuing still the path that wound the vast and knotted trees around through which slow shades were wandering to a deep lawny dell they came 105 to a stone seat beside a spring o'er which the columned wood did frame a roofless temple like the fane where ere new creeds could faith obtain man's early race once knelt beneath 110 the overhanging deity <\s>
<s> o'er this fair fountain hung the sky now spangled with rare stars <\s>
<s> the snake the pale snake that with eager breath creeps here his noontide thirst to slake 115 is beaming with many a mingled hue shed from yon dome's eternal blue when he floats on that dark and lucid flood in the light of his own loveliness and the birds that in the fountain dip 120 their plumes with fearless fellowship above and round him wheel and hover <\s>
<s> the fitful wind is heard to stir one solitary leaf on high the chirping of the grasshopper 125 fills every pause <\s>
<s> there is emotion in all that dwells at noontide here then through the intricate wild wood a maze of life and light and motion is woven <\s>
<s> but there is stillness now 130 gloom and the trance of nature now the snake is in his cave asleep the birds are on the branches dreaming only the shadows creep only the glow worm is gleaming 135 only the owls and the nightingales wake in this dell when daylight fails and gray shades gather in the woods and the owls have all fled far away in a merrier glen to hoot and play 140 for the moon is veiled and sleeping now <\s>
<s> the accustomed nightingale still broods on her accustomed bough but she is mute for her false mate has fled and left her desolate <\s>
<s> 145 this silent spot tradition old had peopled with the spectral dead <\s>
<s> for the roots of the speaker's hair felt cold and stiff as with tremulous lips he told that a hellish shape at midnight led 150 the ghost of a youth with hoary hair and sate on the seat beside him there till a naked child came wandering by when the fiend would change to a lady fair <\s>
<s> the truth was worse 155 for here a sister and a brother had solemnized a monstrous curse meeting in this fair solitude for beneath yon very sky had they resigned to one another 160 body and soul <\s>
<s> the multitude tracking them to the secret wood tore limb from limb their innocent child and stabbed and trampled on its mother but the youth for god's most holy grace 165 a priest saved to burn in the market place <\s>
<s> duly at evening helen came to this lone silent spot from the wrecks of a tale of wilder sorrow so much of sympathy to borrow 170 as soothed her own dark lot <\s>
<s> duly each evening from her home with her fair child would helen come to sit upon that antique seat while the hues of day were pale 175 and the bright boy beside her feet now lay lifting at intervals his broad blue eyes on her now where some sudden impulse calls following <\s>
<s> he was a gentle boy 180 and in all gentle sorts took joy oft in a dry leaf for a boat with a small feather for a sail his fancy on that spring would float if some invisible breeze might stir 185 its marble calm and helen smiled through tears of awe on the gay child to think that a boy as fair as he in years which never more may be by that same fount in that same wood 190 the like sweet fancies had pursued and that a mother lost like her had mournfully sate watching him <\s>
<s> then all the scene was wont to swim through the mist of a burning tear <\s>
<s> 195 for many months had helen known this scene and now she thither turned her footsteps not alone <\s>

<s> like the autumn wind when it unbinds the tangled locks of the nightshade's hair which is twined in the sultry summer air round the walls of an outworn sepulchre 210 did the voice of helen sad and sweet and the sound of her heart that ever beat as with sighs and words she breathed on her unbind the knots of her friend's despair till her thoughts were free to float and flow 215 and from her labouring bosom now like the bursting of a prisoned flame the voice of a long pent sorrow came <\s>
<s> rosalind i saw the dark earth fall upon the coffin and i saw the stone 220 laid over him whom this cold breast had pillowed to his nightly rest <\s>
<s> thou knowest not thou canst not know my agony <\s>
<s> i could not weep the sources whence such blessings flow 225 were not to be approached by me <\s>
<s> but i could smile and i could sleep though with a self accusing heart <\s>
<s> in morning's light in evening's gloom i watched and would not thence depart 230 my husband's unlamented tomb <\s>
<s> my children knew their sire was gone but when i told them he is dead they laughed aloud in frantic glee they clapped their hands and leaped about 235 answering each other's ecstasy with many a prank and merry shout <\s>
<s> but i sate silent and alone wrapped in the mock of mourning weed <\s>
<s> they laughed for he was dead but i 240 sate with a hard and tearless eye and with a heart which would deny the secret joy it could not quell low muttering o'er his loathed name till from that self contention came 245 remorse where sin was none a hell which in pure spirits should not dwell <\s>
<s> i'll tell thee truth <\s>
<s> he was a man hard selfish loving only gold yet full of guile his pale eyes ran 250 with tears which each some falsehood told and oft his smooth and bridled tongue would give the lie to his flushing cheek he was a coward to the strong he was a tyrant to the weak 255 on whom his vengeance he would wreak for scorn whose arrows search the heart from many a stranger's eye would dart and on his memory cling and follow his soul to its home so cold and hollow <\s>
<s> 260 he was a tyrant to the weak and we were such alas the day <\s>
<s> oft when my little ones at play were in youth's natural lightness gay or if they listened to some tale 265 of travellers or of fairy land when the light from the wood fire's dying brand flashed on their faces if they heard or thought they heard upon the stair his footstep the suspended word 270 died on my lips we all grew pale the babe at my bosom was hushed with fear if it thought it heard its father near and my two wild boys would near my knee cling cowed and cowering fearfully <\s>
<s> 275 i'll tell thee truth i loved another <\s>
<s> his name in my ear was ever ringing his form to my brain was ever clinging yet if some stranger breathed that name my lips turned white and my heart beat fast 280 my nights were once haunted by dreams of flame my days were dim in the shadow cast by the memory of the same <\s>
<s> day and night day and night he was my breath and life and light 285 for three short years which soon were passed <\s>
<s> on the fourth my gentle mother led me to the shrine to be his sworn bride eternally <\s>
<s> and now we stood on the altar stair 290 when my father came from a distant land and with a loud and fearful cry rushed between us suddenly <\s>
<s> i saw the stream of his thin gray hair i saw his lean and lifted hand 295 and heard his words and live <\s>
<s> wherefore do i live hold hold <\s>
<s> he cried i tell thee tis her brother <\s>
<s> thy mother boy beneath the sod of yon churchyard rests in her shroud so cold 300 i am now weak and pale and old we were once dear to one another i and that corpse <\s>
<s> thou art our child <\s>
<s> then with a laugh both long and wild the youth upon the pavement fell 305 they found him dead <\s>
<s> all looked on me the spasms of my despair to see but i was calm <\s>
<s> i went away i was clammy cold like clay <\s>
<s> i did not weep i did not speak 310 but day by day week after week i walked about like a corpse alive <\s>
<s> sweet friend you must believe this heart is stone it did not break <\s>
<s> my father lived a little while 315 but all might see that he was dying he smiled with such a woeful smile <\s>
<s> when he was in the churchyard lying among the worms we grew quite poor so that no one would give us bread 320 my mother looked at me and said faint words of cheer which only meant that she could die and be content so i went forth from the same church door to another husband's bed <\s>
<s> 325 and this was he who died at last when weeks and months and years had passed through which i firmly did fulfil my duties a devoted wife with the stern step of vanquished will 330 walking beneath the night of life whose hours extinguished like slow rain falling for ever pain by pain the very hope of death's dear rest which since the heart within my breast 335 of natural life was dispossessed its strange sustainer there had been <\s>
<s> when flowers were dead and grass was green upon my mother's grave that mother whom to outlive and cheer and make 340 my wan eyes glitter for her sake was my vowed task the single care which once gave life to my despair when she was a thing that did not stir and the crawling worms were cradling her 345 to a sleep more deep and so more sweet than a baby's rocked on its nurse's knee i lived a living pulse then beat beneath my heart that awakened me <\s>
<s> what was this pulse so warm and free <\s>
<s> i knew it could not be my own dull blood twas like a thought of liquid love that spread and wrought under my bosom and in my brain and crept with the blood through every vein 355 and hour by hour day after day the wonder could not charm away but laid in sleep my wakeful pain until i knew it was a child and then i wept <\s>
<s> for long long years 360 these frozen eyes had shed no tears but now 'twas the season fair and mild when april has wept itself to may i sate through the sweet sunny day by my window bowered round with leaves 365 and down my cheeks the quick tears fell like twinkling rain drops from the eaves when warm spring showers are passing o'er <\s>
<s> o helen none can ever tell the joy it was to weep once more <\s>
<s> 370 i wept to think how hard it were to kill my babe and take from it the sense of light and the warm air and my own fond and tender care and love and smiles ere i knew yet 375 that these for it might as for me be the masks of a grinning mockery <\s>
<s> and haply i would dream twere sweet to feed it from my faded breast or mark my own heart's restless beat 380 rock it to its untroubled rest and watch the growing soul beneath dawn in faint smiles and hear its breath half interrupted by calm sighs and search the depth of its fair eyes 385 for long departed memories <\s>
<s> and so i lived till that sweet load was lightened <\s>
<s> darkly forward flowed the stream of years and on it bore two shapes of gladness to my sight 390 two other babes delightful more in my lost soul's abandoned night than their own country ships may be sailing towards wrecked mariners who cling to the rock of a wintry sea <\s>
<s> 395 for each as it came brought soothing tears and a loosening warmth as each one lay sucking the sullen milk away about my frozen heart did play and weaned it oh how painfully 400 as they themselves were weaned each one from that sweet food even from the thirst of death and nothingness and rest strange inmate of a living breast <\s>
<s> which all that i had undergone 405 of grief and shame since she who first the gates of that dark refuge closed came to my sight and almost burst the seal of that lethean spring but these fair shadows interposed 410 for all delights are shadows now <\s>
<s> and from my brain to my dull brow the heavy tears gather and flow i cannot speak oh let me weep <\s>
<s> the tears which fell from her wan eyes 415 glimmered among the moonlight dew her deep hard sobs and heavy sighs their echoes in the darkness threw <\s>
<s> when she grew calm she thus did keep the tenor of her tale he died 420 i know not how he was not old if age be numbered by its years but he was bowed and bent with fears pale with the quenchless thirst of gold which like fierce fever left him weak 425 and his strait lip and bloated cheek were warped in spasms by hollow sneers and selfish cares with barren plough not age had lined his narrow brow and foul and cruel thoughts which feed 430 upon the withering life within like vipers on some poisonous weed <\s>
<s> whether his ill were death or sin none knew until he died indeed and then men owned they were the same <\s>
<s> 435 seven days within my chamber lay that corse and my babes made holiday at last i told them what is death the eldest with a kind of shame came to my knees with silent breath 440 and sate awe stricken at my feet and soon the others left their play and sate there too <\s>

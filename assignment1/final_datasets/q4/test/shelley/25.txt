<s> indian and if my grief should still be dearer to me than all the pleasures in the world beside why would you lighten it note 29 pleasures pleasure 1824 <\s>
<s> lady i offer only 30 that which i seek some human sympathy in this mysterious island <\s>
<s> my friend my sister my beloved what do i say <\s>
<s> my brain is dizzy and i scarce know whether i speak to thee or her <\s>
<s> lady peace perturbed heart <\s>
<s> 35 i am to thee only as thou to mine the passing wind which heals the brow at noon and may strike cold into the breast at night yet cannot linger where it soothes the most or long soothe could it linger <\s>
<s> indian but you said 40 you also loved <\s>
<s> note 32 41 assigned to indian 1824 <\s>
<s> methinks this word of love is fit for all the world and that for gentle hearts another name would speak of gentler thoughts than the world owns <\s>
<s> indian and thou lovest not <\s>
<s> if so 45 young as thou art thou canst afford to weep <\s>
<s> would that i could claim exemption from all the bitterness of that sweet name <\s>
<s> i loved i love and when i love no more let joys and grief perish and leave despair 50 to ring the knell of youth <\s>
<s> he stood beside me the embodied vision of the brightest dream which like a dawn heralds the day of life the shadow of his presence made my world a paradise <\s>
<s> all familiar things he touched 55 all common words he spoke became to me like forms and sounds of a diviner world <\s>
<s> he was as is the sun in his fierce youth as terrible and lovely as a tempest he came and went and left me what i am <\s>
<s> why must i think how oft we two have sate together near the river springs under the green pavilion which the willow spreads on the floor of the unbroken fountain strewn by the nurslings that linger there 65 over that islet paved with flowers and moss while the musk rose leaves like flakes of crimson snow showered on us and the dove mourned in the pine sad prophetess of sorrows not her own <\s>
<s> the crane returned to her unfrozen haunt 70 and the false cuckoo bade the spray good morn and on a wintry bough the widowed bird hid in the deepest night of ivy leaves renewed the vigils of a sleepless sorrow <\s>
<s> i left like her and leaving one like her 75 alike abandoned and abandoning oh <\s>
<s> unlike her in this the gentlest youth whose love had made my sorrows dear to him even as my sorrow made his love to me <\s>
<s> note 71 spray rossetti 1870 woodberry spring forman dowden <\s>
<s> indian one curse of nature stamps in the same mould 80 the features of the wretched and they are as like as violet to violet when memory the ghost their odours keeps mid the cold relics of abandoned joy proceed <\s>
<s> lady he was a simple innocent boy <\s>
<s> 85 i loved him well but not as he desired yet even thus he was content to be a short content for i was indian aside ]: god of heaven <\s>
<s> from such an islet such a river spring <\s>
<s> i dare not ask her if there stood upon it 90 a pleasure dome surmounted by a crescent with steps to the blue water <\s>
<s> aloud it may be that nature masks in life several copies of the same lot so that the sufferers may feel another's sorrow as their own 95 and find in friendship what they lost in love <\s>
<s> that cannot be yet it is strange that we from the same scene by the same path to this realm of abandonment but speak <\s>
<s> your breath your breath is like soft music your words are 100 the echoes of a voice which on my heart sleeps like a melody of early days <\s>
<s> but as you said lady he was so awful yet so beautiful in mystery and terror calming me as the loveliness of heaven 105 soothes the unquiet sea and yet not so for he seemed stormy and would often seem a quenchless sun masked in portentous clouds for such his thoughts and even his actions were but he was not of them nor they of him 110 but as they hid his splendour from the earth <\s>
<s> some said he was a man of blood and peril and steeped in bitter infamy to the lips <\s>
<s> more need was there i should be innocent more need that i should be most true and kind 115 and much more need that there should be found one to share remorse and scorn and solitude and all the ills that wait on those who do the tasks of ruin in the world of life <\s>
<s> he fled and i have followed him <\s>
<s> indian such a one 120 is he who was the winter of my peace <\s>
<s> but fairest stranger when didst thou depart from the far hills where rise the springs of india <\s>
<s> how didst thou pass the intervening sea <\s>
<s> lady if i be sure i am not dreaming now 125 i should not doubt to say it was a dream <\s>
<s> methought a star came down from heaven and rested mid the plants of india which i had given a shelter from the frost within my chamber <\s>
<s> there the meteor lay 130 panting forth light among the leaves and flowers as if it lived and was outworn with speed or that it loved and passion made the pulse of its bright life throb like an anxious heart till it diffused itself and all the chamber 135 and walls seemed melted into emerald fire that burned not in the midst of which appeared a spirit like a child and laughed aloud a thrilling peal of such sweet merriment as made the blood tingle in my warm feet 140 then bent over a vase and murmuring low unintelligible melodies placed something in the mould like melon seeds and slowly faded and in place of it a soft hand issued from the veil of fire 145 holding a cup like a magnolia flower and poured upon the earth within the vase the element with which it overflowed brighter than morning light and purer than the water of the springs of himalah <\s>
<s> 150 note 120 126 such ... dream 1839 omitted 1824 <\s>
<s> indian you waked not <\s>
<s> lady not until my dream became like a child's legend on the tideless sand <\s>
<s> which the first foam erases half and half leaves legible <\s>
<s> at length i rose and went visiting my flowers from pot to pot and thought 155 to set new cuttings in the empty urns and when i came to that beside the lattice i saw two little dark green leaves lifting the light mould at their birth and then i half remembered my forgotten dream <\s>
<s> 160 and day by day green as a gourd in june the plant grew fresh and thick yet no one knew what plant it was its stem and tendrils seemed like emerald snakes mottled and diamonded with azure mail and streaks of woven silver 165 and all the sheaths that folded the dark buds rose like the crest of cobra di capel until the golden eye of the bright flower through the dark lashes of those veined lids ... disencumbered of their silent sleep 170 gazed like a star into the morning light <\s>
<s> its leaves were delicate you almost saw the pulses with which the purple velvet flower was fed to overflow and like a poet's heart 175 changing bright fancy to sweet sentiment changed half the light to fragrance <\s>
<s> it soon fell and to a green and dewy embryo fruit left all its treasured beauty <\s>
<s> day by day i nursed the plant and on the double flute 180 played to it on the sunny winter days soft melodies as sweet as april rain on silent leaves and sang those words in which passion makes echo taunt the sleeping strings and i would send tales of forgotten love 185 late into the lone night and sing wild songs of maids deserted in the olden time and weep like a soft cloud in april's bosom upon the sleeping eyelids of the plant so that perhaps it dreamed that spring was come 190 and crept abroad into the moonlight air and loosened all its limbs as noon by noon the sun averted less his oblique beam <\s>
<s> indian and the plant died not in the frost <\s>
<s> lady it grew and went out of the lattice which i left 195 half open for it trailing its quaint spires along the garden and across the lawn and down the slope of moss and through the tufts of wild flower roots and stumps of trees o'ergrown with simple lichens and old hoary stones 200 on to the margin of the glassy pool even to a nook of unblown violets and lilies of the valley yet unborn under a pine with ivy overgrown <\s>
<s> and theme its fruit lay like a sleeping lizard 205 under the shadows but when spring indeed came to unswathe her infants and the lilies peeped from their bright green masks to wonder at this shape of autumn couched in their recess then it dilated and it grew until 210 one half lay floating on the fountain wave whose pulse elapsed in unlike sympathies kept time among the snowy water lily buds <\s>
<s> its shape was such as summer melody 215 of the south wind in spicy vales might give to some light cloud bound from the golden dawn to fairy isles of evening and it seemed in hue and form that it had been a mirror of all the hues and forms around it and 220 upon it pictured by the sunny beams which from the bright vibrations of the pool were thrown upon the rafters and the roof of boughs and leaves and on the pillared stems of the dark sylvan temple and reflections 225 of every infant flower and star of moss and veined leaf in the azure odorous air <\s>
<s> and thus it lay in the elysian calm of its own beauty floating on the line which like a film in purest space divided 230 the heaven beneath the water from the heaven above the clouds and every day i went watching its growth and wondering and as the day grew hot methought i saw a glassy vapour dancing on the pool 235 and on it little quaint and filmy shapes <\s>
<s> with dizzy motion wheel and rise and fall like clouds of gnats with perfect lineaments <\s>
<s> o friend sleep was a veil uplift from heaven as if heaven dawned upon the world of dream 240 when darkness rose on the extinguished day out of the eastern wilderness <\s>

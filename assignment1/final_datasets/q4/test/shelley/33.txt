<s> and now i suffer more than all before <\s>
<s> for when i heard that juno had devised a tedious voyage for you i put to sea 15 with all my children quaint in search of you and i myself stood on the beaked prow and fixed the naked mast and all my boys leaning upon their oars with splash and strain made white with foam the green and purple sea 20 and so we sought you king <\s>
<s> we were sailing near malea when an eastern wind arose and drove us to this waste aetnean rock the one eyed children of the ocean god the man destroying cyclopses inhabit 25 on this wild shore their solitary caves and one of these named polypheme <\s>
<s> has caught us to be his slaves and so for all delight of bacchic sports sweet dance and melody we keep this lawless giant's wandering flocks <\s>
<s> 30 my sons indeed on far declivities young things themselves tend on the youngling sheep but i remain to fill the water casks or sweeping the hard floor or ministering some impious and abominable meal 35 to the fell cyclops <\s>
<s> i am wearied of it <\s>
<s> and now i must scrape up the littered floor with this great iron rake so to receive my absent master and his evening sheep in a cave neat and clean <\s>
<s> even now i see 40 my children tending the flocks hitherward <\s>
<s> are your sicinnian measures even now the same as when with dance and song you brought young bacchus to althaea's halls <\s>
<s> note 23 waste b wild 1824 cf <\s>
<s> 26 where waste is cancelled for wild locock <\s>
<s> chorus of satyrs strophe where has he of race divine 45 wandered in the winding rocks <\s>
<s> here the air is calm and fine for the father of the flocks here the grass is soft and sweet and the river eddies meet 50 in the trough beside the cave bright as in their fountain wave neither here nor on the dew of the lawny uplands feeding <\s>
<s> oh you come a stone at you 55 will i throw to mend your breeding get along you horned thing wild seditious rambling <\s>
<s> epode an iacchic melody to the golden aphrodite 60 will i lift as erst did i seeking her and her delight with the maenads whose white feet to the music glance and fleet <\s>
<s> bacchus o beloved where 65 shaking wide thy yellow hair wanderest thou alone afar <\s>
<s> to the one eyed cyclops we who by right thy servants are minister in misery 70 in these wretched goat skins clad far from thy delights and thee <\s>
<s> silenus be silent sons command the slaves to drive the gathered flocks into the rock roofed cave <\s>
<s> but what needs this serious haste o father <\s>
<s> 75 silenus i see a grecian vessel on the coast and thence the rowers with some general approaching to this cave about their necks hang empty vessels as they wanted food and water flasks oh miserable strangers <\s>
<s> 80 whence come they that they know not what and who my master is approaching in ill hour the inhospitable roof of polypheme and the cyclopian jaw bone man destroying <\s>
<s> be silent satyrs while i ask and hear 85 whence coming they arrive the aetnean hill <\s>
<s> ulysses friends can you show me some clear water spring the remedy of our thirst <\s>
<s> will any one furnish with food seamen in want of it <\s>
<s> we seem to be arrived 90 at the blithe court of bacchus <\s>
<s> i observe this sportive band of satyrs near the caves <\s>
<s> first let me greet the elder hail <\s>
<s> silenus hail thou o stranger <\s>
<s> tell thy country and thy race <\s>
<s> ulysses the ithacan ulysses and the king 95 of cephalonia <\s>
<s> i know the man wordy and shrewd the son of sisyphus <\s>
<s> ulysses i am the same but do not rail upon me silenus whence sailing do you come to sicily <\s>
<s> ulysses from ilion and from the trojan toils <\s>
<s> 100 silenus how touched you not at your paternal shore <\s>
<s> ulysses the strength of tempests bore me here by force <\s>
<s> silenus the self same accident occurred to me <\s>
<s> ulysses were you then driven here by stress of weather <\s>
<s> silenus following the pirates who had kidnapped bacchus <\s>
<s> 105 ulysses what land is this and who inhabit it silenus aetna the loftiest peak in sicily <\s>
<s> ulysses and are there walls and tower surrounded towns <\s>
<s> silenus there are not these lone rocks are bare of men <\s>
<s> ulysses and who possess the land <\s>
<s> the race of beasts <\s>
<s> 110 silenus cyclops who live in caverns not in houses <\s>
<s> or is the state popular <\s>
<s> silenus shepherds no one obeys any in aught <\s>

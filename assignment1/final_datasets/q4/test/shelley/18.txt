<s> if either peter or cobbett should see this note each will feel more indignation at being compared to the other than at any censure implied in the moral perversion laid to their charge shelley's note note on peter bell the third by mrs <\s>
<s> in this new edition i have added peter bell the third <\s>
<s> a critique on wordsworth's peter bell reached us at leghorn which amused shelley exceedingly and suggested this poem <\s>
<s> i need scarcely observe that nothing personal to the author of peter bell is intended in this poem <\s>
<s> no man ever admired wordsworth's poetry more he read it perpetually and taught others to appreciate its beauties <\s>
<s> this poem is like all others written by shelley ideal <\s>
<s> he conceived the idealism of a poet a man of lofty and creative genius quitting the glorious calling of discovering and announcing the beautiful and good to support and propagate ignorant prejudices and pernicious errors imparting to the unenlightened not that ardour for truth and spirit of toleration which shelley looked on as the sources of the moral improvement and happiness of mankind but false and injurious opinions that evil was good and that ignorance and force were the best allies of purity and virtue <\s>
<s> his idea was that a man gifted even as transcendently as the author of peter bell with the highest qualities of genius must if he fostered such errors be infected with dulness <\s>
<s> this poem was written as a warning not as a narration of the reality <\s>
<s> he was unacquainted personally with wordsworth or with coleridge to whom he alludes in the fifth part of the poem and therefore i repeat his poem is purely ideal it contains something of criticism on the compositions of those great poets but nothing injurious to the men themselves <\s>
<s> no poem contains more of shelley's peculiar views with regard to the errors into which many of the wisest have fallen and the pernicious effects of certain opinions on society <\s>
<s> much of it is beautifully written and though like the burlesque drama of swellfoot it must be looked on as a plaything it has so much merit and poetry so much of himself in it that it cannot fail to interest greatly and by right belongs to the world for whose instruction and benefit it was written <\s>

<s> a critique on wordsworth's peter bell reached us at leghorn which amused shelley exceedingly and suggested this poem <\s>
<s> i need scarcely observe that nothing personal to the author of peter bell is intended in this poem <\s>
<s> no man ever admired wordsworth's poetry more he read it perpetually and taught others to appreciate its beauties <\s>
<s> this poem is like all others written by shelley ideal <\s>
<s> he conceived the idealism of a poet a man of lofty and creative genius quitting the glorious calling of discovering and announcing the beautiful and good to support and propagate ignorant prejudices and pernicious errors imparting to the unenlightened not that ardour for truth and spirit of toleration which shelley looked on as the sources of the moral improvement and happiness of mankind but false and injurious opinions that evil was good and that ignorance and force were the best allies of purity and virtue <\s>
<s> his idea was that a man gifted even as transcendently as the author of peter bell with the highest qualities of genius must if he fostered such errors be infected with dulness <\s>
<s> this poem was written as a warning not as a narration of the reality <\s>
<s> he was unacquainted personally with wordsworth or with coleridge to whom he alludes in the fifth part of the poem and therefore i repeat his poem is purely ideal it contains something of criticism on the compositions of those great poets but nothing injurious to the men themselves <\s>
<s> no poem contains more of shelley's peculiar views with regard to the errors into which many of the wisest have fallen and the pernicious effects of certain opinions on society <\s>
<s> much of it is beautifully written and though like the burlesque drama of swellfoot it must be looked on as a plaything it has so much merit and poetry so much of himself in it that it cannot fail to interest greatly and by right belongs to the world for whose instruction and benefit it was written <\s>

<s> in this new edition i have added peter bell the third <\s>
<s> a critique on wordsworth's peter bell reached us at leghorn which amused shelley exceedingly and suggested this poem <\s>
<s> i need scarcely observe that nothing personal to the author of peter bell is intended in this poem <\s>
<s> no man ever admired wordsworth's poetry more he read it perpetually and taught others to appreciate its beauties <\s>
<s> this poem is like all others written by shelley ideal <\s>
<s> he conceived the idealism of a poet a man of lofty and creative genius quitting the glorious calling of discovering and announcing the beautiful and good to support and propagate ignorant prejudices and pernicious errors imparting to the unenlightened not that ardour for truth and spirit of toleration which shelley looked on as the sources of the moral improvement and happiness of mankind but false and injurious opinions that evil was good and that ignorance and force were the best allies of purity and virtue <\s>
<s> his idea was that a man gifted even as transcendently as the author of peter bell with the highest qualities of genius must if he fostered such errors be infected with dulness <\s>
<s> this poem was written as a warning not as a narration of the reality <\s>
<s> he was unacquainted personally with wordsworth or with coleridge to whom he alludes in the fifth part of the poem and therefore i repeat his poem is purely ideal it contains something of criticism on the compositions of those great poets but nothing injurious to the men themselves <\s>
<s> no poem contains more of shelley's peculiar views with regard to the errors into which many of the wisest have fallen and the pernicious effects of certain opinions on society <\s>
<s> much of it is beautifully written and though like the burlesque drama of swellfoot it must be looked on as a plaything it has so much merit and poetry so much of himself in it that it cannot fail to interest greatly and by right belongs to the world for whose instruction and benefit it was written <\s>

<s> in this new edition i have added peter bell the third <\s>
<s> a critique on wordsworth's peter bell reached us at leghorn which amused shelley exceedingly and suggested this poem <\s>
<s> i need scarcely observe that nothing personal to the author of peter bell is intended in this poem <\s>
<s> no man ever admired wordsworth's poetry more he read it perpetually and taught others to appreciate its beauties <\s>
<s> this poem is like all others written by shelley ideal <\s>
<s> he conceived the idealism of a poet a man of lofty and creative genius quitting the glorious calling of discovering and announcing the beautiful and good to support and propagate ignorant prejudices and pernicious errors imparting to the unenlightened not that ardour for truth and spirit of toleration which shelley looked on as the sources of the moral improvement and happiness of mankind but false and injurious opinions that evil was good and that ignorance and force were the best allies of purity and virtue <\s>
<s> his idea was that a man gifted even as transcendently as the author of peter bell with the highest qualities of genius must if he fostered such errors be infected with dulness <\s>
<s> this poem was written as a warning not as a narration of the reality <\s>
<s> he was unacquainted personally with wordsworth or with coleridge to whom he alludes in the fifth part of the poem and therefore i repeat his poem is purely ideal it contains something of criticism on the compositions of those great poets but nothing injurious to the men themselves <\s>
<s> no poem contains more of shelley's peculiar views with regard to the errors into which many of the wisest have fallen and the pernicious effects of certain opinions on society <\s>
<s> much of it is beautifully written and though like the burlesque drama of swellfoot it must be looked on as a plaything it has so much merit and poetry so much of himself in it that it cannot fail to interest greatly and by right belongs to the world for whose instruction and benefit it was written <\s>

<s> a critique on wordsworth's peter bell reached us at leghorn which amused shelley exceedingly and suggested this poem <\s>
<s> i need scarcely observe that nothing personal to the author of peter bell is intended in this poem <\s>
<s> no man ever admired wordsworth's poetry more he read it perpetually and taught others to appreciate its beauties <\s>
<s> this poem is like all others written by shelley ideal <\s>
<s> he conceived the idealism of a poet a man of lofty and creative genius quitting the glorious calling of discovering and announcing the beautiful and good to support and propagate ignorant prejudices and pernicious errors imparting to the unenlightened not that ardour for truth and spirit of toleration which shelley looked on as the sources of the moral improvement and happiness of mankind but false and injurious opinions that evil was good and that ignorance and force were the best allies of purity and virtue <\s>
<s> his idea was that a man gifted even as transcendently as the author of peter bell with the highest qualities of genius must if he fostered such errors be infected with dulness <\s>
<s> this poem was written as a warning not as a narration of the reality <\s>
<s> he was unacquainted personally with wordsworth or with coleridge to whom he alludes in the fifth part of the poem and therefore i repeat his poem is purely ideal it contains something of criticism on the compositions of those great poets but nothing injurious to the men themselves <\s>
<s> no poem contains more of shelley's peculiar views with regard to the errors into which many of the wisest have fallen and the pernicious effects of certain opinions on society <\s>
<s> much of it is beautifully written and though like the burlesque drama of swellfoot it must be looked on as a plaything it has so much merit and poetry so much of himself in it that it cannot fail to interest greatly and by right belongs to the world for whose instruction and benefit it was written <\s>

<s> in this new edition i have added peter bell the third <\s>
<s> a critique on wordsworth's peter bell reached us at leghorn which amused shelley exceedingly and suggested this poem <\s>
<s> i need scarcely observe that nothing personal to the author of peter bell is intended in this poem <\s>
<s> no man ever admired wordsworth's poetry more he read it perpetually and taught others to appreciate its beauties <\s>
<s> this poem is like all others written by shelley ideal <\s>
<s> he conceived the idealism of a poet a man of lofty and creative genius quitting the glorious calling of discovering and announcing the beautiful and good to support and propagate ignorant prejudices and pernicious errors imparting to the unenlightened not that ardour for truth and spirit of toleration which shelley looked on as the sources of the moral improvement and happiness of mankind but false and injurious opinions that evil was good and that ignorance and force were the best allies of purity and virtue <\s>
<s> his idea was that a man gifted even as transcendently as the author of peter bell with the highest qualities of genius must if he fostered such errors be infected with dulness <\s>
<s> this poem was written as a warning not as a narration of the reality <\s>
<s> he was unacquainted personally with wordsworth or with coleridge to whom he alludes in the fifth part of the poem and therefore i repeat his poem is purely ideal it contains something of criticism on the compositions of those great poets but nothing injurious to the men themselves <\s>
<s> no poem contains more of shelley's peculiar views with regard to the errors into which many of the wisest have fallen and the pernicious effects of certain opinions on society <\s>
<s> much of it is beautifully written and though like the burlesque drama of swellfoot it must be looked on as a plaything it has so much merit and poetry so much of himself in it that it cannot fail to interest greatly and by right belongs to the world for whose instruction and benefit it was written <\s>

<s> in this new edition i have added peter bell the third <\s>
<s> a critique on wordsworth's peter bell reached us at leghorn which amused shelley exceedingly and suggested this poem <\s>
<s> i need scarcely observe that nothing personal to the author of peter bell is intended in this poem <\s>
<s> no man ever admired wordsworth's poetry more he read it perpetually and taught others to appreciate its beauties <\s>
<s> this poem is like all others written by shelley ideal <\s>
<s> he conceived the idealism of a poet a man of lofty and creative genius quitting the glorious calling of discovering and announcing the beautiful and good to support and propagate ignorant prejudices and pernicious errors imparting to the unenlightened not that ardour for truth and spirit of toleration which shelley looked on as the sources of the moral improvement and happiness of mankind but false and injurious opinions that evil was good and that ignorance and force were the best allies of purity and virtue <\s>
<s> his idea was that a man gifted even as transcendently as the author of peter bell with the highest qualities of genius must if he fostered such errors be infected with dulness <\s>
<s> this poem was written as a warning not as a narration of the reality <\s>
<s> he was unacquainted personally with wordsworth or with coleridge to whom he alludes in the fifth part of the poem and therefore i repeat his poem is purely ideal it contains something of criticism on the compositions of those great poets but nothing injurious to the men themselves <\s>
<s> no poem contains more of shelley's peculiar views with regard to the errors into which many of the wisest have fallen and the pernicious effects of certain opinions on society <\s>
<s> much of it is beautifully written and though like the burlesque drama of swellfoot it must be looked on as a plaything it has so much merit and poetry so much of himself in it that it cannot fail to interest greatly and by right belongs to the world for whose instruction and benefit it was written <\s>

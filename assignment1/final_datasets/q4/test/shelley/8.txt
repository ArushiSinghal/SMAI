<s> thetis according to this view of the subject was given in marriage to peleus and prometheus by the permission of jupiter delivered from his captivity by hercules <\s>
<s> had i framed my story on this model i should have done no more than have attempted to restore the lost drama of aeschylus an ambition which if my preference to this mode of treating the subject had incited me to cherish the recollection of the high comparison such an attempt would challenge might well abate <\s>
<s> but in truth i was averse from a catastrophe so feeble as that of reconciling the champion with the oppressor of mankind <\s>
<s> the moral interest of the fable which is so powerfully sustained by the sufferings and endurance of prometheus would be annihilated if we could conceive of him as unsaying his high language and quailing before his successful and perfidious adversary <\s>
<s> the only imaginary being resembling in any degree prometheus is satan and prometheus is in my judgement a more poetical character than satan because in addition to courage and majesty and firm and patient opposition to omnipotent force he is susceptible of being described as exempt from the taints of ambition envy revenge and a desire for personal aggrandisement which in the hero of paradise lost interfere with the interest <\s>
<s> the character of satan engenders in the mind a pernicious casuistry which leads us to weigh his faults with his wrongs and to excuse the former because the latter exceed all measure <\s>
<s> in the minds of those who consider that magnificent fiction with a religious feeling it engenders something worse <\s>
<s> but prometheus is as it were the type of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature impelled by the purest and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends <\s>
<s> this poem was chiefly written upon the mountainous ruins of the baths of caracalla among the flowery glades and thickets of odoriferous blossoming trees which are extended in ever winding labyrinths upon its immense platforms and dizzy arches suspended in the air <\s>
<s> the bright blue sky of rome and the effect of the vigorous awakening spring in that divinest climate and the new life with which it drenches the spirits even to intoxication were the inspiration of this drama <\s>
<s> the imagery which i have employed will be found in many instances to have been drawn from the operations of the human mind or from those external actions by which they are expressed <\s>
<s> this is unusual in modern poetry although dante and shakespeare are full of instances of the same kind dante indeed more than any other poet and with greater success <\s>
<s> but the greek poets as writers to whom no resource of awakening the sympathy of their contemporaries was unknown were in the habitual use of this power and it is the study of their works since a higher merit would probably be denied me to which i am willing that my readers should impute this singularity <\s>
<s> one word is due in candour to the degree in which the study of contemporary writings may have tinged my composition for such has been a topic of censure with regard to poems far more popular and indeed more deservedly popular than mine <\s>
<s> it is impossible that any one who inhabits the same age with such writers as those who stand in the foremost ranks of our own can conscientiously assure himself that his language and tone of thought may not have been modified by the study of the productions of those extraordinary intellects <\s>
<s> it is true that not the spirit of their genius but the forms in which it has manifested itself are due less to the peculiarities of their own minds than to the peculiarity of the moral and intellectual condition of the minds among which they have been produced <\s>
<s> thus a number of writers possess the form whilst they want the spirit of those whom it is alleged they imitate because the former is the endowment of the age in which they live and the latter must be the uncommunicated lightning of their own mind <\s>
<s> the peculiar style of intense and comprehensive imagery which distinguishes the modern literature of england has not been as a general power the product of the imitation of any particular writer <\s>
<s> the mass of capabilities remains at every period materially the same the circumstances which awaken it to action perpetually change <\s>
<s> if england were divided into forty republics each equal in population and extent to athens there is no reason to suppose but that under institutions not more perfect than those of athens each would produce philosophers and poets equal to those who if we except shakespeare have never been surpassed <\s>
<s> we owe the great writers of the golden age of our literature to that fervid awakening of the public mind which shook to dust the oldest and most oppressive form of the christian religion <\s>
<s> we owe milton to the progress and development of the same spirit the sacred milton was let it ever be remembered a republican and a bold inquirer into morals and religion <\s>
<s> the great writers of our own age are we have reason to suppose the companions and forerunners of some unimagined change in our social condition or the opinions which cement it <\s>
<s> the cloud of mind is discharging its collected lightning and the equilibrium between institutions and opinions is now restoring or is about to be restored <\s>
<s> as to imitation poetry is a mimetic art <\s>
<s> it creates but it creates by combination and representation <\s>
<s> poetical abstractions are beautiful and new not because the portions of which they are composed had no previous existence in the mind of man or in nature but because the whole produced by their combination has some intelligible and beautiful analogy with those sources of emotion and thought and with the contemporary condition of them one great poet is a masterpiece of nature which another not only ought to study but must study <\s>
<s> he might as wisely and as easily determine that his mind should no longer be the mirror of all that is lovely in the visible universe as exclude from his contemplation the beautiful which exists in the writings of a great contemporary <\s>
<s> the pretence of doing it would be a presumption in any but the greatest the effect even in him would be strained unnatural and ineffectual <\s>
<s> a poet is the combined product of such internal powers as modify the nature of others and of such external influences as excite and sustain these powers he is not one but both <\s>
<s> every man's mind is in this respect modified by all the objects of nature and art by every word and every suggestion which he ever admitted to act upon his consciousness it is the mirror upon which all forms are reflected and in which they compose one form <\s>
<s> poets not otherwise than philosophers painters sculptors and musicians are in one sense the creators and in another the creations of their age <\s>
<s> from this subjection the loftiest do not escape <\s>
<s> there is a similarity between homer and hesiod between aeschylus and euripides between virgil and horace between dante and petrarch between shakespeare and fletcher between dryden and pope each has a generic resemblance under which their specific distinctions are arranged <\s>
<s> if this similarity be the result of imitation i am willing to confess that i have imitated <\s>
<s> let this opportunity be conceded to me of acknowledging that i have what a scotch philosopher characteristically terms a passion for reforming the world what passion incited him to write and publish his book he omits to explain <\s>
<s> for my part i had rather be damned with plato and lord bacon than go to heaven with paley and malthus <\s>
<s> but it is a mistake to suppose that i dedicate my poetical compositions solely to the direct enforcement of reform or that i consider them in any degree as containing a reasoned system on the theory of human life <\s>
<s> didactic poetry is my abhorrence nothing can be equally well expressed in prose that is not tedious and supererogatory in verse <\s>
<s> my purpose has hitherto been simply to familiarise the highly refined imagination of the more select classes of poetical readers with beautiful idealisms of moral excellence aware that until the mind can love and admire and trust and hope and endure reasoned principles of moral conduct are seeds cast upon the highway of life which the unconscious passenger tramples into dust although they would bear the harvest of his happiness <\s>
<s> should i live to accomplish what i purpose that is produce a systematical history of what appear to me to be the genuine elements of human society let not the advocates of injustice and superstition flatter themselves that i should take aeschylus rather than plato as my model <\s>

<s> whatever talents a person may possess to amuse and instruct others be they ever so inconsiderable he is yet bound to exert them if his attempt be ineffectual let the punishment of an unaccomplished purpose have been sufficient let none trouble themselves to heap the dust of oblivion upon his efforts the pile they raise will betray his grave which might otherwise have been unknown <\s>

<s> such a system would have amounted to a resignation of those claims to preference over their competitors which incited the composition <\s>
<s> the agamemnonian story was exhibited on the athenian theatre with as many variations as dramas <\s>

<s> the moral interest of the fable which is so powerfully sustained by the sufferings and endurance of prometheus would be annihilated if we could conceive of him as unsaying his high language and quailing before his successful and perfidious adversary <\s>
<s> the only imaginary being resembling in any degree prometheus is satan and prometheus is in my judgement a more poetical character than satan because in addition to courage and majesty and firm and patient opposition to omnipotent force he is susceptible of being described as exempt from the taints of ambition envy revenge and a desire for personal aggrandisement which in the hero of paradise lost interfere with the interest <\s>
<s> the character of satan engenders in the mind a pernicious casuistry which leads us to weigh his faults with his wrongs and to excuse the former because the latter exceed all measure <\s>
<s> in the minds of those who consider that magnificent fiction with a religious feeling it engenders something worse <\s>
<s> but prometheus is as it were the type of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature impelled by the purest and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends <\s>
<s> this poem was chiefly written upon the mountainous ruins of the baths of caracalla among the flowery glades and thickets of odoriferous blossoming trees which are extended in ever winding labyrinths upon its immense platforms and dizzy arches suspended in the air <\s>
<s> the bright blue sky of rome and the effect of the vigorous awakening spring in that divinest climate and the new life with which it drenches the spirits even to intoxication were the inspiration of this drama <\s>
<s> the imagery which i have employed will be found in many instances to have been drawn from the operations of the human mind or from those external actions by which they are expressed <\s>
<s> this is unusual in modern poetry although dante and shakespeare are full of instances of the same kind dante indeed more than any other poet and with greater success <\s>
<s> but the greek poets as writers to whom no resource of awakening the sympathy of their contemporaries was unknown were in the habitual use of this power and it is the study of their works since a higher merit would probably be denied me to which i am willing that my readers should impute this singularity <\s>
<s> one word is due in candour to the degree in which the study of contemporary writings may have tinged my composition for such has been a topic of censure with regard to poems far more popular and indeed more deservedly popular than mine <\s>
<s> it is impossible that any one who inhabits the same age with such writers as those who stand in the foremost ranks of our own can conscientiously assure himself that his language and tone of thought may not have been modified by the study of the productions of those extraordinary intellects <\s>
<s> it is true that not the spirit of their genius but the forms in which it has manifested itself are due less to the peculiarities of their own minds than to the peculiarity of the moral and intellectual condition of the minds among which they have been produced <\s>
<s> thus a number of writers possess the form whilst they want the spirit of those whom it is alleged they imitate because the former is the endowment of the age in which they live and the latter must be the uncommunicated lightning of their own mind <\s>
<s> the peculiar style of intense and comprehensive imagery which distinguishes the modern literature of england has not been as a general power the product of the imitation of any particular writer <\s>
<s> the mass of capabilities remains at every period materially the same the circumstances which awaken it to action perpetually change <\s>
<s> if england were divided into forty republics each equal in population and extent to athens there is no reason to suppose but that under institutions not more perfect than those of athens each would produce philosophers and poets equal to those who if we except shakespeare have never been surpassed <\s>
<s> we owe the great writers of the golden age of our literature to that fervid awakening of the public mind which shook to dust the oldest and most oppressive form of the christian religion <\s>
<s> we owe milton to the progress and development of the same spirit the sacred milton was let it ever be remembered a republican and a bold inquirer into morals and religion <\s>

<s> the cloud of mind is discharging its collected lightning and the equilibrium between institutions and opinions is now restoring or is about to be restored <\s>
<s> as to imitation poetry is a mimetic art <\s>
<s> it creates but it creates by combination and representation <\s>
<s> poetical abstractions are beautiful and new not because the portions of which they are composed had no previous existence in the mind of man or in nature but because the whole produced by their combination has some intelligible and beautiful analogy with those sources of emotion and thought and with the contemporary condition of them one great poet is a masterpiece of nature which another not only ought to study but must study <\s>
<s> he might as wisely and as easily determine that his mind should no longer be the mirror of all that is lovely in the visible universe as exclude from his contemplation the beautiful which exists in the writings of a great contemporary <\s>
<s> the pretence of doing it would be a presumption in any but the greatest the effect even in him would be strained unnatural and ineffectual <\s>
<s> a poet is the combined product of such internal powers as modify the nature of others and of such external influences as excite and sustain these powers he is not one but both <\s>
<s> every man's mind is in this respect modified by all the objects of nature and art by every word and every suggestion which he ever admitted to act upon his consciousness it is the mirror upon which all forms are reflected and in which they compose one form <\s>
<s> poets not otherwise than philosophers painters sculptors and musicians are in one sense the creators and in another the creations of their age <\s>
<s> from this subjection the loftiest do not escape <\s>
<s> there is a similarity between homer and hesiod between aeschylus and euripides between virgil and horace between dante and petrarch between shakespeare and fletcher between dryden and pope each has a generic resemblance under which their specific distinctions are arranged <\s>

<s> for my part i had rather be damned with plato and lord bacon than go to heaven with paley and malthus <\s>
<s> but it is a mistake to suppose that i dedicate my poetical compositions solely to the direct enforcement of reform or that i consider them in any degree as containing a reasoned system on the theory of human life <\s>
<s> didactic poetry is my abhorrence nothing can be equally well expressed in prose that is not tedious and supererogatory in verse <\s>
<s> my purpose has hitherto been simply to familiarise the highly refined imagination of the more select classes of poetical readers with beautiful idealisms of moral excellence aware that until the mind can love and admire and trust and hope and endure reasoned principles of moral conduct are seeds cast upon the highway of life which the unconscious passenger tramples into dust although they would bear the harvest of his happiness <\s>

<s> had i framed my story on this model i should have done no more than have attempted to restore the lost drama of aeschylus an ambition which if my preference to this mode of treating the subject had incited me to cherish the recollection of the high comparison such an attempt would challenge might well abate <\s>

<s> the moral interest of the fable which is so powerfully sustained by the sufferings and endurance of prometheus would be annihilated if we could conceive of him as unsaying his high language and quailing before his successful and perfidious adversary <\s>
<s> the only imaginary being resembling in any degree prometheus is satan and prometheus is in my judgement a more poetical character than satan because in addition to courage and majesty and firm and patient opposition to omnipotent force he is susceptible of being described as exempt from the taints of ambition envy revenge and a desire for personal aggrandisement which in the hero of paradise lost interfere with the interest <\s>
<s> the character of satan engenders in the mind a pernicious casuistry which leads us to weigh his faults with his wrongs and to excuse the former because the latter exceed all measure <\s>
<s> in the minds of those who consider that magnificent fiction with a religious feeling it engenders something worse <\s>
<s> but prometheus is as it were the type of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature impelled by the purest and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends <\s>
<s> this poem was chiefly written upon the mountainous ruins of the baths of caracalla among the flowery glades and thickets of odoriferous blossoming trees which are extended in ever winding labyrinths upon its immense platforms and dizzy arches suspended in the air <\s>
<s> the bright blue sky of rome and the effect of the vigorous awakening spring in that divinest climate and the new life with which it drenches the spirits even to intoxication were the inspiration of this drama <\s>
<s> the imagery which i have employed will be found in many instances to have been drawn from the operations of the human mind or from those external actions by which they are expressed <\s>
<s> this is unusual in modern poetry although dante and shakespeare are full of instances of the same kind dante indeed more than any other poet and with greater success <\s>
<s> but the greek poets as writers to whom no resource of awakening the sympathy of their contemporaries was unknown were in the habitual use of this power and it is the study of their works since a higher merit would probably be denied me to which i am willing that my readers should impute this singularity <\s>
<s> one word is due in candour to the degree in which the study of contemporary writings may have tinged my composition for such has been a topic of censure with regard to poems far more popular and indeed more deservedly popular than mine <\s>
<s> it is impossible that any one who inhabits the same age with such writers as those who stand in the foremost ranks of our own can conscientiously assure himself that his language and tone of thought may not have been modified by the study of the productions of those extraordinary intellects <\s>
<s> it is true that not the spirit of their genius but the forms in which it has manifested itself are due less to the peculiarities of their own minds than to the peculiarity of the moral and intellectual condition of the minds among which they have been produced <\s>
<s> thus a number of writers possess the form whilst they want the spirit of those whom it is alleged they imitate because the former is the endowment of the age in which they live and the latter must be the uncommunicated lightning of their own mind <\s>

<s> such a system would have amounted to a resignation of those claims to preference over their competitors which incited the composition <\s>

<s> i have presumed to employ a similar license <\s>
<s> the prometheus unbound of aeschylus supposed the reconciliation of jupiter with his victim as the price of the disclosure of the danger threatened to his empire by the consummation of his marriage with thetis <\s>
<s> thetis according to this view of the subject was given in marriage to peleus and prometheus by the permission of jupiter delivered from his captivity by hercules <\s>
<s> had i framed my story on this model i should have done no more than have attempted to restore the lost drama of aeschylus an ambition which if my preference to this mode of treating the subject had incited me to cherish the recollection of the high comparison such an attempt would challenge might well abate <\s>
<s> but in truth i was averse from a catastrophe so feeble as that of reconciling the champion with the oppressor of mankind <\s>
<s> the moral interest of the fable which is so powerfully sustained by the sufferings and endurance of prometheus would be annihilated if we could conceive of him as unsaying his high language and quailing before his successful and perfidious adversary <\s>
<s> the only imaginary being resembling in any degree prometheus is satan and prometheus is in my judgement a more poetical character than satan because in addition to courage and majesty and firm and patient opposition to omnipotent force he is susceptible of being described as exempt from the taints of ambition envy revenge and a desire for personal aggrandisement which in the hero of paradise lost interfere with the interest <\s>
<s> the character of satan engenders in the mind a pernicious casuistry which leads us to weigh his faults with his wrongs and to excuse the former because the latter exceed all measure <\s>
<s> in the minds of those who consider that magnificent fiction with a religious feeling it engenders something worse <\s>
<s> but prometheus is as it were the type of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature impelled by the purest and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends <\s>
<s> this poem was chiefly written upon the mountainous ruins of the baths of caracalla among the flowery glades and thickets of odoriferous blossoming trees which are extended in ever winding labyrinths upon its immense platforms and dizzy arches suspended in the air <\s>
<s> the bright blue sky of rome and the effect of the vigorous awakening spring in that divinest climate and the new life with which it drenches the spirits even to intoxication were the inspiration of this drama <\s>
<s> the imagery which i have employed will be found in many instances to have been drawn from the operations of the human mind or from those external actions by which they are expressed <\s>
<s> this is unusual in modern poetry although dante and shakespeare are full of instances of the same kind dante indeed more than any other poet and with greater success <\s>
<s> but the greek poets as writers to whom no resource of awakening the sympathy of their contemporaries was unknown were in the habitual use of this power and it is the study of their works since a higher merit would probably be denied me to which i am willing that my readers should impute this singularity <\s>
<s> one word is due in candour to the degree in which the study of contemporary writings may have tinged my composition for such has been a topic of censure with regard to poems far more popular and indeed more deservedly popular than mine <\s>
<s> it is impossible that any one who inhabits the same age with such writers as those who stand in the foremost ranks of our own can conscientiously assure himself that his language and tone of thought may not have been modified by the study of the productions of those extraordinary intellects <\s>
<s> it is true that not the spirit of their genius but the forms in which it has manifested itself are due less to the peculiarities of their own minds than to the peculiarity of the moral and intellectual condition of the minds among which they have been produced <\s>
<s> thus a number of writers possess the form whilst they want the spirit of those whom it is alleged they imitate because the former is the endowment of the age in which they live and the latter must be the uncommunicated lightning of their own mind <\s>
<s> the peculiar style of intense and comprehensive imagery which distinguishes the modern literature of england has not been as a general power the product of the imitation of any particular writer <\s>
<s> the mass of capabilities remains at every period materially the same the circumstances which awaken it to action perpetually change <\s>
<s> if england were divided into forty republics each equal in population and extent to athens there is no reason to suppose but that under institutions not more perfect than those of athens each would produce philosophers and poets equal to those who if we except shakespeare have never been surpassed <\s>
<s> we owe the great writers of the golden age of our literature to that fervid awakening of the public mind which shook to dust the oldest and most oppressive form of the christian religion <\s>
<s> we owe milton to the progress and development of the same spirit the sacred milton was let it ever be remembered a republican and a bold inquirer into morals and religion <\s>
<s> the great writers of our own age are we have reason to suppose the companions and forerunners of some unimagined change in our social condition or the opinions which cement it <\s>
<s> the cloud of mind is discharging its collected lightning and the equilibrium between institutions and opinions is now restoring or is about to be restored <\s>
<s> as to imitation poetry is a mimetic art <\s>
<s> it creates but it creates by combination and representation <\s>
<s> poetical abstractions are beautiful and new not because the portions of which they are composed had no previous existence in the mind of man or in nature but because the whole produced by their combination has some intelligible and beautiful analogy with those sources of emotion and thought and with the contemporary condition of them one great poet is a masterpiece of nature which another not only ought to study but must study <\s>
<s> he might as wisely and as easily determine that his mind should no longer be the mirror of all that is lovely in the visible universe as exclude from his contemplation the beautiful which exists in the writings of a great contemporary <\s>
<s> the pretence of doing it would be a presumption in any but the greatest the effect even in him would be strained unnatural and ineffectual <\s>
<s> a poet is the combined product of such internal powers as modify the nature of others and of such external influences as excite and sustain these powers he is not one but both <\s>
<s> every man's mind is in this respect modified by all the objects of nature and art by every word and every suggestion which he ever admitted to act upon his consciousness it is the mirror upon which all forms are reflected and in which they compose one form <\s>
<s> poets not otherwise than philosophers painters sculptors and musicians are in one sense the creators and in another the creations of their age <\s>
<s> from this subjection the loftiest do not escape <\s>
<s> there is a similarity between homer and hesiod between aeschylus and euripides between virgil and horace between dante and petrarch between shakespeare and fletcher between dryden and pope each has a generic resemblance under which their specific distinctions are arranged <\s>
<s> if this similarity be the result of imitation i am willing to confess that i have imitated <\s>
<s> let this opportunity be conceded to me of acknowledging that i have what a scotch philosopher characteristically terms a passion for reforming the world what passion incited him to write and publish his book he omits to explain <\s>
<s> for my part i had rather be damned with plato and lord bacon than go to heaven with paley and malthus <\s>
<s> but it is a mistake to suppose that i dedicate my poetical compositions solely to the direct enforcement of reform or that i consider them in any degree as containing a reasoned system on the theory of human life <\s>
<s> didactic poetry is my abhorrence nothing can be equally well expressed in prose that is not tedious and supererogatory in verse <\s>
<s> my purpose has hitherto been simply to familiarise the highly refined imagination of the more select classes of poetical readers with beautiful idealisms of moral excellence aware that until the mind can love and admire and trust and hope and endure reasoned principles of moral conduct are seeds cast upon the highway of life which the unconscious passenger tramples into dust although they would bear the harvest of his happiness <\s>
<s> should i live to accomplish what i purpose that is produce a systematical history of what appear to me to be the genuine elements of human society let not the advocates of injustice and superstition flatter themselves that i should take aeschylus rather than plato as my model <\s>

<s> whatever talents a person may possess to amuse and instruct others be they ever so inconsiderable he is yet bound to exert them if his attempt be ineffectual let the punishment of an unaccomplished purpose have been sufficient let none trouble themselves to heap the dust of oblivion upon his efforts the pile they raise will betray his grave which might otherwise have been unknown <\s>

<s> such a system would have amounted to a resignation of those claims to preference over their competitors which incited the composition <\s>
<s> the agamemnonian story was exhibited on the athenian theatre with as many variations as dramas <\s>
<s> i have presumed to employ a similar license <\s>

<s> thetis according to this view of the subject was given in marriage to peleus and prometheus by the permission of jupiter delivered from his captivity by hercules <\s>
<s> had i framed my story on this model i should have done no more than have attempted to restore the lost drama of aeschylus an ambition which if my preference to this mode of treating the subject had incited me to cherish the recollection of the high comparison such an attempt would challenge might well abate <\s>
<s> but in truth i was averse from a catastrophe so feeble as that of reconciling the champion with the oppressor of mankind <\s>
<s> the moral interest of the fable which is so powerfully sustained by the sufferings and endurance of prometheus would be annihilated if we could conceive of him as unsaying his high language and quailing before his successful and perfidious adversary <\s>
<s> the only imaginary being resembling in any degree prometheus is satan and prometheus is in my judgement a more poetical character than satan because in addition to courage and majesty and firm and patient opposition to omnipotent force he is susceptible of being described as exempt from the taints of ambition envy revenge and a desire for personal aggrandisement which in the hero of paradise lost interfere with the interest <\s>
<s> the character of satan engenders in the mind a pernicious casuistry which leads us to weigh his faults with his wrongs and to excuse the former because the latter exceed all measure <\s>
<s> in the minds of those who consider that magnificent fiction with a religious feeling it engenders something worse <\s>
<s> but prometheus is as it were the type of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature impelled by the purest and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends <\s>
<s> this poem was chiefly written upon the mountainous ruins of the baths of caracalla among the flowery glades and thickets of odoriferous blossoming trees which are extended in ever winding labyrinths upon its immense platforms and dizzy arches suspended in the air <\s>
<s> the bright blue sky of rome and the effect of the vigorous awakening spring in that divinest climate and the new life with which it drenches the spirits even to intoxication were the inspiration of this drama <\s>
<s> the imagery which i have employed will be found in many instances to have been drawn from the operations of the human mind or from those external actions by which they are expressed <\s>
<s> this is unusual in modern poetry although dante and shakespeare are full of instances of the same kind dante indeed more than any other poet and with greater success <\s>
<s> but the greek poets as writers to whom no resource of awakening the sympathy of their contemporaries was unknown were in the habitual use of this power and it is the study of their works since a higher merit would probably be denied me to which i am willing that my readers should impute this singularity <\s>
<s> one word is due in candour to the degree in which the study of contemporary writings may have tinged my composition for such has been a topic of censure with regard to poems far more popular and indeed more deservedly popular than mine <\s>
<s> it is impossible that any one who inhabits the same age with such writers as those who stand in the foremost ranks of our own can conscientiously assure himself that his language and tone of thought may not have been modified by the study of the productions of those extraordinary intellects <\s>
<s> it is true that not the spirit of their genius but the forms in which it has manifested itself are due less to the peculiarities of their own minds than to the peculiarity of the moral and intellectual condition of the minds among which they have been produced <\s>
<s> thus a number of writers possess the form whilst they want the spirit of those whom it is alleged they imitate because the former is the endowment of the age in which they live and the latter must be the uncommunicated lightning of their own mind <\s>
<s> the peculiar style of intense and comprehensive imagery which distinguishes the modern literature of england has not been as a general power the product of the imitation of any particular writer <\s>
<s> the mass of capabilities remains at every period materially the same the circumstances which awaken it to action perpetually change <\s>
<s> if england were divided into forty republics each equal in population and extent to athens there is no reason to suppose but that under institutions not more perfect than those of athens each would produce philosophers and poets equal to those who if we except shakespeare have never been surpassed <\s>
<s> we owe the great writers of the golden age of our literature to that fervid awakening of the public mind which shook to dust the oldest and most oppressive form of the christian religion <\s>
<s> we owe milton to the progress and development of the same spirit the sacred milton was let it ever be remembered a republican and a bold inquirer into morals and religion <\s>
<s> the great writers of our own age are we have reason to suppose the companions and forerunners of some unimagined change in our social condition or the opinions which cement it <\s>
<s> the cloud of mind is discharging its collected lightning and the equilibrium between institutions and opinions is now restoring or is about to be restored <\s>
<s> as to imitation poetry is a mimetic art <\s>
<s> it creates but it creates by combination and representation <\s>
<s> poetical abstractions are beautiful and new not because the portions of which they are composed had no previous existence in the mind of man or in nature but because the whole produced by their combination has some intelligible and beautiful analogy with those sources of emotion and thought and with the contemporary condition of them one great poet is a masterpiece of nature which another not only ought to study but must study <\s>
<s> he might as wisely and as easily determine that his mind should no longer be the mirror of all that is lovely in the visible universe as exclude from his contemplation the beautiful which exists in the writings of a great contemporary <\s>
<s> the pretence of doing it would be a presumption in any but the greatest the effect even in him would be strained unnatural and ineffectual <\s>
<s> a poet is the combined product of such internal powers as modify the nature of others and of such external influences as excite and sustain these powers he is not one but both <\s>
<s> every man's mind is in this respect modified by all the objects of nature and art by every word and every suggestion which he ever admitted to act upon his consciousness it is the mirror upon which all forms are reflected and in which they compose one form <\s>
<s> poets not otherwise than philosophers painters sculptors and musicians are in one sense the creators and in another the creations of their age <\s>
<s> from this subjection the loftiest do not escape <\s>
<s> there is a similarity between homer and hesiod between aeschylus and euripides between virgil and horace between dante and petrarch between shakespeare and fletcher between dryden and pope each has a generic resemblance under which their specific distinctions are arranged <\s>
<s> if this similarity be the result of imitation i am willing to confess that i have imitated <\s>
<s> let this opportunity be conceded to me of acknowledging that i have what a scotch philosopher characteristically terms a passion for reforming the world what passion incited him to write and publish his book he omits to explain <\s>
<s> for my part i had rather be damned with plato and lord bacon than go to heaven with paley and malthus <\s>
<s> but it is a mistake to suppose that i dedicate my poetical compositions solely to the direct enforcement of reform or that i consider them in any degree as containing a reasoned system on the theory of human life <\s>
<s> didactic poetry is my abhorrence nothing can be equally well expressed in prose that is not tedious and supererogatory in verse <\s>
<s> my purpose has hitherto been simply to familiarise the highly refined imagination of the more select classes of poetical readers with beautiful idealisms of moral excellence aware that until the mind can love and admire and trust and hope and endure reasoned principles of moral conduct are seeds cast upon the highway of life which the unconscious passenger tramples into dust although they would bear the harvest of his happiness <\s>
<s> should i live to accomplish what i purpose that is produce a systematical history of what appear to me to be the genuine elements of human society let not the advocates of injustice and superstition flatter themselves that i should take aeschylus rather than plato as my model <\s>

<s> such a system would have amounted to a resignation of those claims to preference over their competitors which incited the composition <\s>

<s> the prometheus unbound of aeschylus supposed the reconciliation of jupiter with his victim as the price of the disclosure of the danger threatened to his empire by the consummation of his marriage with thetis <\s>
<s> thetis according to this view of the subject was given in marriage to peleus and prometheus by the permission of jupiter delivered from his captivity by hercules <\s>
<s> had i framed my story on this model i should have done no more than have attempted to restore the lost drama of aeschylus an ambition which if my preference to this mode of treating the subject had incited me to cherish the recollection of the high comparison such an attempt would challenge might well abate <\s>
<s> but in truth i was averse from a catastrophe so feeble as that of reconciling the champion with the oppressor of mankind <\s>
<s> the moral interest of the fable which is so powerfully sustained by the sufferings and endurance of prometheus would be annihilated if we could conceive of him as unsaying his high language and quailing before his successful and perfidious adversary <\s>
<s> the only imaginary being resembling in any degree prometheus is satan and prometheus is in my judgement a more poetical character than satan because in addition to courage and majesty and firm and patient opposition to omnipotent force he is susceptible of being described as exempt from the taints of ambition envy revenge and a desire for personal aggrandisement which in the hero of paradise lost interfere with the interest <\s>
<s> the character of satan engenders in the mind a pernicious casuistry which leads us to weigh his faults with his wrongs and to excuse the former because the latter exceed all measure <\s>
<s> in the minds of those who consider that magnificent fiction with a religious feeling it engenders something worse <\s>
<s> but prometheus is as it were the type of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature impelled by the purest and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends <\s>
<s> this poem was chiefly written upon the mountainous ruins of the baths of caracalla among the flowery glades and thickets of odoriferous blossoming trees which are extended in ever winding labyrinths upon its immense platforms and dizzy arches suspended in the air <\s>
<s> the bright blue sky of rome and the effect of the vigorous awakening spring in that divinest climate and the new life with which it drenches the spirits even to intoxication were the inspiration of this drama <\s>
<s> the imagery which i have employed will be found in many instances to have been drawn from the operations of the human mind or from those external actions by which they are expressed <\s>
<s> this is unusual in modern poetry although dante and shakespeare are full of instances of the same kind dante indeed more than any other poet and with greater success <\s>
<s> but the greek poets as writers to whom no resource of awakening the sympathy of their contemporaries was unknown were in the habitual use of this power and it is the study of their works since a higher merit would probably be denied me to which i am willing that my readers should impute this singularity <\s>
<s> one word is due in candour to the degree in which the study of contemporary writings may have tinged my composition for such has been a topic of censure with regard to poems far more popular and indeed more deservedly popular than mine <\s>
<s> it is impossible that any one who inhabits the same age with such writers as those who stand in the foremost ranks of our own can conscientiously assure himself that his language and tone of thought may not have been modified by the study of the productions of those extraordinary intellects <\s>
<s> it is true that not the spirit of their genius but the forms in which it has manifested itself are due less to the peculiarities of their own minds than to the peculiarity of the moral and intellectual condition of the minds among which they have been produced <\s>
<s> thus a number of writers possess the form whilst they want the spirit of those whom it is alleged they imitate because the former is the endowment of the age in which they live and the latter must be the uncommunicated lightning of their own mind <\s>
<s> the peculiar style of intense and comprehensive imagery which distinguishes the modern literature of england has not been as a general power the product of the imitation of any particular writer <\s>
<s> the mass of capabilities remains at every period materially the same the circumstances which awaken it to action perpetually change <\s>
<s> if england were divided into forty republics each equal in population and extent to athens there is no reason to suppose but that under institutions not more perfect than those of athens each would produce philosophers and poets equal to those who if we except shakespeare have never been surpassed <\s>
<s> we owe the great writers of the golden age of our literature to that fervid awakening of the public mind which shook to dust the oldest and most oppressive form of the christian religion <\s>
<s> we owe milton to the progress and development of the same spirit the sacred milton was let it ever be remembered a republican and a bold inquirer into morals and religion <\s>
<s> the great writers of our own age are we have reason to suppose the companions and forerunners of some unimagined change in our social condition or the opinions which cement it <\s>
<s> the cloud of mind is discharging its collected lightning and the equilibrium between institutions and opinions is now restoring or is about to be restored <\s>
<s> as to imitation poetry is a mimetic art <\s>
<s> it creates but it creates by combination and representation <\s>
<s> poetical abstractions are beautiful and new not because the portions of which they are composed had no previous existence in the mind of man or in nature but because the whole produced by their combination has some intelligible and beautiful analogy with those sources of emotion and thought and with the contemporary condition of them one great poet is a masterpiece of nature which another not only ought to study but must study <\s>
<s> he might as wisely and as easily determine that his mind should no longer be the mirror of all that is lovely in the visible universe as exclude from his contemplation the beautiful which exists in the writings of a great contemporary <\s>
<s> the pretence of doing it would be a presumption in any but the greatest the effect even in him would be strained unnatural and ineffectual <\s>
<s> a poet is the combined product of such internal powers as modify the nature of others and of such external influences as excite and sustain these powers he is not one but both <\s>
<s> every man's mind is in this respect modified by all the objects of nature and art by every word and every suggestion which he ever admitted to act upon his consciousness it is the mirror upon which all forms are reflected and in which they compose one form <\s>
<s> poets not otherwise than philosophers painters sculptors and musicians are in one sense the creators and in another the creations of their age <\s>
<s> from this subjection the loftiest do not escape <\s>
<s> there is a similarity between homer and hesiod between aeschylus and euripides between virgil and horace between dante and petrarch between shakespeare and fletcher between dryden and pope each has a generic resemblance under which their specific distinctions are arranged <\s>

<s> had i framed my story on this model i should have done no more than have attempted to restore the lost drama of aeschylus an ambition which if my preference to this mode of treating the subject had incited me to cherish the recollection of the high comparison such an attempt would challenge might well abate <\s>

<s> the moral interest of the fable which is so powerfully sustained by the sufferings and endurance of prometheus would be annihilated if we could conceive of him as unsaying his high language and quailing before his successful and perfidious adversary <\s>
<s> the only imaginary being resembling in any degree prometheus is satan and prometheus is in my judgement a more poetical character than satan because in addition to courage and majesty and firm and patient opposition to omnipotent force he is susceptible of being described as exempt from the taints of ambition envy revenge and a desire for personal aggrandisement which in the hero of paradise lost interfere with the interest <\s>
<s> the character of satan engenders in the mind a pernicious casuistry which leads us to weigh his faults with his wrongs and to excuse the former because the latter exceed all measure <\s>
<s> in the minds of those who consider that magnificent fiction with a religious feeling it engenders something worse <\s>
<s> but prometheus is as it were the type of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature impelled by the purest and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends <\s>
<s> this poem was chiefly written upon the mountainous ruins of the baths of caracalla among the flowery glades and thickets of odoriferous blossoming trees which are extended in ever winding labyrinths upon its immense platforms and dizzy arches suspended in the air <\s>
<s> the bright blue sky of rome and the effect of the vigorous awakening spring in that divinest climate and the new life with which it drenches the spirits even to intoxication were the inspiration of this drama <\s>
<s> the imagery which i have employed will be found in many instances to have been drawn from the operations of the human mind or from those external actions by which they are expressed <\s>
<s> this is unusual in modern poetry although dante and shakespeare are full of instances of the same kind dante indeed more than any other poet and with greater success <\s>
<s> but the greek poets as writers to whom no resource of awakening the sympathy of their contemporaries was unknown were in the habitual use of this power and it is the study of their works since a higher merit would probably be denied me to which i am willing that my readers should impute this singularity <\s>
<s> one word is due in candour to the degree in which the study of contemporary writings may have tinged my composition for such has been a topic of censure with regard to poems far more popular and indeed more deservedly popular than mine <\s>
<s> it is impossible that any one who inhabits the same age with such writers as those who stand in the foremost ranks of our own can conscientiously assure himself that his language and tone of thought may not have been modified by the study of the productions of those extraordinary intellects <\s>
<s> it is true that not the spirit of their genius but the forms in which it has manifested itself are due less to the peculiarities of their own minds than to the peculiarity of the moral and intellectual condition of the minds among which they have been produced <\s>
<s> thus a number of writers possess the form whilst they want the spirit of those whom it is alleged they imitate because the former is the endowment of the age in which they live and the latter must be the uncommunicated lightning of their own mind <\s>
<s> the peculiar style of intense and comprehensive imagery which distinguishes the modern literature of england has not been as a general power the product of the imitation of any particular writer <\s>
<s> the mass of capabilities remains at every period materially the same the circumstances which awaken it to action perpetually change <\s>
<s> if england were divided into forty republics each equal in population and extent to athens there is no reason to suppose but that under institutions not more perfect than those of athens each would produce philosophers and poets equal to those who if we except shakespeare have never been surpassed <\s>
<s> we owe the great writers of the golden age of our literature to that fervid awakening of the public mind which shook to dust the oldest and most oppressive form of the christian religion <\s>
<s> we owe milton to the progress and development of the same spirit the sacred milton was let it ever be remembered a republican and a bold inquirer into morals and religion <\s>
<s> the great writers of our own age are we have reason to suppose the companions and forerunners of some unimagined change in our social condition or the opinions which cement it <\s>
<s> the cloud of mind is discharging its collected lightning and the equilibrium between institutions and opinions is now restoring or is about to be restored <\s>
<s> as to imitation poetry is a mimetic art <\s>
<s> it creates but it creates by combination and representation <\s>
<s> poetical abstractions are beautiful and new not because the portions of which they are composed had no previous existence in the mind of man or in nature but because the whole produced by their combination has some intelligible and beautiful analogy with those sources of emotion and thought and with the contemporary condition of them one great poet is a masterpiece of nature which another not only ought to study but must study <\s>
<s> he might as wisely and as easily determine that his mind should no longer be the mirror of all that is lovely in the visible universe as exclude from his contemplation the beautiful which exists in the writings of a great contemporary <\s>
<s> the pretence of doing it would be a presumption in any but the greatest the effect even in him would be strained unnatural and ineffectual <\s>
<s> a poet is the combined product of such internal powers as modify the nature of others and of such external influences as excite and sustain these powers he is not one but both <\s>
<s> every man's mind is in this respect modified by all the objects of nature and art by every word and every suggestion which he ever admitted to act upon his consciousness it is the mirror upon which all forms are reflected and in which they compose one form <\s>
<s> poets not otherwise than philosophers painters sculptors and musicians are in one sense the creators and in another the creations of their age <\s>
<s> from this subjection the loftiest do not escape <\s>
<s> there is a similarity between homer and hesiod between aeschylus and euripides between virgil and horace between dante and petrarch between shakespeare and fletcher between dryden and pope each has a generic resemblance under which their specific distinctions are arranged <\s>
<s> if this similarity be the result of imitation i am willing to confess that i have imitated <\s>
<s> let this opportunity be conceded to me of acknowledging that i have what a scotch philosopher characteristically terms a passion for reforming the world what passion incited him to write and publish his book he omits to explain <\s>
<s> for my part i had rather be damned with plato and lord bacon than go to heaven with paley and malthus <\s>
<s> but it is a mistake to suppose that i dedicate my poetical compositions solely to the direct enforcement of reform or that i consider them in any degree as containing a reasoned system on the theory of human life <\s>
<s> didactic poetry is my abhorrence nothing can be equally well expressed in prose that is not tedious and supererogatory in verse <\s>
<s> my purpose has hitherto been simply to familiarise the highly refined imagination of the more select classes of poetical readers with beautiful idealisms of moral excellence aware that until the mind can love and admire and trust and hope and endure reasoned principles of moral conduct are seeds cast upon the highway of life which the unconscious passenger tramples into dust although they would bear the harvest of his happiness <\s>
<s> should i live to accomplish what i purpose that is produce a systematical history of what appear to me to be the genuine elements of human society let not the advocates of injustice and superstition flatter themselves that i should take aeschylus rather than plato as my model <\s>

<s> such a system would have amounted to a resignation of those claims to preference over their competitors which incited the composition <\s>
<s> the agamemnonian story was exhibited on the athenian theatre with as many variations as dramas <\s>
<s> i have presumed to employ a similar license <\s>
<s> the prometheus unbound of aeschylus supposed the reconciliation of jupiter with his victim as the price of the disclosure of the danger threatened to his empire by the consummation of his marriage with thetis <\s>
<s> thetis according to this view of the subject was given in marriage to peleus and prometheus by the permission of jupiter delivered from his captivity by hercules <\s>
<s> had i framed my story on this model i should have done no more than have attempted to restore the lost drama of aeschylus an ambition which if my preference to this mode of treating the subject had incited me to cherish the recollection of the high comparison such an attempt would challenge might well abate <\s>
<s> but in truth i was averse from a catastrophe so feeble as that of reconciling the champion with the oppressor of mankind <\s>
<s> the moral interest of the fable which is so powerfully sustained by the sufferings and endurance of prometheus would be annihilated if we could conceive of him as unsaying his high language and quailing before his successful and perfidious adversary <\s>
<s> the only imaginary being resembling in any degree prometheus is satan and prometheus is in my judgement a more poetical character than satan because in addition to courage and majesty and firm and patient opposition to omnipotent force he is susceptible of being described as exempt from the taints of ambition envy revenge and a desire for personal aggrandisement which in the hero of paradise lost interfere with the interest <\s>
<s> the character of satan engenders in the mind a pernicious casuistry which leads us to weigh his faults with his wrongs and to excuse the former because the latter exceed all measure <\s>
<s> in the minds of those who consider that magnificent fiction with a religious feeling it engenders something worse <\s>
<s> but prometheus is as it were the type of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature impelled by the purest and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends <\s>
<s> this poem was chiefly written upon the mountainous ruins of the baths of caracalla among the flowery glades and thickets of odoriferous blossoming trees which are extended in ever winding labyrinths upon its immense platforms and dizzy arches suspended in the air <\s>
<s> the bright blue sky of rome and the effect of the vigorous awakening spring in that divinest climate and the new life with which it drenches the spirits even to intoxication were the inspiration of this drama <\s>
<s> the imagery which i have employed will be found in many instances to have been drawn from the operations of the human mind or from those external actions by which they are expressed <\s>
<s> this is unusual in modern poetry although dante and shakespeare are full of instances of the same kind dante indeed more than any other poet and with greater success <\s>
<s> but the greek poets as writers to whom no resource of awakening the sympathy of their contemporaries was unknown were in the habitual use of this power and it is the study of their works since a higher merit would probably be denied me to which i am willing that my readers should impute this singularity <\s>
<s> one word is due in candour to the degree in which the study of contemporary writings may have tinged my composition for such has been a topic of censure with regard to poems far more popular and indeed more deservedly popular than mine <\s>
<s> it is impossible that any one who inhabits the same age with such writers as those who stand in the foremost ranks of our own can conscientiously assure himself that his language and tone of thought may not have been modified by the study of the productions of those extraordinary intellects <\s>
<s> it is true that not the spirit of their genius but the forms in which it has manifested itself are due less to the peculiarities of their own minds than to the peculiarity of the moral and intellectual condition of the minds among which they have been produced <\s>
<s> thus a number of writers possess the form whilst they want the spirit of those whom it is alleged they imitate because the former is the endowment of the age in which they live and the latter must be the uncommunicated lightning of their own mind <\s>
<s> the peculiar style of intense and comprehensive imagery which distinguishes the modern literature of england has not been as a general power the product of the imitation of any particular writer <\s>
<s> the mass of capabilities remains at every period materially the same the circumstances which awaken it to action perpetually change <\s>
<s> if england were divided into forty republics each equal in population and extent to athens there is no reason to suppose but that under institutions not more perfect than those of athens each would produce philosophers and poets equal to those who if we except shakespeare have never been surpassed <\s>
<s> we owe the great writers of the golden age of our literature to that fervid awakening of the public mind which shook to dust the oldest and most oppressive form of the christian religion <\s>

<s> thetis according to this view of the subject was given in marriage to peleus and prometheus by the permission of jupiter delivered from his captivity by hercules <\s>
<s> had i framed my story on this model i should have done no more than have attempted to restore the lost drama of aeschylus an ambition which if my preference to this mode of treating the subject had incited me to cherish the recollection of the high comparison such an attempt would challenge might well abate <\s>
<s> but in truth i was averse from a catastrophe so feeble as that of reconciling the champion with the oppressor of mankind <\s>
<s> the moral interest of the fable which is so powerfully sustained by the sufferings and endurance of prometheus would be annihilated if we could conceive of him as unsaying his high language and quailing before his successful and perfidious adversary <\s>
<s> the only imaginary being resembling in any degree prometheus is satan and prometheus is in my judgement a more poetical character than satan because in addition to courage and majesty and firm and patient opposition to omnipotent force he is susceptible of being described as exempt from the taints of ambition envy revenge and a desire for personal aggrandisement which in the hero of paradise lost interfere with the interest <\s>
<s> the character of satan engenders in the mind a pernicious casuistry which leads us to weigh his faults with his wrongs and to excuse the former because the latter exceed all measure <\s>
<s> in the minds of those who consider that magnificent fiction with a religious feeling it engenders something worse <\s>
<s> but prometheus is as it were the type of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature impelled by the purest and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends <\s>
<s> this poem was chiefly written upon the mountainous ruins of the baths of caracalla among the flowery glades and thickets of odoriferous blossoming trees which are extended in ever winding labyrinths upon its immense platforms and dizzy arches suspended in the air <\s>
<s> the bright blue sky of rome and the effect of the vigorous awakening spring in that divinest climate and the new life with which it drenches the spirits even to intoxication were the inspiration of this drama <\s>
<s> the imagery which i have employed will be found in many instances to have been drawn from the operations of the human mind or from those external actions by which they are expressed <\s>
<s> this is unusual in modern poetry although dante and shakespeare are full of instances of the same kind dante indeed more than any other poet and with greater success <\s>
<s> but the greek poets as writers to whom no resource of awakening the sympathy of their contemporaries was unknown were in the habitual use of this power and it is the study of their works since a higher merit would probably be denied me to which i am willing that my readers should impute this singularity <\s>
<s> one word is due in candour to the degree in which the study of contemporary writings may have tinged my composition for such has been a topic of censure with regard to poems far more popular and indeed more deservedly popular than mine <\s>
<s> it is impossible that any one who inhabits the same age with such writers as those who stand in the foremost ranks of our own can conscientiously assure himself that his language and tone of thought may not have been modified by the study of the productions of those extraordinary intellects <\s>
<s> it is true that not the spirit of their genius but the forms in which it has manifested itself are due less to the peculiarities of their own minds than to the peculiarity of the moral and intellectual condition of the minds among which they have been produced <\s>
<s> thus a number of writers possess the form whilst they want the spirit of those whom it is alleged they imitate because the former is the endowment of the age in which they live and the latter must be the uncommunicated lightning of their own mind <\s>
<s> the peculiar style of intense and comprehensive imagery which distinguishes the modern literature of england has not been as a general power the product of the imitation of any particular writer <\s>
<s> the mass of capabilities remains at every period materially the same the circumstances which awaken it to action perpetually change <\s>
<s> if england were divided into forty republics each equal in population and extent to athens there is no reason to suppose but that under institutions not more perfect than those of athens each would produce philosophers and poets equal to those who if we except shakespeare have never been surpassed <\s>
<s> we owe the great writers of the golden age of our literature to that fervid awakening of the public mind which shook to dust the oldest and most oppressive form of the christian religion <\s>
<s> we owe milton to the progress and development of the same spirit the sacred milton was let it ever be remembered a republican and a bold inquirer into morals and religion <\s>
<s> the great writers of our own age are we have reason to suppose the companions and forerunners of some unimagined change in our social condition or the opinions which cement it <\s>
<s> the cloud of mind is discharging its collected lightning and the equilibrium between institutions and opinions is now restoring or is about to be restored <\s>
<s> as to imitation poetry is a mimetic art <\s>
<s> it creates but it creates by combination and representation <\s>
<s> poetical abstractions are beautiful and new not because the portions of which they are composed had no previous existence in the mind of man or in nature but because the whole produced by their combination has some intelligible and beautiful analogy with those sources of emotion and thought and with the contemporary condition of them one great poet is a masterpiece of nature which another not only ought to study but must study <\s>
<s> he might as wisely and as easily determine that his mind should no longer be the mirror of all that is lovely in the visible universe as exclude from his contemplation the beautiful which exists in the writings of a great contemporary <\s>
<s> the pretence of doing it would be a presumption in any but the greatest the effect even in him would be strained unnatural and ineffectual <\s>
<s> a poet is the combined product of such internal powers as modify the nature of others and of such external influences as excite and sustain these powers he is not one but both <\s>
<s> every man's mind is in this respect modified by all the objects of nature and art by every word and every suggestion which he ever admitted to act upon his consciousness it is the mirror upon which all forms are reflected and in which they compose one form <\s>
<s> poets not otherwise than philosophers painters sculptors and musicians are in one sense the creators and in another the creations of their age <\s>
<s> from this subjection the loftiest do not escape <\s>
<s> there is a similarity between homer and hesiod between aeschylus and euripides between virgil and horace between dante and petrarch between shakespeare and fletcher between dryden and pope each has a generic resemblance under which their specific distinctions are arranged <\s>
<s> if this similarity be the result of imitation i am willing to confess that i have imitated <\s>
<s> let this opportunity be conceded to me of acknowledging that i have what a scotch philosopher characteristically terms a passion for reforming the world what passion incited him to write and publish his book he omits to explain <\s>
<s> for my part i had rather be damned with plato and lord bacon than go to heaven with paley and malthus <\s>
<s> but it is a mistake to suppose that i dedicate my poetical compositions solely to the direct enforcement of reform or that i consider them in any degree as containing a reasoned system on the theory of human life <\s>
<s> didactic poetry is my abhorrence nothing can be equally well expressed in prose that is not tedious and supererogatory in verse <\s>
<s> my purpose has hitherto been simply to familiarise the highly refined imagination of the more select classes of poetical readers with beautiful idealisms of moral excellence aware that until the mind can love and admire and trust and hope and endure reasoned principles of moral conduct are seeds cast upon the highway of life which the unconscious passenger tramples into dust although they would bear the harvest of his happiness <\s>
<s> should i live to accomplish what i purpose that is produce a systematical history of what appear to me to be the genuine elements of human society let not the advocates of injustice and superstition flatter themselves that i should take aeschylus rather than plato as my model <\s>

<s> the greek tragic writers in selecting as their subject any portion of their national history or mythology employed in their treatment of it a certain arbitrary discretion <\s>
<s> they by no means conceived themselves bound to adhere to the common interpretation or to imitate in story as in title their rivals and predecessors <\s>
<s> such a system would have amounted to a resignation of those claims to preference over their competitors which incited the composition <\s>
<s> the agamemnonian story was exhibited on the athenian theatre with as many variations as dramas <\s>
<s> i have presumed to employ a similar license <\s>
<s> the prometheus unbound of aeschylus supposed the reconciliation of jupiter with his victim as the price of the disclosure of the danger threatened to his empire by the consummation of his marriage with thetis <\s>
<s> thetis according to this view of the subject was given in marriage to peleus and prometheus by the permission of jupiter delivered from his captivity by hercules <\s>
<s> had i framed my story on this model i should have done no more than have attempted to restore the lost drama of aeschylus an ambition which if my preference to this mode of treating the subject had incited me to cherish the recollection of the high comparison such an attempt would challenge might well abate <\s>
<s> but in truth i was averse from a catastrophe so feeble as that of reconciling the champion with the oppressor of mankind <\s>
<s> the moral interest of the fable which is so powerfully sustained by the sufferings and endurance of prometheus would be annihilated if we could conceive of him as unsaying his high language and quailing before his successful and perfidious adversary <\s>
<s> the only imaginary being resembling in any degree prometheus is satan and prometheus is in my judgement a more poetical character than satan because in addition to courage and majesty and firm and patient opposition to omnipotent force he is susceptible of being described as exempt from the taints of ambition envy revenge and a desire for personal aggrandisement which in the hero of paradise lost interfere with the interest <\s>
<s> the character of satan engenders in the mind a pernicious casuistry which leads us to weigh his faults with his wrongs and to excuse the former because the latter exceed all measure <\s>
<s> in the minds of those who consider that magnificent fiction with a religious feeling it engenders something worse <\s>
<s> but prometheus is as it were the type of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature impelled by the purest and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends <\s>
<s> this poem was chiefly written upon the mountainous ruins of the baths of caracalla among the flowery glades and thickets of odoriferous blossoming trees which are extended in ever winding labyrinths upon its immense platforms and dizzy arches suspended in the air <\s>
<s> the bright blue sky of rome and the effect of the vigorous awakening spring in that divinest climate and the new life with which it drenches the spirits even to intoxication were the inspiration of this drama <\s>
<s> the imagery which i have employed will be found in many instances to have been drawn from the operations of the human mind or from those external actions by which they are expressed <\s>
<s> this is unusual in modern poetry although dante and shakespeare are full of instances of the same kind dante indeed more than any other poet and with greater success <\s>
<s> but the greek poets as writers to whom no resource of awakening the sympathy of their contemporaries was unknown were in the habitual use of this power and it is the study of their works since a higher merit would probably be denied me to which i am willing that my readers should impute this singularity <\s>
<s> one word is due in candour to the degree in which the study of contemporary writings may have tinged my composition for such has been a topic of censure with regard to poems far more popular and indeed more deservedly popular than mine <\s>
<s> it is impossible that any one who inhabits the same age with such writers as those who stand in the foremost ranks of our own can conscientiously assure himself that his language and tone of thought may not have been modified by the study of the productions of those extraordinary intellects <\s>
<s> it is true that not the spirit of their genius but the forms in which it has manifested itself are due less to the peculiarities of their own minds than to the peculiarity of the moral and intellectual condition of the minds among which they have been produced <\s>
<s> thus a number of writers possess the form whilst they want the spirit of those whom it is alleged they imitate because the former is the endowment of the age in which they live and the latter must be the uncommunicated lightning of their own mind <\s>
<s> the peculiar style of intense and comprehensive imagery which distinguishes the modern literature of england has not been as a general power the product of the imitation of any particular writer <\s>
<s> the mass of capabilities remains at every period materially the same the circumstances which awaken it to action perpetually change <\s>
<s> if england were divided into forty republics each equal in population and extent to athens there is no reason to suppose but that under institutions not more perfect than those of athens each would produce philosophers and poets equal to those who if we except shakespeare have never been surpassed <\s>
<s> we owe the great writers of the golden age of our literature to that fervid awakening of the public mind which shook to dust the oldest and most oppressive form of the christian religion <\s>
<s> we owe milton to the progress and development of the same spirit the sacred milton was let it ever be remembered a republican and a bold inquirer into morals and religion <\s>
<s> the great writers of our own age are we have reason to suppose the companions and forerunners of some unimagined change in our social condition or the opinions which cement it <\s>
<s> the cloud of mind is discharging its collected lightning and the equilibrium between institutions and opinions is now restoring or is about to be restored <\s>
<s> as to imitation poetry is a mimetic art <\s>
<s> it creates but it creates by combination and representation <\s>
<s> poetical abstractions are beautiful and new not because the portions of which they are composed had no previous existence in the mind of man or in nature but because the whole produced by their combination has some intelligible and beautiful analogy with those sources of emotion and thought and with the contemporary condition of them one great poet is a masterpiece of nature which another not only ought to study but must study <\s>
<s> he might as wisely and as easily determine that his mind should no longer be the mirror of all that is lovely in the visible universe as exclude from his contemplation the beautiful which exists in the writings of a great contemporary <\s>
<s> the pretence of doing it would be a presumption in any but the greatest the effect even in him would be strained unnatural and ineffectual <\s>
<s> a poet is the combined product of such internal powers as modify the nature of others and of such external influences as excite and sustain these powers he is not one but both <\s>
<s> every man's mind is in this respect modified by all the objects of nature and art by every word and every suggestion which he ever admitted to act upon his consciousness it is the mirror upon which all forms are reflected and in which they compose one form <\s>
<s> poets not otherwise than philosophers painters sculptors and musicians are in one sense the creators and in another the creations of their age <\s>
<s> from this subjection the loftiest do not escape <\s>
<s> there is a similarity between homer and hesiod between aeschylus and euripides between virgil and horace between dante and petrarch between shakespeare and fletcher between dryden and pope each has a generic resemblance under which their specific distinctions are arranged <\s>
<s> if this similarity be the result of imitation i am willing to confess that i have imitated <\s>
<s> let this opportunity be conceded to me of acknowledging that i have what a scotch philosopher characteristically terms a passion for reforming the world what passion incited him to write and publish his book he omits to explain <\s>
<s> for my part i had rather be damned with plato and lord bacon than go to heaven with paley and malthus <\s>
<s> but it is a mistake to suppose that i dedicate my poetical compositions solely to the direct enforcement of reform or that i consider them in any degree as containing a reasoned system on the theory of human life <\s>
<s> didactic poetry is my abhorrence nothing can be equally well expressed in prose that is not tedious and supererogatory in verse <\s>
<s> my purpose has hitherto been simply to familiarise the highly refined imagination of the more select classes of poetical readers with beautiful idealisms of moral excellence aware that until the mind can love and admire and trust and hope and endure reasoned principles of moral conduct are seeds cast upon the highway of life which the unconscious passenger tramples into dust although they would bear the harvest of his happiness <\s>
<s> should i live to accomplish what i purpose that is produce a systematical history of what appear to me to be the genuine elements of human society let not the advocates of injustice and superstition flatter themselves that i should take aeschylus rather than plato as my model <\s>
<s> the having spoken of myself with unaffected freedom will need little apology with the candid and let the uncandid consider that they injure me less than their own hearts and minds by misrepresentation <\s>
<s> whatever talents a person may possess to amuse and instruct others be they ever so inconsiderable he is yet bound to exert them if his attempt be ineffectual let the punishment of an unaccomplished purpose have been sufficient let none trouble themselves to heap the dust of oblivion upon his efforts the pile they raise will betray his grave which might otherwise have been unknown <\s>

<s> such a system would have amounted to a resignation of those claims to preference over their competitors which incited the composition <\s>

<s> the prometheus unbound of aeschylus supposed the reconciliation of jupiter with his victim as the price of the disclosure of the danger threatened to his empire by the consummation of his marriage with thetis <\s>
<s> thetis according to this view of the subject was given in marriage to peleus and prometheus by the permission of jupiter delivered from his captivity by hercules <\s>
<s> had i framed my story on this model i should have done no more than have attempted to restore the lost drama of aeschylus an ambition which if my preference to this mode of treating the subject had incited me to cherish the recollection of the high comparison such an attempt would challenge might well abate <\s>
<s> but in truth i was averse from a catastrophe so feeble as that of reconciling the champion with the oppressor of mankind <\s>
<s> the moral interest of the fable which is so powerfully sustained by the sufferings and endurance of prometheus would be annihilated if we could conceive of him as unsaying his high language and quailing before his successful and perfidious adversary <\s>
<s> the only imaginary being resembling in any degree prometheus is satan and prometheus is in my judgement a more poetical character than satan because in addition to courage and majesty and firm and patient opposition to omnipotent force he is susceptible of being described as exempt from the taints of ambition envy revenge and a desire for personal aggrandisement which in the hero of paradise lost interfere with the interest <\s>
<s> the character of satan engenders in the mind a pernicious casuistry which leads us to weigh his faults with his wrongs and to excuse the former because the latter exceed all measure <\s>
<s> in the minds of those who consider that magnificent fiction with a religious feeling it engenders something worse <\s>
<s> but prometheus is as it were the type of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature impelled by the purest and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends <\s>
<s> this poem was chiefly written upon the mountainous ruins of the baths of caracalla among the flowery glades and thickets of odoriferous blossoming trees which are extended in ever winding labyrinths upon its immense platforms and dizzy arches suspended in the air <\s>
<s> the bright blue sky of rome and the effect of the vigorous awakening spring in that divinest climate and the new life with which it drenches the spirits even to intoxication were the inspiration of this drama <\s>
<s> the imagery which i have employed will be found in many instances to have been drawn from the operations of the human mind or from those external actions by which they are expressed <\s>
<s> this is unusual in modern poetry although dante and shakespeare are full of instances of the same kind dante indeed more than any other poet and with greater success <\s>
<s> but the greek poets as writers to whom no resource of awakening the sympathy of their contemporaries was unknown were in the habitual use of this power and it is the study of their works since a higher merit would probably be denied me to which i am willing that my readers should impute this singularity <\s>
<s> one word is due in candour to the degree in which the study of contemporary writings may have tinged my composition for such has been a topic of censure with regard to poems far more popular and indeed more deservedly popular than mine <\s>
<s> it is impossible that any one who inhabits the same age with such writers as those who stand in the foremost ranks of our own can conscientiously assure himself that his language and tone of thought may not have been modified by the study of the productions of those extraordinary intellects <\s>
<s> it is true that not the spirit of their genius but the forms in which it has manifested itself are due less to the peculiarities of their own minds than to the peculiarity of the moral and intellectual condition of the minds among which they have been produced <\s>
<s> thus a number of writers possess the form whilst they want the spirit of those whom it is alleged they imitate because the former is the endowment of the age in which they live and the latter must be the uncommunicated lightning of their own mind <\s>
<s> the peculiar style of intense and comprehensive imagery which distinguishes the modern literature of england has not been as a general power the product of the imitation of any particular writer <\s>
<s> the mass of capabilities remains at every period materially the same the circumstances which awaken it to action perpetually change <\s>
<s> if england were divided into forty republics each equal in population and extent to athens there is no reason to suppose but that under institutions not more perfect than those of athens each would produce philosophers and poets equal to those who if we except shakespeare have never been surpassed <\s>
<s> we owe the great writers of the golden age of our literature to that fervid awakening of the public mind which shook to dust the oldest and most oppressive form of the christian religion <\s>
<s> we owe milton to the progress and development of the same spirit the sacred milton was let it ever be remembered a republican and a bold inquirer into morals and religion <\s>
<s> the great writers of our own age are we have reason to suppose the companions and forerunners of some unimagined change in our social condition or the opinions which cement it <\s>
<s> the cloud of mind is discharging its collected lightning and the equilibrium between institutions and opinions is now restoring or is about to be restored <\s>
<s> as to imitation poetry is a mimetic art <\s>
<s> it creates but it creates by combination and representation <\s>
<s> poetical abstractions are beautiful and new not because the portions of which they are composed had no previous existence in the mind of man or in nature but because the whole produced by their combination has some intelligible and beautiful analogy with those sources of emotion and thought and with the contemporary condition of them one great poet is a masterpiece of nature which another not only ought to study but must study <\s>
<s> he might as wisely and as easily determine that his mind should no longer be the mirror of all that is lovely in the visible universe as exclude from his contemplation the beautiful which exists in the writings of a great contemporary <\s>
<s> the pretence of doing it would be a presumption in any but the greatest the effect even in him would be strained unnatural and ineffectual <\s>
<s> a poet is the combined product of such internal powers as modify the nature of others and of such external influences as excite and sustain these powers he is not one but both <\s>
<s> every man's mind is in this respect modified by all the objects of nature and art by every word and every suggestion which he ever admitted to act upon his consciousness it is the mirror upon which all forms are reflected and in which they compose one form <\s>
<s> poets not otherwise than philosophers painters sculptors and musicians are in one sense the creators and in another the creations of their age <\s>
<s> from this subjection the loftiest do not escape <\s>
<s> there is a similarity between homer and hesiod between aeschylus and euripides between virgil and horace between dante and petrarch between shakespeare and fletcher between dryden and pope each has a generic resemblance under which their specific distinctions are arranged <\s>

<s> had i framed my story on this model i should have done no more than have attempted to restore the lost drama of aeschylus an ambition which if my preference to this mode of treating the subject had incited me to cherish the recollection of the high comparison such an attempt would challenge might well abate <\s>

<s> the moral interest of the fable which is so powerfully sustained by the sufferings and endurance of prometheus would be annihilated if we could conceive of him as unsaying his high language and quailing before his successful and perfidious adversary <\s>
<s> the only imaginary being resembling in any degree prometheus is satan and prometheus is in my judgement a more poetical character than satan because in addition to courage and majesty and firm and patient opposition to omnipotent force he is susceptible of being described as exempt from the taints of ambition envy revenge and a desire for personal aggrandisement which in the hero of paradise lost interfere with the interest <\s>
<s> the character of satan engenders in the mind a pernicious casuistry which leads us to weigh his faults with his wrongs and to excuse the former because the latter exceed all measure <\s>
<s> in the minds of those who consider that magnificent fiction with a religious feeling it engenders something worse <\s>
<s> but prometheus is as it were the type of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature impelled by the purest and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends <\s>
<s> this poem was chiefly written upon the mountainous ruins of the baths of caracalla among the flowery glades and thickets of odoriferous blossoming trees which are extended in ever winding labyrinths upon its immense platforms and dizzy arches suspended in the air <\s>
<s> the bright blue sky of rome and the effect of the vigorous awakening spring in that divinest climate and the new life with which it drenches the spirits even to intoxication were the inspiration of this drama <\s>
<s> the imagery which i have employed will be found in many instances to have been drawn from the operations of the human mind or from those external actions by which they are expressed <\s>
<s> this is unusual in modern poetry although dante and shakespeare are full of instances of the same kind dante indeed more than any other poet and with greater success <\s>
<s> but the greek poets as writers to whom no resource of awakening the sympathy of their contemporaries was unknown were in the habitual use of this power and it is the study of their works since a higher merit would probably be denied me to which i am willing that my readers should impute this singularity <\s>
<s> one word is due in candour to the degree in which the study of contemporary writings may have tinged my composition for such has been a topic of censure with regard to poems far more popular and indeed more deservedly popular than mine <\s>
<s> it is impossible that any one who inhabits the same age with such writers as those who stand in the foremost ranks of our own can conscientiously assure himself that his language and tone of thought may not have been modified by the study of the productions of those extraordinary intellects <\s>
<s> it is true that not the spirit of their genius but the forms in which it has manifested itself are due less to the peculiarities of their own minds than to the peculiarity of the moral and intellectual condition of the minds among which they have been produced <\s>
<s> thus a number of writers possess the form whilst they want the spirit of those whom it is alleged they imitate because the former is the endowment of the age in which they live and the latter must be the uncommunicated lightning of their own mind <\s>
<s> the peculiar style of intense and comprehensive imagery which distinguishes the modern literature of england has not been as a general power the product of the imitation of any particular writer <\s>
<s> the mass of capabilities remains at every period materially the same the circumstances which awaken it to action perpetually change <\s>
<s> if england were divided into forty republics each equal in population and extent to athens there is no reason to suppose but that under institutions not more perfect than those of athens each would produce philosophers and poets equal to those who if we except shakespeare have never been surpassed <\s>
<s> we owe the great writers of the golden age of our literature to that fervid awakening of the public mind which shook to dust the oldest and most oppressive form of the christian religion <\s>
<s> we owe milton to the progress and development of the same spirit the sacred milton was let it ever be remembered a republican and a bold inquirer into morals and religion <\s>
<s> the great writers of our own age are we have reason to suppose the companions and forerunners of some unimagined change in our social condition or the opinions which cement it <\s>
<s> the cloud of mind is discharging its collected lightning and the equilibrium between institutions and opinions is now restoring or is about to be restored <\s>
<s> as to imitation poetry is a mimetic art <\s>
<s> it creates but it creates by combination and representation <\s>
<s> poetical abstractions are beautiful and new not because the portions of which they are composed had no previous existence in the mind of man or in nature but because the whole produced by their combination has some intelligible and beautiful analogy with those sources of emotion and thought and with the contemporary condition of them one great poet is a masterpiece of nature which another not only ought to study but must study <\s>
<s> he might as wisely and as easily determine that his mind should no longer be the mirror of all that is lovely in the visible universe as exclude from his contemplation the beautiful which exists in the writings of a great contemporary <\s>
<s> the pretence of doing it would be a presumption in any but the greatest the effect even in him would be strained unnatural and ineffectual <\s>
<s> a poet is the combined product of such internal powers as modify the nature of others and of such external influences as excite and sustain these powers he is not one but both <\s>
<s> every man's mind is in this respect modified by all the objects of nature and art by every word and every suggestion which he ever admitted to act upon his consciousness it is the mirror upon which all forms are reflected and in which they compose one form <\s>
<s> poets not otherwise than philosophers painters sculptors and musicians are in one sense the creators and in another the creations of their age <\s>
<s> from this subjection the loftiest do not escape <\s>
<s> there is a similarity between homer and hesiod between aeschylus and euripides between virgil and horace between dante and petrarch between shakespeare and fletcher between dryden and pope each has a generic resemblance under which their specific distinctions are arranged <\s>
<s> if this similarity be the result of imitation i am willing to confess that i have imitated <\s>
<s> let this opportunity be conceded to me of acknowledging that i have what a scotch philosopher characteristically terms a passion for reforming the world what passion incited him to write and publish his book he omits to explain <\s>
<s> for my part i had rather be damned with plato and lord bacon than go to heaven with paley and malthus <\s>
<s> but it is a mistake to suppose that i dedicate my poetical compositions solely to the direct enforcement of reform or that i consider them in any degree as containing a reasoned system on the theory of human life <\s>
<s> didactic poetry is my abhorrence nothing can be equally well expressed in prose that is not tedious and supererogatory in verse <\s>
<s> my purpose has hitherto been simply to familiarise the highly refined imagination of the more select classes of poetical readers with beautiful idealisms of moral excellence aware that until the mind can love and admire and trust and hope and endure reasoned principles of moral conduct are seeds cast upon the highway of life which the unconscious passenger tramples into dust although they would bear the harvest of his happiness <\s>
<s> should i live to accomplish what i purpose that is produce a systematical history of what appear to me to be the genuine elements of human society let not the advocates of injustice and superstition flatter themselves that i should take aeschylus rather than plato as my model <\s>

<s> such a system would have amounted to a resignation of those claims to preference over their competitors which incited the composition <\s>
<s> the agamemnonian story was exhibited on the athenian theatre with as many variations as dramas <\s>
<s> i have presumed to employ a similar license <\s>
<s> the prometheus unbound of aeschylus supposed the reconciliation of jupiter with his victim as the price of the disclosure of the danger threatened to his empire by the consummation of his marriage with thetis <\s>
<s> thetis according to this view of the subject was given in marriage to peleus and prometheus by the permission of jupiter delivered from his captivity by hercules <\s>
<s> had i framed my story on this model i should have done no more than have attempted to restore the lost drama of aeschylus an ambition which if my preference to this mode of treating the subject had incited me to cherish the recollection of the high comparison such an attempt would challenge might well abate <\s>
<s> but in truth i was averse from a catastrophe so feeble as that of reconciling the champion with the oppressor of mankind <\s>
<s> the moral interest of the fable which is so powerfully sustained by the sufferings and endurance of prometheus would be annihilated if we could conceive of him as unsaying his high language and quailing before his successful and perfidious adversary <\s>
<s> the only imaginary being resembling in any degree prometheus is satan and prometheus is in my judgement a more poetical character than satan because in addition to courage and majesty and firm and patient opposition to omnipotent force he is susceptible of being described as exempt from the taints of ambition envy revenge and a desire for personal aggrandisement which in the hero of paradise lost interfere with the interest <\s>
<s> the character of satan engenders in the mind a pernicious casuistry which leads us to weigh his faults with his wrongs and to excuse the former because the latter exceed all measure <\s>
<s> in the minds of those who consider that magnificent fiction with a religious feeling it engenders something worse <\s>
<s> but prometheus is as it were the type of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature impelled by the purest and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends <\s>
<s> this poem was chiefly written upon the mountainous ruins of the baths of caracalla among the flowery glades and thickets of odoriferous blossoming trees which are extended in ever winding labyrinths upon its immense platforms and dizzy arches suspended in the air <\s>
<s> the bright blue sky of rome and the effect of the vigorous awakening spring in that divinest climate and the new life with which it drenches the spirits even to intoxication were the inspiration of this drama <\s>
<s> the imagery which i have employed will be found in many instances to have been drawn from the operations of the human mind or from those external actions by which they are expressed <\s>
<s> this is unusual in modern poetry although dante and shakespeare are full of instances of the same kind dante indeed more than any other poet and with greater success <\s>
<s> but the greek poets as writers to whom no resource of awakening the sympathy of their contemporaries was unknown were in the habitual use of this power and it is the study of their works since a higher merit would probably be denied me to which i am willing that my readers should impute this singularity <\s>
<s> one word is due in candour to the degree in which the study of contemporary writings may have tinged my composition for such has been a topic of censure with regard to poems far more popular and indeed more deservedly popular than mine <\s>
<s> it is impossible that any one who inhabits the same age with such writers as those who stand in the foremost ranks of our own can conscientiously assure himself that his language and tone of thought may not have been modified by the study of the productions of those extraordinary intellects <\s>
<s> it is true that not the spirit of their genius but the forms in which it has manifested itself are due less to the peculiarities of their own minds than to the peculiarity of the moral and intellectual condition of the minds among which they have been produced <\s>
<s> thus a number of writers possess the form whilst they want the spirit of those whom it is alleged they imitate because the former is the endowment of the age in which they live and the latter must be the uncommunicated lightning of their own mind <\s>
<s> the peculiar style of intense and comprehensive imagery which distinguishes the modern literature of england has not been as a general power the product of the imitation of any particular writer <\s>
<s> the mass of capabilities remains at every period materially the same the circumstances which awaken it to action perpetually change <\s>
<s> if england were divided into forty republics each equal in population and extent to athens there is no reason to suppose but that under institutions not more perfect than those of athens each would produce philosophers and poets equal to those who if we except shakespeare have never been surpassed <\s>
<s> we owe the great writers of the golden age of our literature to that fervid awakening of the public mind which shook to dust the oldest and most oppressive form of the christian religion <\s>

<s> thetis according to this view of the subject was given in marriage to peleus and prometheus by the permission of jupiter delivered from his captivity by hercules <\s>
<s> had i framed my story on this model i should have done no more than have attempted to restore the lost drama of aeschylus an ambition which if my preference to this mode of treating the subject had incited me to cherish the recollection of the high comparison such an attempt would challenge might well abate <\s>
<s> but in truth i was averse from a catastrophe so feeble as that of reconciling the champion with the oppressor of mankind <\s>
<s> the moral interest of the fable which is so powerfully sustained by the sufferings and endurance of prometheus would be annihilated if we could conceive of him as unsaying his high language and quailing before his successful and perfidious adversary <\s>
<s> the only imaginary being resembling in any degree prometheus is satan and prometheus is in my judgement a more poetical character than satan because in addition to courage and majesty and firm and patient opposition to omnipotent force he is susceptible of being described as exempt from the taints of ambition envy revenge and a desire for personal aggrandisement which in the hero of paradise lost interfere with the interest <\s>
<s> the character of satan engenders in the mind a pernicious casuistry which leads us to weigh his faults with his wrongs and to excuse the former because the latter exceed all measure <\s>
<s> in the minds of those who consider that magnificent fiction with a religious feeling it engenders something worse <\s>
<s> but prometheus is as it were the type of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature impelled by the purest and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends <\s>
<s> this poem was chiefly written upon the mountainous ruins of the baths of caracalla among the flowery glades and thickets of odoriferous blossoming trees which are extended in ever winding labyrinths upon its immense platforms and dizzy arches suspended in the air <\s>
<s> the bright blue sky of rome and the effect of the vigorous awakening spring in that divinest climate and the new life with which it drenches the spirits even to intoxication were the inspiration of this drama <\s>
<s> the imagery which i have employed will be found in many instances to have been drawn from the operations of the human mind or from those external actions by which they are expressed <\s>
<s> this is unusual in modern poetry although dante and shakespeare are full of instances of the same kind dante indeed more than any other poet and with greater success <\s>
<s> but the greek poets as writers to whom no resource of awakening the sympathy of their contemporaries was unknown were in the habitual use of this power and it is the study of their works since a higher merit would probably be denied me to which i am willing that my readers should impute this singularity <\s>
<s> one word is due in candour to the degree in which the study of contemporary writings may have tinged my composition for such has been a topic of censure with regard to poems far more popular and indeed more deservedly popular than mine <\s>
<s> it is impossible that any one who inhabits the same age with such writers as those who stand in the foremost ranks of our own can conscientiously assure himself that his language and tone of thought may not have been modified by the study of the productions of those extraordinary intellects <\s>
<s> it is true that not the spirit of their genius but the forms in which it has manifested itself are due less to the peculiarities of their own minds than to the peculiarity of the moral and intellectual condition of the minds among which they have been produced <\s>
<s> thus a number of writers possess the form whilst they want the spirit of those whom it is alleged they imitate because the former is the endowment of the age in which they live and the latter must be the uncommunicated lightning of their own mind <\s>
<s> the peculiar style of intense and comprehensive imagery which distinguishes the modern literature of england has not been as a general power the product of the imitation of any particular writer <\s>
<s> the mass of capabilities remains at every period materially the same the circumstances which awaken it to action perpetually change <\s>
<s> if england were divided into forty republics each equal in population and extent to athens there is no reason to suppose but that under institutions not more perfect than those of athens each would produce philosophers and poets equal to those who if we except shakespeare have never been surpassed <\s>
<s> we owe the great writers of the golden age of our literature to that fervid awakening of the public mind which shook to dust the oldest and most oppressive form of the christian religion <\s>
<s> we owe milton to the progress and development of the same spirit the sacred milton was let it ever be remembered a republican and a bold inquirer into morals and religion <\s>
<s> the great writers of our own age are we have reason to suppose the companions and forerunners of some unimagined change in our social condition or the opinions which cement it <\s>
<s> the cloud of mind is discharging its collected lightning and the equilibrium between institutions and opinions is now restoring or is about to be restored <\s>
<s> as to imitation poetry is a mimetic art <\s>
<s> it creates but it creates by combination and representation <\s>
<s> poetical abstractions are beautiful and new not because the portions of which they are composed had no previous existence in the mind of man or in nature but because the whole produced by their combination has some intelligible and beautiful analogy with those sources of emotion and thought and with the contemporary condition of them one great poet is a masterpiece of nature which another not only ought to study but must study <\s>
<s> he might as wisely and as easily determine that his mind should no longer be the mirror of all that is lovely in the visible universe as exclude from his contemplation the beautiful which exists in the writings of a great contemporary <\s>
<s> the pretence of doing it would be a presumption in any but the greatest the effect even in him would be strained unnatural and ineffectual <\s>
<s> a poet is the combined product of such internal powers as modify the nature of others and of such external influences as excite and sustain these powers he is not one but both <\s>
<s> every man's mind is in this respect modified by all the objects of nature and art by every word and every suggestion which he ever admitted to act upon his consciousness it is the mirror upon which all forms are reflected and in which they compose one form <\s>
<s> poets not otherwise than philosophers painters sculptors and musicians are in one sense the creators and in another the creations of their age <\s>
<s> from this subjection the loftiest do not escape <\s>
<s> there is a similarity between homer and hesiod between aeschylus and euripides between virgil and horace between dante and petrarch between shakespeare and fletcher between dryden and pope each has a generic resemblance under which their specific distinctions are arranged <\s>
<s> if this similarity be the result of imitation i am willing to confess that i have imitated <\s>
<s> let this opportunity be conceded to me of acknowledging that i have what a scotch philosopher characteristically terms a passion for reforming the world what passion incited him to write and publish his book he omits to explain <\s>
<s> for my part i had rather be damned with plato and lord bacon than go to heaven with paley and malthus <\s>
<s> but it is a mistake to suppose that i dedicate my poetical compositions solely to the direct enforcement of reform or that i consider them in any degree as containing a reasoned system on the theory of human life <\s>
<s> didactic poetry is my abhorrence nothing can be equally well expressed in prose that is not tedious and supererogatory in verse <\s>
<s> my purpose has hitherto been simply to familiarise the highly refined imagination of the more select classes of poetical readers with beautiful idealisms of moral excellence aware that until the mind can love and admire and trust and hope and endure reasoned principles of moral conduct are seeds cast upon the highway of life which the unconscious passenger tramples into dust although they would bear the harvest of his happiness <\s>
<s> should i live to accomplish what i purpose that is produce a systematical history of what appear to me to be the genuine elements of human society let not the advocates of injustice and superstition flatter themselves that i should take aeschylus rather than plato as my model <\s>

<s> the greek tragic writers in selecting as their subject any portion of their national history or mythology employed in their treatment of it a certain arbitrary discretion <\s>
<s> they by no means conceived themselves bound to adhere to the common interpretation or to imitate in story as in title their rivals and predecessors <\s>
<s> such a system would have amounted to a resignation of those claims to preference over their competitors which incited the composition <\s>
<s> the agamemnonian story was exhibited on the athenian theatre with as many variations as dramas <\s>
<s> i have presumed to employ a similar license <\s>
<s> the prometheus unbound of aeschylus supposed the reconciliation of jupiter with his victim as the price of the disclosure of the danger threatened to his empire by the consummation of his marriage with thetis <\s>
<s> thetis according to this view of the subject was given in marriage to peleus and prometheus by the permission of jupiter delivered from his captivity by hercules <\s>
<s> had i framed my story on this model i should have done no more than have attempted to restore the lost drama of aeschylus an ambition which if my preference to this mode of treating the subject had incited me to cherish the recollection of the high comparison such an attempt would challenge might well abate <\s>
<s> but in truth i was averse from a catastrophe so feeble as that of reconciling the champion with the oppressor of mankind <\s>
<s> the moral interest of the fable which is so powerfully sustained by the sufferings and endurance of prometheus would be annihilated if we could conceive of him as unsaying his high language and quailing before his successful and perfidious adversary <\s>
<s> the only imaginary being resembling in any degree prometheus is satan and prometheus is in my judgement a more poetical character than satan because in addition to courage and majesty and firm and patient opposition to omnipotent force he is susceptible of being described as exempt from the taints of ambition envy revenge and a desire for personal aggrandisement which in the hero of paradise lost interfere with the interest <\s>
<s> the character of satan engenders in the mind a pernicious casuistry which leads us to weigh his faults with his wrongs and to excuse the former because the latter exceed all measure <\s>
<s> in the minds of those who consider that magnificent fiction with a religious feeling it engenders something worse <\s>
<s> but prometheus is as it were the type of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature impelled by the purest and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends <\s>
<s> this poem was chiefly written upon the mountainous ruins of the baths of caracalla among the flowery glades and thickets of odoriferous blossoming trees which are extended in ever winding labyrinths upon its immense platforms and dizzy arches suspended in the air <\s>
<s> the bright blue sky of rome and the effect of the vigorous awakening spring in that divinest climate and the new life with which it drenches the spirits even to intoxication were the inspiration of this drama <\s>
<s> the imagery which i have employed will be found in many instances to have been drawn from the operations of the human mind or from those external actions by which they are expressed <\s>
<s> this is unusual in modern poetry although dante and shakespeare are full of instances of the same kind dante indeed more than any other poet and with greater success <\s>
<s> but the greek poets as writers to whom no resource of awakening the sympathy of their contemporaries was unknown were in the habitual use of this power and it is the study of their works since a higher merit would probably be denied me to which i am willing that my readers should impute this singularity <\s>
<s> one word is due in candour to the degree in which the study of contemporary writings may have tinged my composition for such has been a topic of censure with regard to poems far more popular and indeed more deservedly popular than mine <\s>
<s> it is impossible that any one who inhabits the same age with such writers as those who stand in the foremost ranks of our own can conscientiously assure himself that his language and tone of thought may not have been modified by the study of the productions of those extraordinary intellects <\s>
<s> it is true that not the spirit of their genius but the forms in which it has manifested itself are due less to the peculiarities of their own minds than to the peculiarity of the moral and intellectual condition of the minds among which they have been produced <\s>
<s> thus a number of writers possess the form whilst they want the spirit of those whom it is alleged they imitate because the former is the endowment of the age in which they live and the latter must be the uncommunicated lightning of their own mind <\s>
<s> the peculiar style of intense and comprehensive imagery which distinguishes the modern literature of england has not been as a general power the product of the imitation of any particular writer <\s>
<s> the mass of capabilities remains at every period materially the same the circumstances which awaken it to action perpetually change <\s>
<s> if england were divided into forty republics each equal in population and extent to athens there is no reason to suppose but that under institutions not more perfect than those of athens each would produce philosophers and poets equal to those who if we except shakespeare have never been surpassed <\s>
<s> we owe the great writers of the golden age of our literature to that fervid awakening of the public mind which shook to dust the oldest and most oppressive form of the christian religion <\s>
<s> we owe milton to the progress and development of the same spirit the sacred milton was let it ever be remembered a republican and a bold inquirer into morals and religion <\s>
<s> the great writers of our own age are we have reason to suppose the companions and forerunners of some unimagined change in our social condition or the opinions which cement it <\s>
<s> the cloud of mind is discharging its collected lightning and the equilibrium between institutions and opinions is now restoring or is about to be restored <\s>
<s> as to imitation poetry is a mimetic art <\s>
<s> it creates but it creates by combination and representation <\s>
<s> poetical abstractions are beautiful and new not because the portions of which they are composed had no previous existence in the mind of man or in nature but because the whole produced by their combination has some intelligible and beautiful analogy with those sources of emotion and thought and with the contemporary condition of them one great poet is a masterpiece of nature which another not only ought to study but must study <\s>
<s> he might as wisely and as easily determine that his mind should no longer be the mirror of all that is lovely in the visible universe as exclude from his contemplation the beautiful which exists in the writings of a great contemporary <\s>
<s> the pretence of doing it would be a presumption in any but the greatest the effect even in him would be strained unnatural and ineffectual <\s>
<s> a poet is the combined product of such internal powers as modify the nature of others and of such external influences as excite and sustain these powers he is not one but both <\s>
<s> every man's mind is in this respect modified by all the objects of nature and art by every word and every suggestion which he ever admitted to act upon his consciousness it is the mirror upon which all forms are reflected and in which they compose one form <\s>
<s> poets not otherwise than philosophers painters sculptors and musicians are in one sense the creators and in another the creations of their age <\s>
<s> from this subjection the loftiest do not escape <\s>
<s> there is a similarity between homer and hesiod between aeschylus and euripides between virgil and horace between dante and petrarch between shakespeare and fletcher between dryden and pope each has a generic resemblance under which their specific distinctions are arranged <\s>
<s> if this similarity be the result of imitation i am willing to confess that i have imitated <\s>
<s> let this opportunity be conceded to me of acknowledging that i have what a scotch philosopher characteristically terms a passion for reforming the world what passion incited him to write and publish his book he omits to explain <\s>
<s> for my part i had rather be damned with plato and lord bacon than go to heaven with paley and malthus <\s>
<s> but it is a mistake to suppose that i dedicate my poetical compositions solely to the direct enforcement of reform or that i consider them in any degree as containing a reasoned system on the theory of human life <\s>
<s> didactic poetry is my abhorrence nothing can be equally well expressed in prose that is not tedious and supererogatory in verse <\s>
<s> my purpose has hitherto been simply to familiarise the highly refined imagination of the more select classes of poetical readers with beautiful idealisms of moral excellence aware that until the mind can love and admire and trust and hope and endure reasoned principles of moral conduct are seeds cast upon the highway of life which the unconscious passenger tramples into dust although they would bear the harvest of his happiness <\s>
<s> should i live to accomplish what i purpose that is produce a systematical history of what appear to me to be the genuine elements of human society let not the advocates of injustice and superstition flatter themselves that i should take aeschylus rather than plato as my model <\s>
<s> the having spoken of myself with unaffected freedom will need little apology with the candid and let the uncandid consider that they injure me less than their own hearts and minds by misrepresentation <\s>
<s> whatever talents a person may possess to amuse and instruct others be they ever so inconsiderable he is yet bound to exert them if his attempt be ineffectual let the punishment of an unaccomplished purpose have been sufficient let none trouble themselves to heap the dust of oblivion upon his efforts the pile they raise will betray his grave which might otherwise have been unknown <\s>

<s> but it is a mistake to suppose that i dedicate my poetical compositions solely to the direct enforcement of reform or that i consider them in any degree as containing a reasoned system on the theory of human life <\s>
<s> didactic poetry is my abhorrence nothing can be equally well expressed in prose that is not tedious and supererogatory in verse <\s>
<s> my purpose has hitherto been simply to familiarise the highly refined imagination of the more select classes of poetical readers with beautiful idealisms of moral excellence aware that until the mind can love and admire and trust and hope and endure reasoned principles of moral conduct are seeds cast upon the highway of life which the unconscious passenger tramples into dust although they would bear the harvest of his happiness <\s>
<s> should i live to accomplish what i purpose that is produce a systematical history of what appear to me to be the genuine elements of human society let not the advocates of injustice and superstition flatter themselves that i should take aeschylus rather than plato as my model <\s>
<s> the having spoken of myself with unaffected freedom will need little apology with the candid and let the uncandid consider that they injure me less than their own hearts and minds by misrepresentation <\s>
<s> whatever talents a person may possess to amuse and instruct others be they ever so inconsiderable he is yet bound to exert them if his attempt be ineffectual let the punishment of an unaccomplished purpose have been sufficient let none trouble themselves to heap the dust of oblivion upon his efforts the pile they raise will betray his grave which might otherwise have been unknown <\s>

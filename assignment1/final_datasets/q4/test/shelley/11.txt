<s> at last when at rome during a bright and beautiful spring he gave up his whole time to the composition <\s>
<s> the spot selected for his study was as he mentions in his preface the mountainous ruins of the baths of caracalla <\s>

<s> it is not my part in these notes to notice the arguments that have been urged against this opinion but to mention the fact that he entertained it and was indeed attached to it with fervent enthusiasm <\s>
<s> that man could be so perfectionized as to be able to expel evil from his own nature and from the greater part of the creation was the cardinal point of his system <\s>
<s> and the subject he loved best to dwell on was the image of one warring with the evil principle oppressed not only by it but by all even the good who were deluded into considering evil a necessary portion of humanity a victim full of fortitude and hope and the spirit of triumph emanating from a reliance in the ultimate omnipotence of good <\s>

<s> in almost every respect his journey to italy was advantageous <\s>

<s> he went direct to italy avoiding even paris and did not make any pause till he arrived at milan <\s>
<s> the first aspect of italy enchanted shelley it seemed a garden of delight placed beneath a clearer and brighter heaven than any he had lived under before <\s>
<s> he wrote long descriptive letters during the first year of his residence in italy which as compositions are the most beautiful in the world and show how truly he appreciated and studied the wonders of nature and art in that divine land <\s>
<s> the poetical spirit within him speedily revived with all the power and with more than all the beauty of his first attempts <\s>

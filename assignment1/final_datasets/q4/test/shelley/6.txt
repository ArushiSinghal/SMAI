<s> some said that he was mad others believed 90 that memories of an antenatal life made this where now he dwelt a penal hell and others said that such mysterious grief from god's displeasure like a darkness fell on souls like his which owned no higher law 95 than love love calm steadfast invincible by mortal fear or supernatural awe and others tis the shadow of a dream which the veiled eye of memory never saw but through the soul's abyss like some dark stream 100 through shattered mines and caverns underground rolls shaking its foundations and no beam of joy may rise but it is quenched and drowned in the dim whirlpools of this dream obscure soon its exhausted waters will have found 105 a lair of rest beneath thy spirit pure o athanase in one so good and great evil or tumult cannot long endure <\s>

<s> 160 and athanase her child who must have been then three years old sate opposite and gazed in patient silence <\s>
<s> such was zonoras and as daylight finds one amaranth glittering on the path of frost 165 when autumn nights have nipped all weaker kinds thus through his age dark cold and tempest tossed shone truth upon zonoras and he filled from fountains pure nigh overgrown and lost the spirit of prince athanase a child 170 with soul sustaining songs of ancient lore and philosophic wisdom clear and mild <\s>

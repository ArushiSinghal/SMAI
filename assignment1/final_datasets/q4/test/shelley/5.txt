<s> note on the revolt of islam by mrs <\s>
<s> shelley possessed two remarkable qualities of intellect a brilliant imagination and a logical exactness of reason <\s>
<s> his inclinations led him he fancied almost alike to poetry and metaphysical discussions <\s>
<s> i say he fancied because i believe the former to have been paramount and that it would have gained the mastery even had he struggled against it <\s>
<s> however he said that he deliberated at one time whether he should dedicate himself to poetry or metaphysics and resolving on the former he educated himself for it discarding in a great measure his philosophical pursuits and engaging himself in the study of the poets of greece italy and england <\s>
<s> to these may be added a constant perusal of portions of the old testament the psalms the book of job the prophet isaiah and others the sublime poetry of which filled him with delight <\s>
<s> as a poet his intellect and compositions were powerfully influenced by exterior circumstances and especially by his place of abode <\s>
<s> he was very fond of travelling and ill health increased this restlessness <\s>
<s> the sufferings occasioned by a cold english winter made him pine especially when our colder spring arrived for a more genial climate <\s>
<s> in 1816 he again visited switzerland and rented a house on the banks of the lake of geneva and many a day in cloud or sunshine was passed alone in his boat sailing as the wind listed or weltering on the calm waters <\s>
<s> the majestic aspect of nature ministered such thoughts as he afterwards enwove in verse <\s>
<s> his lines on the bridge of the arve and his hymn to intellectual beauty were written at this time <\s>
<s> perhaps during this summer his genius was checked by association with another poet whose nature was utterly dissimilar to his own yet who in the poem he wrote at that time gave tokens that he shared for a period the more abstract and etherealised inspiration of shelley <\s>
<s> the saddest events awaited his return to england but such was his fear to wound the feelings of others that he never expressed the anguish he felt and seldom gave vent to the indignation roused by the persecutions he underwent while the course of deep unexpressed passion and the sense of injury engendered the desire to embody themselves in forms defecated of all the weakness and evil which cling to real life <\s>
<s> he chose therefore for his hero a youth nourished in dreams of liberty some of whose actions are in direct opposition to the opinions of the world but who is animated throughout by an ardent love of virtue and a resolution to confer the boons of political and intellectual freedom on his fellow creatures <\s>
<s> he created for this youth a woman such as he delighted to imagine full of enthusiasm for the same objects and they both with will unvanquished and the deepest sense of the justice of their cause met adversity and death <\s>
<s> there exists in this poem a memorial of a friend of his youth <\s>
<s> the character of the old man who liberates laon from his tower prison and tends on him in sickness is founded on that of doctor lind who when shelley was at eton had often stood by to befriend and support him and whose name he never mentioned without love and veneration <\s>
<s> during the year 1817 we were established at marlow in buckinghamshire <\s>
<s> shelley's choice of abode was fixed chiefly by this town being at no great distance from london and its neighbourhood to the thames <\s>
<s> the poem was written in his boat as it floated under the beech groves of bisham or during wanderings in the neighbouring country which is distinguished for peculiar beauty <\s>
<s> the chalk hills break into cliffs that overhang the thames or form valleys clothed with beech the wilder portion of the country is rendered beautiful by exuberant vegetation and the cultivated part is peculiarly fertile <\s>
<s> with all this wealth of nature which either in the form of gentlemen's parks or soil dedicated to agriculture flourishes around marlow was inhabited i hope it is altered now by a very poor population <\s>
<s> the women are lacemakers and lose their health by sedentary labour for which they were very ill paid <\s>
<s> the poor laws ground to the dust not only the paupers but those who had risen just above that state and were obliged to pay poor rates <\s>
<s> the changes produced by peace following a long war and a bad harvest brought with them the most heart rending evils to the poor <\s>
<s> shelley afforded what alleviation he could <\s>
<s> in the winter while bringing out his poem he had a severe attack of ophthalmia caught while visiting the poor cottages <\s>
<s> i mention these things for this minute and active sympathy with his fellow creatures gives a thousandfold interest to his speculations and stamps with reality his pleadings for the human race <\s>
<s> the poem bold in its opinions and uncompromising in their expression met with many censurers not only among those who allow of no virtue but such as supports the cause they espouse but even among those whose opinions were similar to his own <\s>
<s> i extract a portion of a letter written in answer to one of these friends <\s>
<s> it best details the impulses of shelley's mind and his motives it was written with entire unreserve and is therefore a precious monument of his own opinion of his powers of the purity of his designs and the ardour with which he clung in adversity and through the valley of the shadow of death to views from which he believed the permanent happiness of mankind must eventually spring <\s>

<s> note on the revolt of islam by mrs <\s>
<s> shelley possessed two remarkable qualities of intellect a brilliant imagination and a logical exactness of reason <\s>
<s> his inclinations led him he fancied almost alike to poetry and metaphysical discussions <\s>
<s> i say he fancied because i believe the former to have been paramount and that it would have gained the mastery even had he struggled against it <\s>
<s> however he said that he deliberated at one time whether he should dedicate himself to poetry or metaphysics and resolving on the former he educated himself for it discarding in a great measure his philosophical pursuits and engaging himself in the study of the poets of greece italy and england <\s>
<s> to these may be added a constant perusal of portions of the old testament the psalms the book of job the prophet isaiah and others the sublime poetry of which filled him with delight <\s>
<s> as a poet his intellect and compositions were powerfully influenced by exterior circumstances and especially by his place of abode <\s>
<s> he was very fond of travelling and ill health increased this restlessness <\s>
<s> the sufferings occasioned by a cold english winter made him pine especially when our colder spring arrived for a more genial climate <\s>
<s> in 1816 he again visited switzerland and rented a house on the banks of the lake of geneva and many a day in cloud or sunshine was passed alone in his boat sailing as the wind listed or weltering on the calm waters <\s>
<s> the majestic aspect of nature ministered such thoughts as he afterwards enwove in verse <\s>
<s> his lines on the bridge of the arve and his hymn to intellectual beauty were written at this time <\s>
<s> perhaps during this summer his genius was checked by association with another poet whose nature was utterly dissimilar to his own yet who in the poem he wrote at that time gave tokens that he shared for a period the more abstract and etherealised inspiration of shelley <\s>
<s> the saddest events awaited his return to england but such was his fear to wound the feelings of others that he never expressed the anguish he felt and seldom gave vent to the indignation roused by the persecutions he underwent while the course of deep unexpressed passion and the sense of injury engendered the desire to embody themselves in forms defecated of all the weakness and evil which cling to real life <\s>
<s> he chose therefore for his hero a youth nourished in dreams of liberty some of whose actions are in direct opposition to the opinions of the world but who is animated throughout by an ardent love of virtue and a resolution to confer the boons of political and intellectual freedom on his fellow creatures <\s>
<s> he created for this youth a woman such as he delighted to imagine full of enthusiasm for the same objects and they both with will unvanquished and the deepest sense of the justice of their cause met adversity and death <\s>
<s> there exists in this poem a memorial of a friend of his youth <\s>
<s> the character of the old man who liberates laon from his tower prison and tends on him in sickness is founded on that of doctor lind who when shelley was at eton had often stood by to befriend and support him and whose name he never mentioned without love and veneration <\s>
<s> during the year 1817 we were established at marlow in buckinghamshire <\s>
<s> shelley's choice of abode was fixed chiefly by this town being at no great distance from london and its neighbourhood to the thames <\s>
<s> the poem was written in his boat as it floated under the beech groves of bisham or during wanderings in the neighbouring country which is distinguished for peculiar beauty <\s>
<s> the chalk hills break into cliffs that overhang the thames or form valleys clothed with beech the wilder portion of the country is rendered beautiful by exuberant vegetation and the cultivated part is peculiarly fertile <\s>
<s> with all this wealth of nature which either in the form of gentlemen's parks or soil dedicated to agriculture flourishes around marlow was inhabited i hope it is altered now by a very poor population <\s>
<s> the women are lacemakers and lose their health by sedentary labour for which they were very ill paid <\s>
<s> the poor laws ground to the dust not only the paupers but those who had risen just above that state and were obliged to pay poor rates <\s>
<s> the changes produced by peace following a long war and a bad harvest brought with them the most heart rending evils to the poor <\s>
<s> shelley afforded what alleviation he could <\s>
<s> in the winter while bringing out his poem he had a severe attack of ophthalmia caught while visiting the poor cottages <\s>
<s> i mention these things for this minute and active sympathy with his fellow creatures gives a thousandfold interest to his speculations and stamps with reality his pleadings for the human race <\s>
<s> the poem bold in its opinions and uncompromising in their expression met with many censurers not only among those who allow of no virtue but such as supports the cause they espouse but even among those whose opinions were similar to his own <\s>
<s> i extract a portion of a letter written in answer to one of these friends <\s>
<s> it best details the impulses of shelley's mind and his motives it was written with entire unreserve and is therefore a precious monument of his own opinion of his powers of the purity of his designs and the ardour with which he clung in adversity and through the valley of the shadow of death to views from which he believed the permanent happiness of mankind must eventually spring <\s>

<s> i have read and considered all that you say about my general powers and the particular instance of the poem in which i have attempted to develop them <\s>
<s> nothing can be more satisfactory to me than the interest which your admonitions express <\s>
<s> but i think you are mistaken in some points with regard to the peculiar nature of my powers whatever be their amount <\s>
<s> i listened with deference and self suspicion to your censures of the revolt of islam but the productions of mine which you commend hold a very low place in my own esteem and this reassures me in some degree at least <\s>
<s> the poem was produced by a series of thoughts which filled my mind with unbounded and sustained enthusiasm <\s>
<s> i felt the precariousness of my life and i engaged in this task resolved to leave some record of myself <\s>
<s> much of what the volume contains was written with the same feeling as real though not so prophetic as the communications of a dying man <\s>
<s> i never presumed indeed to consider it anything approaching to faultless but when i consider contemporary productions of the same apparent pretensions i own i was filled with confidence <\s>
<s> i felt that it was in many respects a genuine picture of my own mind <\s>
<s> i felt that the sentiments were true not assumed <\s>
<s> and in this have i long believed that my power consists in sympathy and that part of the imagination which relates to sentiment and contemplation <\s>
<s> i am formed if for anything not in common with the herd of mankind to apprehend minute and remote distinctions of feeling whether relative to external nature or the living beings which surround us and to communicate the conceptions which result from considering either the moral or the material universe as a whole <\s>
<s> of course i believe these faculties which perhaps comprehend all that is sublime in man to exist very imperfectly in my own mind <\s>
<s> but when you advert to my chancery paper a cold forced unimpassioned insignificant piece of cramped and cautious argument and to the little scrap about mandeville which expressed my feelings indeed but cost scarcely two minutes thought to express as specimens of my powers more favourable than that which grew as it were from the agony and bloody sweat of intellectual travail surely i must feel that in some manner either i am mistaken in believing that i have any talent at all or you in the selection of the specimens of it <\s>
<s> yet after all i cannot but be conscious in much of what i write of an absence of that tranquillity which is the attribute and accompaniment of power <\s>
<s> this feeling alone would make your most kind and wise admonitions on the subject of the economy of intellectual force valuable to me <\s>
<s> and if i live or if i see any trust in coming years doubt not but that i shall do something whatever it may be which a serious and earnest estimate of my powers will suggest to me and which will be in every respect accommodated to their utmost limits <\s>
<s> shelley to godwin prince athanase <\s>
<s> the idea shelley had formed of prince athanase was a good deal modelled on alastor <\s>
<s> in the first sketch of the poem he named it pandemos and urania <\s>
<s> athanase seeks through the world the one whom he may love <\s>
<s> he meets in the ship in which he is embarked a lady who appears to him to embody his ideal of love and beauty <\s>
<s> but she proves to be pandemos or the earthly and unworthy venus who after disappointing his cherished dreams and hopes deserts him <\s>
<s> athanase crushed by sorrow pines and dies <\s>
<s> on his deathbed the lady who can really reply to his soul comes and kisses his lips the deathbed of athanase <\s>
<s> the poet describes her in the words of the final fragment page 164 <\s>
<s> this slender note is all we have to aid our imagination in shaping out the form of the poem such as its author imagined <\s>

<s> note on the revolt of islam by mrs <\s>
<s> shelley possessed two remarkable qualities of intellect a brilliant imagination and a logical exactness of reason <\s>
<s> his inclinations led him he fancied almost alike to poetry and metaphysical discussions <\s>
<s> i say he fancied because i believe the former to have been paramount and that it would have gained the mastery even had he struggled against it <\s>
<s> however he said that he deliberated at one time whether he should dedicate himself to poetry or metaphysics and resolving on the former he educated himself for it discarding in a great measure his philosophical pursuits and engaging himself in the study of the poets of greece italy and england <\s>
<s> to these may be added a constant perusal of portions of the old testament the psalms the book of job the prophet isaiah and others the sublime poetry of which filled him with delight <\s>
<s> as a poet his intellect and compositions were powerfully influenced by exterior circumstances and especially by his place of abode <\s>
<s> he was very fond of travelling and ill health increased this restlessness <\s>
<s> the sufferings occasioned by a cold english winter made him pine especially when our colder spring arrived for a more genial climate <\s>
<s> in 1816 he again visited switzerland and rented a house on the banks of the lake of geneva and many a day in cloud or sunshine was passed alone in his boat sailing as the wind listed or weltering on the calm waters <\s>
<s> the majestic aspect of nature ministered such thoughts as he afterwards enwove in verse <\s>
<s> his lines on the bridge of the arve and his hymn to intellectual beauty were written at this time <\s>
<s> perhaps during this summer his genius was checked by association with another poet whose nature was utterly dissimilar to his own yet who in the poem he wrote at that time gave tokens that he shared for a period the more abstract and etherealised inspiration of shelley <\s>
<s> the saddest events awaited his return to england but such was his fear to wound the feelings of others that he never expressed the anguish he felt and seldom gave vent to the indignation roused by the persecutions he underwent while the course of deep unexpressed passion and the sense of injury engendered the desire to embody themselves in forms defecated of all the weakness and evil which cling to real life <\s>
<s> he chose therefore for his hero a youth nourished in dreams of liberty some of whose actions are in direct opposition to the opinions of the world but who is animated throughout by an ardent love of virtue and a resolution to confer the boons of political and intellectual freedom on his fellow creatures <\s>
<s> he created for this youth a woman such as he delighted to imagine full of enthusiasm for the same objects and they both with will unvanquished and the deepest sense of the justice of their cause met adversity and death <\s>
<s> there exists in this poem a memorial of a friend of his youth <\s>
<s> the character of the old man who liberates laon from his tower prison and tends on him in sickness is founded on that of doctor lind who when shelley was at eton had often stood by to befriend and support him and whose name he never mentioned without love and veneration <\s>
<s> during the year 1817 we were established at marlow in buckinghamshire <\s>
<s> shelley's choice of abode was fixed chiefly by this town being at no great distance from london and its neighbourhood to the thames <\s>
<s> the poem was written in his boat as it floated under the beech groves of bisham or during wanderings in the neighbouring country which is distinguished for peculiar beauty <\s>
<s> the chalk hills break into cliffs that overhang the thames or form valleys clothed with beech the wilder portion of the country is rendered beautiful by exuberant vegetation and the cultivated part is peculiarly fertile <\s>
<s> with all this wealth of nature which either in the form of gentlemen's parks or soil dedicated to agriculture flourishes around marlow was inhabited i hope it is altered now by a very poor population <\s>
<s> the women are lacemakers and lose their health by sedentary labour for which they were very ill paid <\s>
<s> the poor laws ground to the dust not only the paupers but those who had risen just above that state and were obliged to pay poor rates <\s>
<s> the changes produced by peace following a long war and a bad harvest brought with them the most heart rending evils to the poor <\s>
<s> shelley afforded what alleviation he could <\s>
<s> in the winter while bringing out his poem he had a severe attack of ophthalmia caught while visiting the poor cottages <\s>
<s> i mention these things for this minute and active sympathy with his fellow creatures gives a thousandfold interest to his speculations and stamps with reality his pleadings for the human race <\s>
<s> the poem bold in its opinions and uncompromising in their expression met with many censurers not only among those who allow of no virtue but such as supports the cause they espouse but even among those whose opinions were similar to his own <\s>
<s> i extract a portion of a letter written in answer to one of these friends <\s>
<s> it best details the impulses of shelley's mind and his motives it was written with entire unreserve and is therefore a precious monument of his own opinion of his powers of the purity of his designs and the ardour with which he clung in adversity and through the valley of the shadow of death to views from which he believed the permanent happiness of mankind must eventually spring <\s>
<s> marlowe december 11 1817 <\s>

<s> nothing can be more satisfactory to me than the interest which your admonitions express <\s>
<s> but i think you are mistaken in some points with regard to the peculiar nature of my powers whatever be their amount <\s>
<s> i listened with deference and self suspicion to your censures of the revolt of islam but the productions of mine which you commend hold a very low place in my own esteem and this reassures me in some degree at least <\s>
<s> the poem was produced by a series of thoughts which filled my mind with unbounded and sustained enthusiasm <\s>
<s> i felt the precariousness of my life and i engaged in this task resolved to leave some record of myself <\s>
<s> much of what the volume contains was written with the same feeling as real though not so prophetic as the communications of a dying man <\s>
<s> i never presumed indeed to consider it anything approaching to faultless but when i consider contemporary productions of the same apparent pretensions i own i was filled with confidence <\s>
<s> i felt that it was in many respects a genuine picture of my own mind <\s>
<s> i felt that the sentiments were true not assumed <\s>
<s> and in this have i long believed that my power consists in sympathy and that part of the imagination which relates to sentiment and contemplation <\s>
<s> i am formed if for anything not in common with the herd of mankind to apprehend minute and remote distinctions of feeling whether relative to external nature or the living beings which surround us and to communicate the conceptions which result from considering either the moral or the material universe as a whole <\s>
<s> of course i believe these faculties which perhaps comprehend all that is sublime in man to exist very imperfectly in my own mind <\s>
<s> but when you advert to my chancery paper a cold forced unimpassioned insignificant piece of cramped and cautious argument and to the little scrap about mandeville which expressed my feelings indeed but cost scarcely two minutes thought to express as specimens of my powers more favourable than that which grew as it were from the agony and bloody sweat of intellectual travail surely i must feel that in some manner either i am mistaken in believing that i have any talent at all or you in the selection of the specimens of it <\s>
<s> yet after all i cannot but be conscious in much of what i write of an absence of that tranquillity which is the attribute and accompaniment of power <\s>
<s> this feeling alone would make your most kind and wise admonitions on the subject of the economy of intellectual force valuable to me <\s>
<s> and if i live or if i see any trust in coming years doubt not but that i shall do something whatever it may be which a serious and earnest estimate of my powers will suggest to me and which will be in every respect accommodated to their utmost limits <\s>

<s> note on the revolt of islam by mrs <\s>
<s> shelley possessed two remarkable qualities of intellect a brilliant imagination and a logical exactness of reason <\s>
<s> his inclinations led him he fancied almost alike to poetry and metaphysical discussions <\s>
<s> i say he fancied because i believe the former to have been paramount and that it would have gained the mastery even had he struggled against it <\s>
<s> however he said that he deliberated at one time whether he should dedicate himself to poetry or metaphysics and resolving on the former he educated himself for it discarding in a great measure his philosophical pursuits and engaging himself in the study of the poets of greece italy and england <\s>
<s> to these may be added a constant perusal of portions of the old testament the psalms the book of job the prophet isaiah and others the sublime poetry of which filled him with delight <\s>
<s> as a poet his intellect and compositions were powerfully influenced by exterior circumstances and especially by his place of abode <\s>
<s> he was very fond of travelling and ill health increased this restlessness <\s>
<s> the sufferings occasioned by a cold english winter made him pine especially when our colder spring arrived for a more genial climate <\s>
<s> in 1816 he again visited switzerland and rented a house on the banks of the lake of geneva and many a day in cloud or sunshine was passed alone in his boat sailing as the wind listed or weltering on the calm waters <\s>
<s> the majestic aspect of nature ministered such thoughts as he afterwards enwove in verse <\s>
<s> his lines on the bridge of the arve and his hymn to intellectual beauty were written at this time <\s>
<s> perhaps during this summer his genius was checked by association with another poet whose nature was utterly dissimilar to his own yet who in the poem he wrote at that time gave tokens that he shared for a period the more abstract and etherealised inspiration of shelley <\s>
<s> the saddest events awaited his return to england but such was his fear to wound the feelings of others that he never expressed the anguish he felt and seldom gave vent to the indignation roused by the persecutions he underwent while the course of deep unexpressed passion and the sense of injury engendered the desire to embody themselves in forms defecated of all the weakness and evil which cling to real life <\s>
<s> he chose therefore for his hero a youth nourished in dreams of liberty some of whose actions are in direct opposition to the opinions of the world but who is animated throughout by an ardent love of virtue and a resolution to confer the boons of political and intellectual freedom on his fellow creatures <\s>
<s> he created for this youth a woman such as he delighted to imagine full of enthusiasm for the same objects and they both with will unvanquished and the deepest sense of the justice of their cause met adversity and death <\s>
<s> there exists in this poem a memorial of a friend of his youth <\s>
<s> the character of the old man who liberates laon from his tower prison and tends on him in sickness is founded on that of doctor lind who when shelley was at eton had often stood by to befriend and support him and whose name he never mentioned without love and veneration <\s>
<s> during the year 1817 we were established at marlow in buckinghamshire <\s>
<s> shelley's choice of abode was fixed chiefly by this town being at no great distance from london and its neighbourhood to the thames <\s>
<s> the poem was written in his boat as it floated under the beech groves of bisham or during wanderings in the neighbouring country which is distinguished for peculiar beauty <\s>
<s> the chalk hills break into cliffs that overhang the thames or form valleys clothed with beech the wilder portion of the country is rendered beautiful by exuberant vegetation and the cultivated part is peculiarly fertile <\s>
<s> with all this wealth of nature which either in the form of gentlemen's parks or soil dedicated to agriculture flourishes around marlow was inhabited i hope it is altered now by a very poor population <\s>
<s> the women are lacemakers and lose their health by sedentary labour for which they were very ill paid <\s>
<s> the poor laws ground to the dust not only the paupers but those who had risen just above that state and were obliged to pay poor rates <\s>
<s> the changes produced by peace following a long war and a bad harvest brought with them the most heart rending evils to the poor <\s>
<s> shelley afforded what alleviation he could <\s>
<s> in the winter while bringing out his poem he had a severe attack of ophthalmia caught while visiting the poor cottages <\s>
<s> i mention these things for this minute and active sympathy with his fellow creatures gives a thousandfold interest to his speculations and stamps with reality his pleadings for the human race <\s>
<s> the poem bold in its opinions and uncompromising in their expression met with many censurers not only among those who allow of no virtue but such as supports the cause they espouse but even among those whose opinions were similar to his own <\s>
<s> i extract a portion of a letter written in answer to one of these friends <\s>
<s> it best details the impulses of shelley's mind and his motives it was written with entire unreserve and is therefore a precious monument of his own opinion of his powers of the purity of his designs and the ardour with which he clung in adversity and through the valley of the shadow of death to views from which he believed the permanent happiness of mankind must eventually spring <\s>

<s> note on the revolt of islam by mrs <\s>
<s> shelley possessed two remarkable qualities of intellect a brilliant imagination and a logical exactness of reason <\s>
<s> his inclinations led him he fancied almost alike to poetry and metaphysical discussions <\s>
<s> i say he fancied because i believe the former to have been paramount and that it would have gained the mastery even had he struggled against it <\s>
<s> however he said that he deliberated at one time whether he should dedicate himself to poetry or metaphysics and resolving on the former he educated himself for it discarding in a great measure his philosophical pursuits and engaging himself in the study of the poets of greece italy and england <\s>
<s> to these may be added a constant perusal of portions of the old testament the psalms the book of job the prophet isaiah and others the sublime poetry of which filled him with delight <\s>
<s> as a poet his intellect and compositions were powerfully influenced by exterior circumstances and especially by his place of abode <\s>
<s> he was very fond of travelling and ill health increased this restlessness <\s>
<s> the sufferings occasioned by a cold english winter made him pine especially when our colder spring arrived for a more genial climate <\s>
<s> in 1816 he again visited switzerland and rented a house on the banks of the lake of geneva and many a day in cloud or sunshine was passed alone in his boat sailing as the wind listed or weltering on the calm waters <\s>
<s> the majestic aspect of nature ministered such thoughts as he afterwards enwove in verse <\s>
<s> his lines on the bridge of the arve and his hymn to intellectual beauty were written at this time <\s>
<s> perhaps during this summer his genius was checked by association with another poet whose nature was utterly dissimilar to his own yet who in the poem he wrote at that time gave tokens that he shared for a period the more abstract and etherealised inspiration of shelley <\s>
<s> the saddest events awaited his return to england but such was his fear to wound the feelings of others that he never expressed the anguish he felt and seldom gave vent to the indignation roused by the persecutions he underwent while the course of deep unexpressed passion and the sense of injury engendered the desire to embody themselves in forms defecated of all the weakness and evil which cling to real life <\s>
<s> he chose therefore for his hero a youth nourished in dreams of liberty some of whose actions are in direct opposition to the opinions of the world but who is animated throughout by an ardent love of virtue and a resolution to confer the boons of political and intellectual freedom on his fellow creatures <\s>
<s> he created for this youth a woman such as he delighted to imagine full of enthusiasm for the same objects and they both with will unvanquished and the deepest sense of the justice of their cause met adversity and death <\s>
<s> there exists in this poem a memorial of a friend of his youth <\s>
<s> the character of the old man who liberates laon from his tower prison and tends on him in sickness is founded on that of doctor lind who when shelley was at eton had often stood by to befriend and support him and whose name he never mentioned without love and veneration <\s>
<s> during the year 1817 we were established at marlow in buckinghamshire <\s>
<s> shelley's choice of abode was fixed chiefly by this town being at no great distance from london and its neighbourhood to the thames <\s>
<s> the poem was written in his boat as it floated under the beech groves of bisham or during wanderings in the neighbouring country which is distinguished for peculiar beauty <\s>
<s> the chalk hills break into cliffs that overhang the thames or form valleys clothed with beech the wilder portion of the country is rendered beautiful by exuberant vegetation and the cultivated part is peculiarly fertile <\s>
<s> with all this wealth of nature which either in the form of gentlemen's parks or soil dedicated to agriculture flourishes around marlow was inhabited i hope it is altered now by a very poor population <\s>
<s> the women are lacemakers and lose their health by sedentary labour for which they were very ill paid <\s>
<s> the poor laws ground to the dust not only the paupers but those who had risen just above that state and were obliged to pay poor rates <\s>
<s> the changes produced by peace following a long war and a bad harvest brought with them the most heart rending evils to the poor <\s>
<s> shelley afforded what alleviation he could <\s>
<s> in the winter while bringing out his poem he had a severe attack of ophthalmia caught while visiting the poor cottages <\s>
<s> i mention these things for this minute and active sympathy with his fellow creatures gives a thousandfold interest to his speculations and stamps with reality his pleadings for the human race <\s>
<s> the poem bold in its opinions and uncompromising in their expression met with many censurers not only among those who allow of no virtue but such as supports the cause they espouse but even among those whose opinions were similar to his own <\s>
<s> i extract a portion of a letter written in answer to one of these friends <\s>
<s> it best details the impulses of shelley's mind and his motives it was written with entire unreserve and is therefore a precious monument of his own opinion of his powers of the purity of his designs and the ardour with which he clung in adversity and through the valley of the shadow of death to views from which he believed the permanent happiness of mankind must eventually spring <\s>

<s> note on the revolt of islam by mrs <\s>
<s> shelley possessed two remarkable qualities of intellect a brilliant imagination and a logical exactness of reason <\s>
<s> his inclinations led him he fancied almost alike to poetry and metaphysical discussions <\s>
<s> i say he fancied because i believe the former to have been paramount and that it would have gained the mastery even had he struggled against it <\s>
<s> however he said that he deliberated at one time whether he should dedicate himself to poetry or metaphysics and resolving on the former he educated himself for it discarding in a great measure his philosophical pursuits and engaging himself in the study of the poets of greece italy and england <\s>
<s> to these may be added a constant perusal of portions of the old testament the psalms the book of job the prophet isaiah and others the sublime poetry of which filled him with delight <\s>
<s> as a poet his intellect and compositions were powerfully influenced by exterior circumstances and especially by his place of abode <\s>
<s> he was very fond of travelling and ill health increased this restlessness <\s>
<s> the sufferings occasioned by a cold english winter made him pine especially when our colder spring arrived for a more genial climate <\s>
<s> in 1816 he again visited switzerland and rented a house on the banks of the lake of geneva and many a day in cloud or sunshine was passed alone in his boat sailing as the wind listed or weltering on the calm waters <\s>
<s> the majestic aspect of nature ministered such thoughts as he afterwards enwove in verse <\s>
<s> his lines on the bridge of the arve and his hymn to intellectual beauty were written at this time <\s>
<s> perhaps during this summer his genius was checked by association with another poet whose nature was utterly dissimilar to his own yet who in the poem he wrote at that time gave tokens that he shared for a period the more abstract and etherealised inspiration of shelley <\s>
<s> the saddest events awaited his return to england but such was his fear to wound the feelings of others that he never expressed the anguish he felt and seldom gave vent to the indignation roused by the persecutions he underwent while the course of deep unexpressed passion and the sense of injury engendered the desire to embody themselves in forms defecated of all the weakness and evil which cling to real life <\s>
<s> he chose therefore for his hero a youth nourished in dreams of liberty some of whose actions are in direct opposition to the opinions of the world but who is animated throughout by an ardent love of virtue and a resolution to confer the boons of political and intellectual freedom on his fellow creatures <\s>
<s> he created for this youth a woman such as he delighted to imagine full of enthusiasm for the same objects and they both with will unvanquished and the deepest sense of the justice of their cause met adversity and death <\s>
<s> there exists in this poem a memorial of a friend of his youth <\s>
<s> the character of the old man who liberates laon from his tower prison and tends on him in sickness is founded on that of doctor lind who when shelley was at eton had often stood by to befriend and support him and whose name he never mentioned without love and veneration <\s>

<s> note on the revolt of islam by mrs <\s>
<s> shelley possessed two remarkable qualities of intellect a brilliant imagination and a logical exactness of reason <\s>
<s> his inclinations led him he fancied almost alike to poetry and metaphysical discussions <\s>
<s> i say he fancied because i believe the former to have been paramount and that it would have gained the mastery even had he struggled against it <\s>
<s> however he said that he deliberated at one time whether he should dedicate himself to poetry or metaphysics and resolving on the former he educated himself for it discarding in a great measure his philosophical pursuits and engaging himself in the study of the poets of greece italy and england <\s>
<s> to these may be added a constant perusal of portions of the old testament the psalms the book of job the prophet isaiah and others the sublime poetry of which filled him with delight <\s>
<s> as a poet his intellect and compositions were powerfully influenced by exterior circumstances and especially by his place of abode <\s>
<s> he was very fond of travelling and ill health increased this restlessness <\s>
<s> the sufferings occasioned by a cold english winter made him pine especially when our colder spring arrived for a more genial climate <\s>
<s> in 1816 he again visited switzerland and rented a house on the banks of the lake of geneva and many a day in cloud or sunshine was passed alone in his boat sailing as the wind listed or weltering on the calm waters <\s>
<s> the majestic aspect of nature ministered such thoughts as he afterwards enwove in verse <\s>
<s> his lines on the bridge of the arve and his hymn to intellectual beauty were written at this time <\s>
<s> perhaps during this summer his genius was checked by association with another poet whose nature was utterly dissimilar to his own yet who in the poem he wrote at that time gave tokens that he shared for a period the more abstract and etherealised inspiration of shelley <\s>
<s> the saddest events awaited his return to england but such was his fear to wound the feelings of others that he never expressed the anguish he felt and seldom gave vent to the indignation roused by the persecutions he underwent while the course of deep unexpressed passion and the sense of injury engendered the desire to embody themselves in forms defecated of all the weakness and evil which cling to real life <\s>
<s> he chose therefore for his hero a youth nourished in dreams of liberty some of whose actions are in direct opposition to the opinions of the world but who is animated throughout by an ardent love of virtue and a resolution to confer the boons of political and intellectual freedom on his fellow creatures <\s>
<s> he created for this youth a woman such as he delighted to imagine full of enthusiasm for the same objects and they both with will unvanquished and the deepest sense of the justice of their cause met adversity and death <\s>
<s> there exists in this poem a memorial of a friend of his youth <\s>
<s> the character of the old man who liberates laon from his tower prison and tends on him in sickness is founded on that of doctor lind who when shelley was at eton had often stood by to befriend and support him and whose name he never mentioned without love and veneration <\s>
<s> during the year 1817 we were established at marlow in buckinghamshire <\s>
<s> shelley's choice of abode was fixed chiefly by this town being at no great distance from london and its neighbourhood to the thames <\s>
<s> the poem was written in his boat as it floated under the beech groves of bisham or during wanderings in the neighbouring country which is distinguished for peculiar beauty <\s>
<s> the chalk hills break into cliffs that overhang the thames or form valleys clothed with beech the wilder portion of the country is rendered beautiful by exuberant vegetation and the cultivated part is peculiarly fertile <\s>
<s> with all this wealth of nature which either in the form of gentlemen's parks or soil dedicated to agriculture flourishes around marlow was inhabited i hope it is altered now by a very poor population <\s>
<s> the women are lacemakers and lose their health by sedentary labour for which they were very ill paid <\s>
<s> the poor laws ground to the dust not only the paupers but those who had risen just above that state and were obliged to pay poor rates <\s>
<s> the changes produced by peace following a long war and a bad harvest brought with them the most heart rending evils to the poor <\s>
<s> shelley afforded what alleviation he could <\s>
<s> in the winter while bringing out his poem he had a severe attack of ophthalmia caught while visiting the poor cottages <\s>
<s> i mention these things for this minute and active sympathy with his fellow creatures gives a thousandfold interest to his speculations and stamps with reality his pleadings for the human race <\s>
<s> the poem bold in its opinions and uncompromising in their expression met with many censurers not only among those who allow of no virtue but such as supports the cause they espouse but even among those whose opinions were similar to his own <\s>
<s> i extract a portion of a letter written in answer to one of these friends <\s>
<s> it best details the impulses of shelley's mind and his motives it was written with entire unreserve and is therefore a precious monument of his own opinion of his powers of the purity of his designs and the ardour with which he clung in adversity and through the valley of the shadow of death to views from which he believed the permanent happiness of mankind must eventually spring <\s>

<s> note on the revolt of islam by mrs <\s>
<s> shelley possessed two remarkable qualities of intellect a brilliant imagination and a logical exactness of reason <\s>
<s> his inclinations led him he fancied almost alike to poetry and metaphysical discussions <\s>
<s> i say he fancied because i believe the former to have been paramount and that it would have gained the mastery even had he struggled against it <\s>
<s> however he said that he deliberated at one time whether he should dedicate himself to poetry or metaphysics and resolving on the former he educated himself for it discarding in a great measure his philosophical pursuits and engaging himself in the study of the poets of greece italy and england <\s>
<s> to these may be added a constant perusal of portions of the old testament the psalms the book of job the prophet isaiah and others the sublime poetry of which filled him with delight <\s>
<s> as a poet his intellect and compositions were powerfully influenced by exterior circumstances and especially by his place of abode <\s>
<s> he was very fond of travelling and ill health increased this restlessness <\s>
<s> the sufferings occasioned by a cold english winter made him pine especially when our colder spring arrived for a more genial climate <\s>
<s> in 1816 he again visited switzerland and rented a house on the banks of the lake of geneva and many a day in cloud or sunshine was passed alone in his boat sailing as the wind listed or weltering on the calm waters <\s>
<s> the majestic aspect of nature ministered such thoughts as he afterwards enwove in verse <\s>
<s> his lines on the bridge of the arve and his hymn to intellectual beauty were written at this time <\s>
<s> perhaps during this summer his genius was checked by association with another poet whose nature was utterly dissimilar to his own yet who in the poem he wrote at that time gave tokens that he shared for a period the more abstract and etherealised inspiration of shelley <\s>
<s> the saddest events awaited his return to england but such was his fear to wound the feelings of others that he never expressed the anguish he felt and seldom gave vent to the indignation roused by the persecutions he underwent while the course of deep unexpressed passion and the sense of injury engendered the desire to embody themselves in forms defecated of all the weakness and evil which cling to real life <\s>
<s> he chose therefore for his hero a youth nourished in dreams of liberty some of whose actions are in direct opposition to the opinions of the world but who is animated throughout by an ardent love of virtue and a resolution to confer the boons of political and intellectual freedom on his fellow creatures <\s>
<s> he created for this youth a woman such as he delighted to imagine full of enthusiasm for the same objects and they both with will unvanquished and the deepest sense of the justice of their cause met adversity and death <\s>
<s> there exists in this poem a memorial of a friend of his youth <\s>
<s> the character of the old man who liberates laon from his tower prison and tends on him in sickness is founded on that of doctor lind who when shelley was at eton had often stood by to befriend and support him and whose name he never mentioned without love and veneration <\s>
<s> during the year 1817 we were established at marlow in buckinghamshire <\s>
<s> shelley's choice of abode was fixed chiefly by this town being at no great distance from london and its neighbourhood to the thames <\s>
<s> the poem was written in his boat as it floated under the beech groves of bisham or during wanderings in the neighbouring country which is distinguished for peculiar beauty <\s>
<s> the chalk hills break into cliffs that overhang the thames or form valleys clothed with beech the wilder portion of the country is rendered beautiful by exuberant vegetation and the cultivated part is peculiarly fertile <\s>
<s> with all this wealth of nature which either in the form of gentlemen's parks or soil dedicated to agriculture flourishes around marlow was inhabited i hope it is altered now by a very poor population <\s>
<s> the women are lacemakers and lose their health by sedentary labour for which they were very ill paid <\s>
<s> the poor laws ground to the dust not only the paupers but those who had risen just above that state and were obliged to pay poor rates <\s>
<s> the changes produced by peace following a long war and a bad harvest brought with them the most heart rending evils to the poor <\s>
<s> shelley afforded what alleviation he could <\s>
<s> in the winter while bringing out his poem he had a severe attack of ophthalmia caught while visiting the poor cottages <\s>
<s> i mention these things for this minute and active sympathy with his fellow creatures gives a thousandfold interest to his speculations and stamps with reality his pleadings for the human race <\s>
<s> the poem bold in its opinions and uncompromising in their expression met with many censurers not only among those who allow of no virtue but such as supports the cause they espouse but even among those whose opinions were similar to his own <\s>
<s> i extract a portion of a letter written in answer to one of these friends <\s>
<s> it best details the impulses of shelley's mind and his motives it was written with entire unreserve and is therefore a precious monument of his own opinion of his powers of the purity of his designs and the ardour with which he clung in adversity and through the valley of the shadow of death to views from which he believed the permanent happiness of mankind must eventually spring <\s>
<s> marlowe december 11 1817 <\s>
<s> i have read and considered all that you say about my general powers and the particular instance of the poem in which i have attempted to develop them <\s>
<s> nothing can be more satisfactory to me than the interest which your admonitions express <\s>
<s> but i think you are mistaken in some points with regard to the peculiar nature of my powers whatever be their amount <\s>
<s> i listened with deference and self suspicion to your censures of the revolt of islam but the productions of mine which you commend hold a very low place in my own esteem and this reassures me in some degree at least <\s>
<s> the poem was produced by a series of thoughts which filled my mind with unbounded and sustained enthusiasm <\s>
<s> i felt the precariousness of my life and i engaged in this task resolved to leave some record of myself <\s>
<s> much of what the volume contains was written with the same feeling as real though not so prophetic as the communications of a dying man <\s>
<s> i never presumed indeed to consider it anything approaching to faultless but when i consider contemporary productions of the same apparent pretensions i own i was filled with confidence <\s>
<s> i felt that it was in many respects a genuine picture of my own mind <\s>
<s> i felt that the sentiments were true not assumed <\s>
<s> and in this have i long believed that my power consists in sympathy and that part of the imagination which relates to sentiment and contemplation <\s>
<s> i am formed if for anything not in common with the herd of mankind to apprehend minute and remote distinctions of feeling whether relative to external nature or the living beings which surround us and to communicate the conceptions which result from considering either the moral or the material universe as a whole <\s>
<s> of course i believe these faculties which perhaps comprehend all that is sublime in man to exist very imperfectly in my own mind <\s>
<s> but when you advert to my chancery paper a cold forced unimpassioned insignificant piece of cramped and cautious argument and to the little scrap about mandeville which expressed my feelings indeed but cost scarcely two minutes thought to express as specimens of my powers more favourable than that which grew as it were from the agony and bloody sweat of intellectual travail surely i must feel that in some manner either i am mistaken in believing that i have any talent at all or you in the selection of the specimens of it <\s>
<s> yet after all i cannot but be conscious in much of what i write of an absence of that tranquillity which is the attribute and accompaniment of power <\s>
<s> this feeling alone would make your most kind and wise admonitions on the subject of the economy of intellectual force valuable to me <\s>
<s> and if i live or if i see any trust in coming years doubt not but that i shall do something whatever it may be which a serious and earnest estimate of my powers will suggest to me and which will be in every respect accommodated to their utmost limits <\s>
<s> shelley to godwin prince athanase <\s>
<s> the idea shelley had formed of prince athanase was a good deal modelled on alastor <\s>
<s> in the first sketch of the poem he named it pandemos and urania <\s>
<s> athanase seeks through the world the one whom he may love <\s>
<s> he meets in the ship in which he is embarked a lady who appears to him to embody his ideal of love and beauty <\s>
<s> but she proves to be pandemos or the earthly and unworthy venus who after disappointing his cherished dreams and hopes deserts him <\s>
<s> athanase crushed by sorrow pines and dies <\s>
<s> on his deathbed the lady who can really reply to his soul comes and kisses his lips the deathbed of athanase <\s>
<s> the poet describes her in the words of the final fragment page 164 <\s>
<s> this slender note is all we have to aid our imagination in shaping out the form of the poem such as its author imagined <\s>

<s> there was a youth who as with toil and travel had grown quite weak and gray before his time nor any could the restless griefs unravel which burned within him withering up his prime and goading him like fiends from land to land <\s>
<s> 5 not his the load of any secret crime for nought of ill his heart could understand but pity and wild sorrow for the same not his the thirst for glory or command baffled with blast of hope consuming shame 10 nor evil joys which fire the vulgar breast and quench in speedy smoke its feeble flame had left within his soul their dark unrest nor what religion fables of the grave feared he philosophy's accepted guest <\s>
<s> 15 for none than he a purer heart could have or that loved good more for itself alone of nought in heaven or earth was he the slave <\s>
<s> what sorrow strange and shadowy and unknown sent him a hopeless wanderer through mankind 20 if with a human sadness he did groan he had a gentle yet aspiring mind just innocent with varied learning fed and such a glorious consolation find in others joy when all their own is dead 25 he loved and laboured for his kind in grief and yet unlike all others it is said that from such toil he never found relief <\s>
<s> although a child of fortune and of power of an ancestral name the orphan chief 30 his soul had wedded wisdom and her dower is love and justice clothed in which he sate apart from men as in a lonely tower pitying the tumult of their dark estate yet even in youth did he not e'er abuse 35 the strength of wealth or thought to consecrate those false opinions which the harsh rich use to blind the world they famish for their pride nor did he hold from any man his dues but like a steward in honest dealings tried 40 with those who toiled and wept the poor and wise his riches and his cares he did divide <\s>

<s> the subject in its present state is insusceptible of being treated otherwise than lyrically and if i have called this poem a drama from the circumstance of its being composed in dialogue the licence is not greater than that which has been assumed by other poets who have called their productions epics only because they have been divided into twelve or twenty four books <\s>
<s> the persae of aeschylus afforded me the first model of my conception although the decision of the glorious contest now waging in greece being yet suspended forbids a catastrophe parallel to the return of xerxes and the desolation of the persians <\s>

<s> the subject in its present state is insusceptible of being treated otherwise than lyrically and if i have called this poem a drama from the circumstance of its being composed in dialogue the licence is not greater than that which has been assumed by other poets who have called their productions epics only because they have been divided into twelve or twenty four books <\s>
<s> the persae of aeschylus afforded me the first model of my conception although the decision of the glorious contest now waging in greece being yet suspended forbids a catastrophe parallel to the return of xerxes and the desolation of the persians <\s>

<s> the subject in its present state is insusceptible of being treated otherwise than lyrically and if i have called this poem a drama from the circumstance of its being composed in dialogue the licence is not greater than that which has been assumed by other poets who have called their productions epics only because they have been divided into twelve or twenty four books <\s>
<s> the persae of aeschylus afforded me the first model of my conception although the decision of the glorious contest now waging in greece being yet suspended forbids a catastrophe parallel to the return of xerxes and the desolation of the persians <\s>

<s> the subject in its present state is insusceptible of being treated otherwise than lyrically and if i have called this poem a drama from the circumstance of its being composed in dialogue the licence is not greater than that which has been assumed by other poets who have called their productions epics only because they have been divided into twelve or twenty four books <\s>
<s> the persae of aeschylus afforded me the first model of my conception although the decision of the glorious contest now waging in greece being yet suspended forbids a catastrophe parallel to the return of xerxes and the desolation of the persians <\s>

<s> the subject in its present state is insusceptible of being treated otherwise than lyrically and if i have called this poem a drama from the circumstance of its being composed in dialogue the licence is not greater than that which has been assumed by other poets who have called their productions epics only because they have been divided into twelve or twenty four books <\s>
<s> the persae of aeschylus afforded me the first model of my conception although the decision of the glorious contest now waging in greece being yet suspended forbids a catastrophe parallel to the return of xerxes and the desolation of the persians <\s>

<s> the subject in its present state is insusceptible of being treated otherwise than lyrically and if i have called this poem a drama from the circumstance of its being composed in dialogue the licence is not greater than that which has been assumed by other poets who have called their productions epics only because they have been divided into twelve or twenty four books <\s>
<s> the persae of aeschylus afforded me the first model of my conception although the decision of the glorious contest now waging in greece being yet suspended forbids a catastrophe parallel to the return of xerxes and the desolation of the persians <\s>

<s> the subject in its present state is insusceptible of being treated otherwise than lyrically and if i have called this poem a drama from the circumstance of its being composed in dialogue the licence is not greater than that which has been assumed by other poets who have called their productions epics only because they have been divided into twelve or twenty four books <\s>
<s> the persae of aeschylus afforded me the first model of my conception although the decision of the glorious contest now waging in greece being yet suspended forbids a catastrophe parallel to the return of xerxes and the desolation of the persians <\s>

<s> the apathy of the rulers of the civilised world to the astonishing circumstance of the descendants of that nation to which they owe their civilisation rising as it were from the ashes of their ruin is something perfectly inexplicable to a mere spectator of the shows of this mortal scene <\s>
<s> we are all greeks <\s>
<s> our laws our literature our religion our arts have their root in greece <\s>
<s> but for greece rome the instructor the conqueror or the metropolis of our ancestors would have spread no illumination with her arms and we might still have been savages and idolaters or what is worse might have arrived at such a stagnant and miserable state of social institution as china and japan possess <\s>
<s> the human form and the human mind attained to a perfection in greece which has impressed its image on those faultless productions whose very fragments are the despair of modern art and has propagated impulses which cannot cease through a thousand channels of manifest or imperceptible operation to ennoble and delight mankind until the extinction of the race <\s>
<s> the modern greek is the descendant of those glorious beings whom the imagination almost refuses to figure to itself as belonging to our kind and he inherits much of their sensibility their rapidity of conception their enthusiasm and their courage <\s>
<s> if in many instances he is degraded by moral and political slavery to the practice of the basest vices it engenders and that below the level of ordinary degradation let us reflect that the corruption of the best produces the worst and that habits which subsist only in relation to a peculiar state of social institution may be expected to cease as soon as that relation is dissolved <\s>
<s> in fact the greeks since the admirable novel of anastasius could have been a faithful picture of their manners have undergone most important changes the flower of their youth returning to their country from the universities of italy germany and france have communicated to their fellow citizens the latest results of that social perfection of which their ancestors were the original source <\s>
<s> the university of chios contained before the breaking out of the revolution eight hundred students and among them several germans and americans <\s>
<s> the munificence and energy of many of the greek princes and merchants directed to the renovation of their country with a spirit and a wisdom which has few examples is above all praise <\s>
<s> the english permit their own oppressors to act according to their natural sympathy with the turkish tyrant and to brand upon their name the indelible blot of an alliance with the enemies of domestic happiness of christianity and civilisation <\s>
<s> russia desires to possess not to liberate greece and is contented to see the turks its natural enemies and the greeks its intended slaves enfeeble each other until one or both fall into its net <\s>
<s> the wise and generous policy of england would have consisted in establishing the independence of greece and in maintaining it both against russia and the turk but when was the oppressor generous or just <\s>
<s> should the english people ever become free they will reflect upon the part which those who presume to represent their will have played in the great drama of the revival of liberty with feelings which it would become them to anticipate <\s>
<s> this is the age of the war of the oppressed against the oppressors and every one of those ringleaders of the privileged gangs of murderers and swindlers called sovereigns look to each other for aid against the common enemy and suspend their mutual jealousies in the presence of a mightier fear <\s>
<s> of this holy alliance all the despots of the earth are virtual members <\s>

<s> the retrospect cwm elan 1812 <\s>
<s> published from the esdaile manuscript book by dowden life of shelley 1887 a scene which wildered fancy viewed in the soul's coldest solitude with that same scene when peaceful love flings rapture's colour o'er the grove when mountain meadow wood and stream 5 with unalloying glory gleam and to the spirit's ear and eye are unison and harmony <\s>
<s> the moonlight was my dearer day then would i wander far away 10 and lingering on the wild brook's shore to hear its unremitting roar would lose in the ideal flow all sense of overwhelming woe or at the noiseless noon of night 15 would climb some heathy mountain's height and listen to the mystic sound that stole in fitful gasps around <\s>
<s> i joyed to see the streaks of day above the purple peaks decay 20 and watch the latest line of light just mingling with the shades of night for day with me was time of woe when even tears refused to flow then would i stretch my languid frame 25 beneath the wild woods gloomiest shade and try to quench the ceaseless flame that on my withered vitals preyed would close mine eyes and dream i were on some remote and friendless plain 30 and long to leave existence there if with it i might leave the pain that with a finger cold and lean wrote madness on my withering mien <\s>
<s> it was not unrequited love 35 that bade my wildered spirit rove twas not the pride disdaining life that with this mortal world at strife would yield to the soul's inward sense then groan in human impotence 40 and weep because it is not given to taste on earth the peace of heaven <\s>
<s> twas not that in the narrow sphere where nature fixed my wayward fate there was no friend or kindred dear 45 formed to become that spirit's mate which searching on tired pinion found barren and cold repulse around oh no <\s>
<s> yet each one sorrow gave new graces to the narrow grave <\s>
<s> 50 for broken vows had early quelled the stainless spirit's vestal flame yes <\s>
<s> whilst the faithful bosom swelled then the envenomed arrow came and apathy's unaltering eye 55 beamed coldness on the misery and early i had learned to scorn the chains of clay that bound a soul panting to seize the wings of morn and where its vital fires were born 60 to soar and spur the cold control which the vile slaves of earthly night would twine around its struggling flight <\s>
<s> oh many were the friends whom fame had linked with the unmeaning name 65 whose magic marked among mankind the casket of my unknown mind which hidden from the vulgar glare imbibed no fleeting radiance there <\s>

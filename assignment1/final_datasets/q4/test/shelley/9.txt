<s> asia i love thee gentlest being and henceforth 30 can cherish thee unenvied speak i pray thy simple talk once solaced now delights <\s>
<s> spirit of the earth mother i am grown wiser though a child cannot be wise like thee within this day and happier too happier and wiser both <\s>
<s> 35 thou knowest that toads and snakes and loathly worms and venomous and malicious beasts and boughs that bore ill berries in the woods were ever an hindrance to my walks o'er the green world and that among the haunts of humankind 40 hard featured men or with proud angry looks or cold staid gait or false and hollow smiles or the dull sneer of self loved ignorance or other such foul masks with which ill thoughts hide that fair being whom we spirits call man 45 and women too ugliest of all things evil though fair even in a world where thou art fair when good and kind free and sincere like thee when false or frowning made me sick at heart to pass them though they slept and i unseen <\s>
<s> 50 well my path lately lay through a great city into the woody hills surrounding it a sentinel was sleeping at the gate when there was heard a sound so loud it shook the towers amid the moonlight yet more sweet 55 than any voice but thine sweetest of all a long long sound as it would never end and all the inhabitants leaped suddenly out of their rest and gathered in the streets looking in wonder up to heaven while yet 60 the music pealed along <\s>
<s> i hid myself within a fountain in the public square where i lay like the reflex of the moon seen in a wave under green leaves and soon those ugly human shapes and visages 65 of which i spoke as having wrought me pain passed floating through the air and fading still into the winds that scattered them and those from whom they passed seemed mild and lovely forms after some foul disguise had fallen and all 70 were somewhat changed and after brief surprise and greetings of delighted wonder all went to their sleep again and when the dawn came wouldst thou think that toads and snakes and efts could e'er be beautiful <\s>
<s> yet so they were 75 and that with little change of shape or hue all things had put their evil nature off i cannot tell my joy when o'er a lake upon a drooping bough with nightshade twined i saw two azure halcyons clinging downward 80 and thinning one bright bunch of amber berries with quick long beaks and in the deep there lay those lovely forms imaged as in a sky so with my thoughts full of these happy changes we meet again the happiest change of all <\s>
<s> 85 asia and never will we part till thy chaste sister who guides the frozen and inconstant moon will look on thy more warm and equal light till her heart thaw like flakes of april snow and love thee <\s>
<s> spirit of the earth what <\s>
<s> as asia loves prometheus <\s>
<s> 90 asia peace wanton thou art yet not old enough <\s>
<s> think ye by gazing on each other's eyes to multiply your lovely selves and fill with sphered fires the interlunar air <\s>
<s> spirit of the earth nay mother while my sister trims her lamp tis hard i should go darkling <\s>
<s> 95 asia listen look <\s>
<s> the spirit of the hour enters prometheus we feel what thou hast heard and seen yet speak <\s>
<s> spirit of the hour soon as the sound had ceased whose thunder filled the abysses of the sky and the wide earth there was a change the impalpable thin air 100 and the all circling sunlight were transformed as if the sense of love dissolved in them had folded itself round the sphered world <\s>
<s> my vision then grew clear and i could see into the mysteries of the universe 105 dizzy as with delight i floated down winnowing the lightsome air with languid plumes my coursers sought their birthplace in the sun where they henceforth will live exempt from toil pasturing flowers of vegetable fire 110 and where my moonlike car will stand within a temple gazed upon by phidian forms of thee and asia and the earth and me and you fair nymphs looking the love we feel in memory of the tidings it has borne 115 beneath a dome fretted with graven flowers poised on twelve columns of resplendent stone and open to the bright and liquid sky <\s>
